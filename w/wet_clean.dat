40|$|We {{found that}} a <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> bath that has an {{interval}} chemical supply and a frequent flow change was quite effective for improving the cleaning performance under a constant value of total chemical supply amount. Using an interval chemical supply suggests a saving of chemical consumption which is environmentally friendly, and has a high throughput process. When wafers were placed with a wide spacing and a narrow spacing {{at the same time}} in the same <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> bath, the particle removal efficiency was decreased noticeably at the narrow spacing compared to a wafer arrangement with equal spacing. In order to prevent the <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> process from decreasing the cleaning performance, there must be a careful consideration of the wafer placement in the <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> bath.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that silicon {{germanium}} (SiGe) is a promising candidate for next generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit (IC) with the advantage of having high electron-hole mobility compare to silicon (Si). The high-k materials are commonly been used for scaling down the gate oxide. However, the passivation strategies between SiGe and high-k gate oxide still need to be understood since the native oxide on the SiGe surface will cause the interface defects and effect the device quality. In the thesis, aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) had been deposited on SiGe (001) substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD). To minimize the defect density between Al₂O₃ and SiGe, two <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> recipes with HF and HF plus (NH₄) ₂S had been developed to both remove the native oxide and chemically passivation SiGe surfaces. Based on cleaning recipes, two studies were performed, one on the effect of ALD temperature on quality on Al₂O₃/SiGe interfaces and the other, on air stability of SiGe surfaces with different <b>wet</b> <b>clean</b> recipes prior to ALD. Al₂O₃/SiGe interfaces were characterized electrically by capacitance-voltage (C-V) spectroscopy and chemically by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS). It has been shown that low-temperature ALD processes have the ability to attain a high interface quality with lower density of interface and border traps. Both cleaning methods led to good air stability up to an hour, extending the viable manufacturing queue time. In addition, sulfur treatment suppressed GeOx formation and increased Al₂O₃ nucleation density on SiGe surfaces, which led to lower leakage current while achieving the record equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 2. 0 nm for Al₂O₃/SiGe device...|$|E

OSG is a brittle material and prone to stress-corrosion cracking reminiscent of that observed in bulk glasses.

Previous work {{has focused on the}} effect of pH, surfactant, and peroxide concentration on the subcritical crack growth of these films. However, little or no attention has focused on the effect of the conjugate acid/base concentration in a buffer. Accordingly, this work examines the “strength” of the buffer solution in both acidic and basic environments. The concentration of the buffer components is varied keeping the ratio of acid/base and therefore pH constant. In addition, the pH was varied by altering the acid/base ratio to ascertain any additional effect of pH. Corrosion tests were conducted with double-cantilever beam fracture mechanics specimens and fracture paths were verified with ATR-FTIR. Shifts in the threshold fracture energy, the lowest energy required for bond rupture in the given environment, GTH, were found to shift to lower values as the concentration of the base in the buffer increased. This effect was found to be much larger than the effect of the hydroxide ion concentration in unbuffered solutions.
