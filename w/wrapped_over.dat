5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{buttons on}} a frock coat were always covered in cloth, often {{to match the}} silk on the revers, showing in the {{triangle}} of lining <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> {{the inside of the}} lapels. Another common feature was the use of fancy buttons with a snow-flake or check pattern woven over it.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recognizable}} muscle car {{version of the}} AMC Rebel was named The Machine and available for the 1970 model year, following {{the success of the}} 1969 SC/Rambler. In its most patriotic or flamboyant factory trim The Machine was painted white featured bold red, white, and blue reflective stripes (made by 3M) on the bodysides that <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the trunk lid.|$|E

25|$|Other {{evidence}} included straw, packaging foam, a bedspread, and waterlogged {{fragments of}} a newspaper later determined to have been The New York Sunday from September 26, 1976. The bedding and newspaper fragments had been <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> some of the body parts. The newspaper {{was linked to the}} northern part of New Jersey, where the perpetrator may have had ties. The bedspread in the suitcases had a reddish-orange color, was made of chenille fabric, and was wrapped around some of the body. It had yellow and pink embroidered flowers.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers {{from the inside of}} the coat <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E
25|$|The early 0-6-0 tank engines were {{fitted with}} either saddle tanks (<b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the boiler) or side tanks (mounted {{at the side}} of the boiler and {{reaching}} down to the running platform). GWR first fitted pannier tanks (mounted on the side of the boiler but not reaching down to the running platform) in 1898 to nine 4-4-0 tank locomotives and, in 1901, to five 0-6-0T locomotives which were also fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. The shape of the Belpaire firebox gives a larger surface area which improves heat transfer and steam production, but their rectangular shape made them difficult to combine with saddle tanks. Locomotives fitted with pannier tanks have a lower centre of gravity than those with saddle tanks (enabling higher speeds on curves), and access for maintenance is easier than for those fitted with side tanks.|$|E

25|$|Long {{before the}} No. 4 Mk I, Britain had {{obviously}} {{settled on the}} rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop {{in place of the}} sling swivel at the front of magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> and attached {{to the rear of the}} nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. No. 1 Mk V rifles were manufactured solely by R.S.A.F. Enfield from 1922–1924, with a total production of roughly 20,000 rifles, all of which marked with a “V”.|$|E
500|$|At first, the {{developers}} {{had no idea}} how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages. Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed Myst to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating [...] "A lot can be done with texture…Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don't necessarily notice, but if they weren't there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Waterboarding was {{characterized}} in 2005 by former CIA director Porter J. Goss as a [...] "professional interrogation technique".

2500|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw {{moderate}} upgrades to the Concord. Front-end styling changed appreciably with a [...] "waterfall" [...] grille {{with a fine}} chrome vertical bar treatment, quad rectangular headlights atop slim, wide clear parking and signal lights, and lighter aluminum bumpers were new for 1979. The D/L sedan was given a new vinyl roof design which extended only over the rear passenger compartment was complemented by chrome trim that overlaid the B-pillar and <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the vinyl roof at its leading edge. A thin trim piece at the roof's edge simulated a convertible's fold-down hinge point. The D/L package, now the middle trim level, was extended to the hatchback, which was given a brushed aluminum Targa-like roof band and a half-vinyl roof to differentiate it from the base model hatchback.|$|E

2500|$|The regimental coat of {{arms and}} {{distinctive}} unit insignia were approved on 16 April 1929, and both were rescinded on 26 February 1959. The distinctive unit insignia consisted of a gold colored metal and enamel device 1 1/16 (2.70 cm) in height with a blue shield and a yellow border. A gold clenched hand with forefinger <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the thumb was {{in the center of}} the shield. The regimental motto, [...] "Mah be-ah" [...] (Shoshone for We Defy) was attached to a scroll at the top of the insignia. The yellow represented the cavalry and the hand represented defiance in Indian Sign Language. The motto was in Shoshone due to the historical presence of Shoshone in the area where the regiment was organized. The {{coat of arms}} was of a similar design except that it omitted the motto and included the Organized Reserve Minuteman crest above the shield.|$|E
2500|$|While dao {{have varied}} greatly over the centuries, most single-handed dao of the Ming period and later, {{and the modern}} swords that are based [...] on them share a number of characteristics. Dao blades are {{moderately}} curved and single-edged, though often with {{a few inches of}} the back edge sharpened as well; the moderate curve allows them to be reasonably effective in the thrust. Hilts are sometimes canted, curving in the opposite direction as the blade which improves handling in some forms of cuts and thrusts. Cord is usually <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> the wood of the handle. Hilts may also be pierced like those of jian (straight-bladed Chinese sword) for the addition of lanyards, though modern swords for performances will often have tassels or scarves instead. Guards are typically disc-shaped often with a cupped shape to prevent rainwater from getting into the sheath, and to prevent blood from dripping down to the handle, making it more difficult to grip. Sometimes guards are thinner pieces of metal with an s-curve, the lower limb of the curve protecting the user's knuckles; very rarely they may have guards like those of the jian.|$|E
2500|$|It wasn't until 1944 {{that the}} railway changed the {{standard}} livery to Indian red {{which is a}} rusty, orange colour, akin to red lead paint. [...] The [...] "Indian Red" [...] paint as produced in the railway's workshop and tended to oxidise over time. [...] Recently repainted locomotives would be a deep red colour {{with a hint of}} orange; those that had not visited the paint shop in some time would be a reddish brown. This was lined out white-black-white, and remained standard until the 1967 re-opening when Lord Ailsa had service locomotives repainted into a fresh [...] "spring" [...] green livery. [...] This was very similar to London and North Eastern Railway apple green. The story goes that the Rev. Teddy Boston, a friend of the Marquess had a model of an Isle of Man locomotive that he had painted in LNER colours. [...] This was shown to Ailsa in the spring of 1967, who liked it, and had 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 15 quickly repainted to match! [...] Spring green became standard livery until nationalization, when the new Isle of Man Railways management decided to repaint the locomotives in a variety of colours to dispel the notion that there were only two engines on the line. [...] The first so treated was No.4 Loch which appeared in a non-standard Midland Red livery for the 1979 season. [...] Two years later No. 11 Maitland appeared in a variation on the Indian red scheme, though she briefly ran in a dull black livery after being used for the BBC production of 'The Ginger Tree' in the late 1980s. [...] There then followed by the most bizarre incarnation of them all, a royal blue No. 12 Hutchinson complete with alleged [...] "Mannin-Style" [...] square cab. [...] This was never popular with the enthusiasts and when the locomotive was reboilered in 2001 she reverted to traditional Beyer, Peacock [...] "house" [...] with its <b>wrapped</b> <b>over</b> front and rear plates. [...] No. 13 Kissack appeared in Brunswick green c.1980, and remained in that livery until withdrawn in 1992. [...] When G H Wood re-entered service in 1993 she took over from Kissack as the dark green locomotive, whilst Sunderland was out-shopped in spring green for the 1998 season.|$|E
