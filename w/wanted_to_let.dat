5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi helped Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him {{a key player in}} South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ helped rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he helped Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and helped to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E

25|$|Mistakes were made. On 1 August 1940. {{a message}} was {{recorded}} by Ambrose Sherwill {{to the people}} in the United Kingdom and especially the children of islanders who had evacuated. With all normal communications shut down, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> these people know that those left behind were not being mistreated and that the Germans were behaving like gentlemen. Accepted as such by most islanders, when broadcast from Germany it was viewed differently in Britain, coming as it did in the midst of the Battle of Britain. The BBC did not repeat the broadcast as requested.|$|E

500|$|The {{first cut}} of the film was two-and-a-half hours long. Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he {{realized}} {{there was a way}} to further trim the film. [...] "There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. We realized that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so intercutting these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E

500|$|By early 1998, Korn {{returned}} to the studio to record Follow the Leader. Even though Korn {{was impressed by the}} work Ross Robinson had done on their previous albums, they decided to work with Steve Thompson and Toby Wright. Robinson did however work with singer Jonathan Davis as a vocal coach for the album. Korn was shown making the video on KornTV. The reason they exposed themselves making the album was because they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> their fans see what they were doing in the studio and behind the scenes. Follow the Leader features numerous guest vocalists, including Ice Cube on [...] "Children of the Korn", Tre Hardson of The Pharcyde on [...] "Cameltosis" [...] and Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst on [...] "All in the Family".|$|E
500|$|California Chrome's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes. Espinoza tried a {{different}} riding tactic {{and let the}} horse go to the lead {{right out of the}} gate. [...] California Chrome led most of the way, and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip, the horse pulled away from the field {{at the top of the}} homestretch and won by [...] lengths. Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go wire to wire... that was the day I found out how much he loves to run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
