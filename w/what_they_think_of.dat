500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the new doctrine. Edwin's priest Coifi responds {{that they may be}} worthwhile; after all, he says, no one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I will do this myself, for now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Consultant Marcus Buckingham and {{executive}} Ashley Goodall, reporting on a large-scale Deloitte performance management survey on Harvard Business Review, {{went as far}} as to say that, contrary to the assumptions underlying performance rating, the rating mainly measured the unique rating tendencies of the rater and thus reveals more about the rater than about the person who is rated. They referred to this as the idiosyncratic rater effect. In view of this effect, they advocate a radically different approach to performance management. In their scenario, 360-degree feedback and similar time-intensive exercises are replaced by team leaders' [...] "performance snapshots"that focus on what they would do with each team member rather than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that individual, and yearly appraisals of past performance are replaced by weekly check-ins among team leader and team member, preferably initiated by the team member, that focus on current and upcoming work.|$|E

40|$|This study explores Franco-American {{relations}} {{by examining}} Franco-American stereotypes. When American participants made ratings <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> the French <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Americans, {{the results showed}} that Americans think the French see Americans in a very negative light. Yet, when the French participants rated <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> Americans <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the French, the result was fairly neutral. Both the French and Americans were found to be over-estimating how negatively they are actually viewed by the other group. If Americans think the French view them negatively and vice versa, these beliefs can permeate interpersonal interactions and can have a potentially negative effect. The results suggest that stereotypes {{play an important role in}} intergroup interactions and these findings have important implications for Franco-American relations...|$|R
