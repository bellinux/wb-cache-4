50|$|With {{the help}} of the flyer winding technology, an {{electric}} coil or winding is produced by feeding the wire via a roll or through a nozzle that is attached to a so-called flyer that is rotating at a certain distance from the coil. The wire is fed by the flyer shaft. For winding the component to be wound, it needs to be fixed inside the winding area of the flyer. It is necessary that the wire is fixed outside of the flyer at any time of the winding procedure. The fixation of the wire is made possible normally by the so-called successive winding method (often used at rotary indexing tables): At the circumference of the table are wire clips or wire deflections that enable a pulling along and with it a fixation of the wire. This will allow a very quick component change, given that no separate depositing of the wire in a <b>wire</b> <b>clip</b> on the machine is required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Fuel leakage in the {{pre-filter}} bowl of {{a diesel}} engine feed pump is the common problem in the field. The leakage of fuel is mainly due to the method of assembly and design of the components. Though the threaded fasteners are easy for maintenance and low cost in the assembly of the components, they are not advisable due to its limitation of loosing the threaded fastener under the dynamic loading. A case study {{has been done in}} the industry to reduce the rejection of feed pump due to leakage of fuel in pre filter {{bowl of a}} diesel engine. In this paper an effort is made to identify the factors which cause the leakage of the fuel. It is found that due to deformation in the <b>wire</b> <b>clip</b> and filter bowl is causing the major problem. Hence analysis of the existing design is made and suggested the improved design using Finite Element Analysis...|$|E

40|$|A coiled {{stainless}} steel <b>wire</b> <b>clip</b> {{was made that}} allowed us to chronically reduce cerebral blood flow in Mongolian gerbils. After 6 weeks of reduced cerebral blood flow in 15 experimental gerbils, we evaluated their learning ability and {{found it to be}} impaired relative to that in 15 control gerbils. Eight weeks after surgery, regional cerebral blood flow in the parietal cortex measured by the hydrogen clearance method in the experimental gerbils was 73 - 76 % of that in the control gerbils. Light microscopy showed minimal histologic changes in the brains of the experimental gerbils. Concentrations of brain proteins analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that among water-soluble brain proteins, the concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins (microtubule-associated protein 2, calspectin, and clathrin) declined in the experimental gerbils. In particular, the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2 declined significantly. Our findings show that the reduction of cerebral blood flow via carotid stenosis impairs the learning behavior in gerbils, with an associated decrease in the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2. We believe that Mongolian gerbils with chronically reduced cerebral blood flow are a useful animal model of chronic brain hypoperfusion. (Stroke 1990; 21 : 1205 - 1209...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} carotid artery {{constriction}} on cerebrovascular ultrastructure and permeability in acute hypertension have been assessed. The right common carotid artery of 26 male Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats was constricted {{with a silver}} <b>wire</b> <b>clip.</b> Forty-eight hours later these animals received an angiotensin amide injection (1 microgram/kg body weight) or infusion for 3 [...] 4 hours (0. 5 or 1. 7 microgram/min/kg body weight) or were subjected to subdiaphragmatic aortic constriction. All animals were injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (20 mg/ 100 g body weight) and sacrificed after 5 [...] 15 minutes. Parietal cortex from both hemispheres was processed for light and electron-microscopic examination. The arterial vessels of the right hemisphere from animals given injections of or infused with angiotensin II exhibited increased permeability to HRP, as manifested {{by the presence of}} reaction product in interendothelial cell clefts, in subendothelial space, in endothelial and smooth muscle cell pinocytotic vesicles, and along smooth muscle cell basal laminas. In contrast, no alterations in the permeability of ipsilateral vessels were seen in rats with aortic constriction. Cerebral cortical arterial vessels from the left hemisphere in all groups of animals exhibited segmental dilatation and constriction and abnormal permeability to HRP. The results suggest that angiotensin administration can produce increased permeability of cerebral cortical vessels in the absence of elevated blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|Single rat neurointermediate lobes (n. i. l. s) {{were fixed}} by their stalks to a {{platinum}} <b>wire</b> <b>clip</b> electrode and incubated in oxygenated Krebs-HEPES medium. Vasopressin release int the medium {{was determined by}} radioimmunoassay. Vasopressin secretion was increased by different stimuli {{and the effects of}} gadolinium (Gd 3 +) were tested. Electrical stimulation (15 Hz, three times 1 min with 1 min intervals) increased vasopressin release in a calcium-dependent manner. Gd 3 + (10 microM to 3 mM) inhibited the evoked release of vasopressin in a concentration-dependent fashion; at 3 mM the inhibition was 98 %. The inhibitory effect of Gd 3 + up to 300 microM was antagonized by increasing the calcium concentration in the medium up to 6 mM. The effects of 1 and 3 mM-Gd 3 + were unaffected by increasing the calcium concentration. Exposure of n. i. l. s to depolarizing concentrations of potassium (high K+, 60 mM, 30 min) increased the vasopressin release more than 33 -fold. The elevated vasopressin release remained constant during six consecutive 5 min periods. In the initial 5 min period 300 microM-Gd 3 + reduced the evoked vasopressin release by 80 % but during the last 5 min period only by 30 %. At 3 mM-Gd 3 + vasopressin release was completely blocked during the whole time of incubation with high K+. Vasopressin release induced by exposure of n. i. l. s to cold (4 degrees C, 20 min) was completely inhibited by 3 mM-Gd 3 +, but reduced by only 25 % in the presence of 300 microM-Gd 3 +. Vasopressin release induced by incubation of n. i. l. s with the ionophore X- 537 A (lasalocid) (10 microM, 30 min) was reduced by 90 % in the presence of 300 microM-Gd 3 + and completely prevented by 3 mM-Gd 3 +. 300 microM-Gd 3 +, added to the incubation medium, had no significant effect on the vasopressin release from crude synaptosomal preparations evoked by high K+. However, when 300 microM-Gd 3 + was already present during the tissue homogenization, the evoked vasopressin release from the synaptosomes was completely blocked. It is concluded that Gd 3 + inhibits exocytotic vasopressin release at two different sites. First, Gd 3 + may block voltage-regulated calcium channels. Secondly, Gd 3 + may inhibit the exocytotic release mechanism by an intracellular site of action. It is speculated that contractile proteins may be the intracellular target for Gd 3 +...|$|E

Objective: Our goal is to describe Step-by-Step the Retzus-sparing RARP surgical technique and report our first Brazilian experience. Methods: We present a case of a 60 -year-old white man with low risk prostate cancer. Surgical materials were four arms Da Vinci robotic platform system, six transperitoneal portals, two prolene <b>wires</b> and Polymer <b>Clips.</b> This surgical technique was step-by-step described according to Galfano et al. One additional step was added as a modification of Galfano et al. Primary technique description: The closure of the Denovellier fascia. Results: We have operated one patient with this technique. The operative time was 180 minutes, console time was 135 min, the blood loss was 150 ml, none perioperative or postoperative complications was found, hospital stay of 01 day. The anatomopathological classification revealed a pT 2 aN 0 M 0 specimen with free surgical margins. The patient achieved continence immediately after bladder stent retrieval. Full erection reported after 30 days of surgery. Conclusion: Retzus-sparing RARP approach is feasible and reproducible.

40|$|ESDA (Electrostatic Discharge Association) ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000 {{requires}} frequent {{testing of}} the voltage leakage {{from the tip of}} a soldering iron and the resistance from the tip of the soldering iron to the common point ground. Without this test apparatus, the process is time-consuming and requires several <b>wires,</b> alligator <b>clips,</b> or test probes, as well as additional equipment. Soldering iron tips must be tested for electrostatic discharge risks frequently, and this typically {{takes a lot of time}} in setup and testing. This device enables the operator to execute the full test in one minute or less. This innovation is a simple apparatus that plugs into a digital multimeter (DMM) and the Common Point Ground (CPG) reference. It enables the user to perform two of the electrostatic discharge tests required in ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000. The device consists of a small black box with two prongs sticking out of one end, two inputs on the opposite end (one of the inputs is used to connect the reference CPG to the DMM), and a metal tab on one side. Inside the box are wires, several washers of various materials, and assembly hardware (nuts and screws/bolts). The device is a passive electronic component that is plugged into a DMM. The operator sets the DMM to read voltage. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The voltage is read and recorded. The operator switches the DMM to read resistance. The operator places the heated tip of the soldering iron onto the metal tab with a small amount of solder to ensure a complete connection. The resistance is recorded. If the recorded voltage and resistance are below a number stated in ESDA ESD STM 13. 1 - 2000, the test is considered to pass. The device includes all the necessary wiring internal to its body so the operator does not need to do any independent wiring, except for grounding. It uses a stack of high-thermal-resistance washers to minimize the heat transfer from the soldering iron to the wiring used to measure the resistance and voltages. This minimizes thermal error. The device allows very rapid execution of a test that is performed frequently...|$|R
