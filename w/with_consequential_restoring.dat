Using a methodology based on a single case study, the research highlights the critical role of middle managers in facilitating knowledge transfer.

The findings of the research suggest that eliminating layers of middle management will inevitably lead to knowledge loss, <b>with</b> <b>consequential</b> implications for competitive advantage. Based on the findings, a typology linking knowledge transfer to organisational forms is proposed. Knowledge management, knowledge loss, management roles...|$|R

Three examples - the problem of fair cake division, the role of competition in the promotion of economic welfare, and bilateral trade restrictions - are invoked to pinpoint the services rendered by procedural considerations in making social welfare judgements. The Pareto libertarian paradox is also re-examined within the extended framework incorporating procedural considerations along <b>with</b> <b>consequential</b> considerations. ...|$|R
