500|$|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is {{considered}} to be an important film in the history of African American cinema. Hollywood studios were led to attempt to replicate the film's success by producing black-oriented films such as Shaft and Super Fly. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song was credited by Variety as leading {{to the creation of the}} blaxploitation genre, largely consisting of exploitation films made by white directors. As Spike Lee states, [...] "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song gave us all the answers we needed. This was an example of how to make a film (a real movie), distribute it yourself, and most important, get paid. Without Sweetback <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> there could have been a [...] She's Gotta Have It, Hollywood Shuffle, or House Party?" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1925, Nella Larsen {{had decided that}} she wanted to be among the [...] "New Negro" [...] writers {{receiving}} considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, [...] "it is the awful Truth. But, <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I." [...] In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.|$|E
500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much else going on, and <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The Tang dynasty poet Du Mu {{mentioned}} Xiang Yu {{in one of}} {{his poems}} Ti Wujiang Ting (題烏江亭): [...] "Victory or defeat is common in battle. One who can endure humiliation is a true man. There are several talents in Jiangdong, <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> he (Xiang Yu) can make a comeback?" [...] However, the Song dynasty poet Wang Anshi had a different opinion, as he wrote, [...] "The warrior is already tired after so many battles. His defeat in the Central Plains is hard to reverse. Although there are talents in Jiangdong, are they willing to help him?" [...] The Song Dynasty female poet Li Qingzhao wrote: [...] "A hero in life, a king of ghosts after death. Until now we still remember Xiang Yu, who refused to return to Jiangdong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Max Kellerman {{after the}} fight, Golovkin said, [...] "It {{was a big}} drama show. [...] is not my fault. I put {{pressure}} on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion." [...] Álvarez {{felt as though he}} won the fight, [...] "In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. [...] "I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw." [...] Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. Álvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, Álvarez said through a translator, “Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we’ll do. You know that’s my style. But right now, <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>if</b> it’s in May or September? But one thing’s for sure – this is my era, the era of Canelo.” Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.|$|E
