The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tree,</b> then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night - for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon - traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market." ...|$|E

Stem, as the biggest mass palm <b>oil</b> <b>tree</b> has not been used commercially due to its lack of quality. One effort in improving quality of palm <b>oil</b> <b>wood</b> is compregnation. Compregnation interpreted as an effort of putting the chemicals into wood structure using prresure. Chemicals that can penetrate into wood structure in this case is melamine formaldehyde resin. The result of research showed that compregnation palm <b>oil</b> <b>wood</b> by melamine formaldehyde increased the specific of gravity of wood from 0, 32 before compregnation to 0, 48, 0, 58 and 0, 65 for 50 %, 75 % and 100 % concentrate.

30|$|We {{prepared}} carpet cleaners containing three <b>wood</b> <b>oils</b> {{extracted from}} Thujopsis dolabrata Sieb. et Zucc. var. hondai Makino, Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl., and Chamaecyparis taiwanensis Masamune et Suzuki and studied {{their effects on}} mites and perfumerists' impressions. The oil concentrations were set at 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.4 %, 0.8 %, and 1.6 %. The effects on Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus Trouessart were investigated. The sensory evaluations were conducted by seven male perfumerists using the SD method and {{they were asked to}} describe freely their impressions of the scents. These results showed that: (1) all three types of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> had a significant effect on making D. pteronyssinus inactive at 0.1 % concentration; and (2) the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> of T. dolabrata evoked refreshing, natural, rich, and intellectual feelings; C. obtusa oil evoked vivacious, rich, and intellectual feelings; and C. taiwanensis evoked refreshing, natural, rich, rough, masculine feelings. According to the test subjects, T. dolabrata evoked “woody” and “earthy” impressions; C. obtusa evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “pine-resin” impressions; and C. taiwanensis evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “medical” impressions. Many issues remain to be investigated, but the inclusion of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> in carpet cleaners offered both good mite control and a pleasant aroma to humans. This study suggests a new potential for using these <b>wood</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R

Haar-based rectangular windows or {{also known as}} Haar-like rectangular features have been popular in face recognition as used in Viola-Jones object detection framework. Similar to face recognition, the <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> recognition would also need a suitable Haar-based rectangular windows that best suit to the characteristics of <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree.</b> A set of seven Haar-based rectangular windows {{have been designed to}} better match specifically the young <b>oil</b> palm <b>tree</b> as the crown size is much smaller compared to the matured ones.

30|$|In 1992, Miyazaki et al.

The participants were six male university students aged between 21 and 22  years, and the experiment was conducted in an artificial climate chamber with the temperature set at 25  °C and humidity at 60 %. The strength of perceptibility of the stimulus was adjusted from “easily sensed” to “slightly sensed” on average, and the stimulation was administered for a duration of 30  min. After olfactory stimulation by the Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil,</b> the systolic blood pressure of the participants decreased by 6 %, which is considered a meaningful reduction (for comparison, {{the difference between the}} high-normal blood pressure of 130  mmHg and normal blood pressure of 120  mmHg is 8.3 %). Task performance increased on average by 4 %, although this change was not statistically significant. In contrast, in tests using eugenol, a component of the clove oil used in dental disinfectants and rated as “uncomfortable” to smell, olfactory stimulation resulted in an increase in pulse rate of 6 %. In 1994, Miyazaki et al. [36] investigated the effects of the different concentration of Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> on blood pressure, pupillary light reflex, and performance. Six female university students aged between 21 and 27  years (mean 22.0  years) participated in this study. To test the perceptibility of the stimulus, three concentrations of Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> were established: “weak”, “easily sensed”, and “strong”. The experiment was conducted in a soundproof artificial climate chamber with the temperature, humidity, and illuminance set at 25  °C, 50 %, and 230  lx, respectively. After olfactory stimulation with Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> rated as a “strong” smell, the participants’ diastolic blood pressure decreased by 8 % and their maximum constriction acceleration, which reflects autonomic nervous activity, increased by 17 %. There was no significant difference; however, the task performance increased by approximately 10 % on average.|$|R
