5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that <b>while</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E

25|$|We {{know little}} {{about the timing of}} language's {{emergence}} in our species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. <b>While</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> doubts that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{property}} losses, the economic ones were also hard.

[...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different.

Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone.

500|$|On November 27, 1989, {{the trial}} {{commenced}} under District Judge David Roth after Taylor waived {{his right to}} a jury. Taylor testified {{on his own behalf}} that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary <b>while</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. Weber County deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene {{at the time of the}} crime. Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident, and masturbated on the corpse. [...] Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the Weber State College crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife and wrapped it around the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor's left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder.|$|E

In an increasingly complex healthcare environment characterized by a shift from hospital to community care, variable and fluctuating work hours, changing patient de-mographics, a growing awareness of patient rights, and the growing public demand for professional preparedness and accountabil-ity, there is a corresponding need to ensure the academic preparation of health profes-sionals meets the expected deliverables and expectations.
