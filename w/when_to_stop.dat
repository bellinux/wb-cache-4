To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked.

5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know <b>when</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E

Focus can be designation of a goal by a higher-level commander, by a peer unit detecting a target, or by intelligence systems that feed information to the swarming units. Convergence is the key feature, which, while it can be distributed, causes swarming units to coordinate their actions, apply force, and know <b>when</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> applying force.|$|E

25|$|Since each branch can be infinite, {{this tree}} {{has to be}} visited breadth-first rather than depth-first. This {{requires}} {{a large amount of}} space, as the breadth of the tree can grow exponentially. A method that may visit some nodes more than once but works in polynomial space is to visit in a depth-first manner with iterative deepening: one first visits the tree up to a certain depth, then increases the depth and perform the visit again. This particular procedure uses the depth (which is also the number of tableau rules that have been applied) for deciding <b>when</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at each step. Various other parameters (such as the size of the tableau labeling a node) have been used instead.|$|E

[...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|E

None of the producers expected him to do so, but with the series already $74,507 in the red and with two more episodes left to film, Desilu had to appear to NBC to be trying to keep to budget. Extensive work was completed during the daylight hours, on the set which had been used for other series such as The Andy Griffith Show, with Floyd's barber shop appearing in some of the shots. The filming continued into the night, and with Pevney running out of time, he was not sure <b>when</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> The problem was that other series such as Rango and Gomer Pyle had the sets booked up for the next several days, and they were unsure whether they would have time to return and film the missing scenes.|$|E
