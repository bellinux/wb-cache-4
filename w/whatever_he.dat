5|$|One Supreme Court lawyer {{alleged that}} his elderly mother was harassed {{by members of}} staff and she {{collapsed}} and suffered a laceration on her chin. Among others, a member of staff in-charge at the airport {{was reported to have}} told him to go do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> could.|$|E

It is purely democratic.|$|E
5|$|He {{could be}} charming or vulgar, {{ebullient}} or sullen, {{he was given}} to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> was, however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E

50|$|The smartest of the quartet, Karl Vierstein is {{sometimes}} nicknamed Computer {{because he has}} an eidetic memory; <b>whatever</b> <b>he's</b> read he never forgets - perhaps because his father is a professor for Maths at the local university.|$|R

5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> thinks best; he must leave that to the common will {{expressed}} by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este. Paulucci met, {{during one of}} his Italian licence periods, Carlo Felice in Turin, and resolved to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> can to help him. Paulucci's later efforts at the Russian court were indeed essential in stopping the Austrian ambitions at the Verona's congress. Memoring these good services, the King Carlo Felice invited Paulucci in Piedmont in 1829, and the two started a close friendship.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> catches on the {{condition}} that Gawain give him <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

At this point, this power has not been formally introduced. Also, he may be immune to the powers of the other characters, as The Barista's foam message had no effect on him (Though Caesar claims this is because Vorhees is illiterate).|$|R
5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> {{had to do to}} survive. In the time spent in the brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Mara {{replaced}} Gibson as the team's president {{before the}} 1927 season. He told March to spend <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> felt necessary {{to build a}} championship caliber team. March overhauled the roster and the team finished 11–1–1, while winning its first NFL championship. They barely broke even financially however, and the team was still giving away as many as 4,000 tickets a game. Mara decided to reduce costs the following season, and instead of traveling first class, the Giants drove to games in a used bus, and stayed at local YMCAs instead of hotels. The team had to push the bus once for several miles when it broke down, and players had trouble sleeping at the Y. They won only four games, and Mara lost $40,000.|$|E
5|$|Rabi chaired Columbia's physics {{department}} from 1945 to 1949, {{during which}} time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a research scientist (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a doctoral student (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, a doctoral student of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Nearly as {{important}} as Joan of Arc {{in the cause of}} Charles was the support of the powerful and wealthy family of his wife Marie d'Anjou, particularly his mother-in-law, Queen Yolande of Aragon. But <b>whatever</b> affection <b>he</b> may have had for his wife, or <b>whatever</b> gratitude <b>he</b> may have felt for the support of her family, the great love of Charles VII's life was his mistress, Agnès Sorel.|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

50|$|When Robert Conrad hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC (January 23, 1982), he {{appeared}} in a parody of The Wild Wild West.

Lincoln dispatches West and Gordon (Joe Piscopo) {{to find out what}} Grant drinks. They discover that Grant is held captive by Velvet Jones (Eddie Murphy).|$|R

5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E
