5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a <b>wedge</b> <b>shape.</b> Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

25|$|The 75 was {{introduced}} in May 1985 to replace the Giulietta (with which it shared many components), and was named to celebrate Alfa's 75th year of production. The body, designed by head of Alfa Romeo Centro Stile Ermanno Cressoni, was styled in a striking <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> tapering at the front with square headlights and a matching grille (similar features were applied to the Cressoni-designed 33).|$|E

25|$|When {{schooling}} fish stop to feed, {{they break}} ranks and become shoals. Shoals {{are more vulnerable}} to predator attack. The shape a shoal or school takes depends {{on the type of}} fish and what the fish are doing. Schools that are travelling can form long thin lines, or squares or ovals or amoeboid shapes. Fast moving schools usually form a <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> while shoals that are feeding tend to become circular.|$|E
25|$|One {{uniqueness}} of this whistle {{compared to the}} others described is that {{the length of the}} feedback path can be chosen arbitrarily.

25|$|Of {{the four}} 4WD projects, the Lotus team were {{undoubtedly}} the most committed. The {{design of the}} car {{was influenced by the}} all-conquering Lotus 49 and the two 4WD gas turbine cars Lotus had entered in the Indy 500, and as well as its <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> the later Lotus 72 would also inherit its inboard front brakes. As with the Matra and McLaren cars, the 63 featured a back-to-front DFV with a bespoke Hewland gearbox and a Ferguson 4WD transmission with provision to adjust the front-rear torque distribution between 50–50 and 30–70.|$|E

Currently, {{automatic}} detection of <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped</b> defects in Scanning Laser Polarimetry (SLP) {{images of the}} RNFL is not available. An automatic classification is currently based only on global parameters, thereby ignoring important local information. Our method works by a modified dynamic programming technique that searches for locally strong edges with a preference for straight edges. These edges are initially classified based on their strength and next combined into <b>wedge</b> <b>shaped</b> defects.

25|$|According to {{the works}} of Friedrich A. Schott and Julian P. McCreary Jr., the Northeastward Somali current has the {{following}} two sub-season periods. During June–July, the Great Whirl grows at 4-10°N, and a cold <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> water mass develops to the offshore at latitude 10-12°N. The size and strength of the Great Whirl during the summer monsoon is measured as 10cm/s velocity at about 1000 m depth, while some visible gyre structure is observed at further depth. The upper layer Somali Current flows northwards along the East African coast, and finally enters the Gulf of Aden between the Socotra Archipelago and the Horn of Africa. The mean flow velocity of this outgoing current is about 5 Sv.|$|E
25|$|The first {{classification}} {{is a type}} 1 jetty. This type of jetty {{is significantly}} longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 {{at the mouth of}} Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.|$|E
500|$|Constructed {{during the}} Neolithic, cairns in the Severn-Cotswold {{tradition}} share several characteristics: an elongated trapezoidal (or <b>wedge)</b> <b>shape</b> up to [...] long; a cairn (a mound of deliberately placed stones or rocks erected {{as a memorial}} or marker); a revetment (retaining wall) of carefully constructed dry-stone walling that also defines a horned forecourt at the widest end; huge capstones supported by orthostats; and a chamber (or chambers) in which human remains were placed, accessible after the cairn was completed {{by way of a}} gallery (passageway). Diverse internal transept chamber plans exist within the group. The earlier tombs contained multiple chambers set laterally, or pairs of transept chambers leading from a central passageway; the later, terminally chambered tombs, contained a single chamber.|$|E

500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a trunnion height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> with a sloping roof.|$|E
2500|$|The {{caissons}} ran on {{a railway}} track of [...] gauge with [...] flat bottom rails on longitudinal timbers, on a gradient of 1 in 10. There were two tracks.

A continuous rack was fixed to the longitudinal timbers, and a pawl—Leslie calls it a [...] "pall"—attached to the carriage was arranged to engage the rack if the tension was let off the haulage cable.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{documents}} unequivocally {{written in}} Sumerian date to c. 3000 BC at Jemdet Nasr. Originally, pictographs were either drawn on clay tablets in vertical columns with a sharpened reed stylus or incised in stone. This early style lacked the characteristic <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> of the strokes. Certain signs to indicate names of gods, countries, cities, vessels, birds, trees, etc., {{are known as}} determinatives, and were the Sumerian signs of the terms in question, added {{as a guide for}} the reader.

2500|$|Western {{books from}} the fifth century onwards were bound between hard covers, with pages made from {{parchment}} folded and sewn on to strong cords or ligaments that were attached to wooden boards and covered with leather. Since early books were exclusively handwritten on handmade materials, sizes and styles varied considerably, {{and there was no}} standard of uniformity. [...] Early and medieval codices were bound with flat spines, and {{it was not until the}} fifteenth century that books began to have the rounded spines associated with hardcovers today. Because the vellum of early books would react to humidity by swelling, causing the book to take on a characteristic <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> the wooden covers of medieval books were often secured with straps or clasps. These straps, along with metal bosses on the book's covers to keep it raised off the surface that it rests on, are collectively known as furniture.|$|E
2500|$|On {{spotting}} the islanders, Mar organised his force {{into battle}} array, {{with the main}} army behind a small advance guard of men-at-arms under Sir James Scrymgeour (Constable of Dundee, the hereditary standard-bearer of Scotland) and Sir Alexander Ogilvie of Auchterhouse (Sheriff of Angus). He probably split the army into three, with the knights as a cavalry reserve and the infantry arranged in schiltrons, close-packed arrays of spearmen. There {{is no mention of}} significant numbers of archers. The islanders were arranged in the traditional [...] or <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> with Hector MacLean commanding the right wing and the chief of Clan Mackintosh on the left. At first the clansmen launched themselves at Scrymgeour's men, but failed to make much impression on the armoured column and many were slain. However, every wave of islanders that was repulsed, was replaced by fresh men. Meanwhile, Mar led his knights into the main body of Donald's army with similar results. The islanders brought down the knights' horses and then used their dirks to finish off the riders.|$|E
2500|$|Monitor loudspeakers, {{also called}} [...] "foldback" [...] loudspeakers, are speaker {{cabinets}} {{which are used}} onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or {{a section of the}} stage. [...] They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system. [...] Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> directing their output upwards towards the performer when set {{on the floor of the}} stage. [...] Two-way, dual driver designs with a speaker cone and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage. [...] These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for a few people who are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker. [...] Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. In the 2000s, a number of manufacturers produced powered monitor speakers, which contain an integrated amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|According to the pathologist, John Burton Cleland, {{the man was}} of [...] "Britisher" [...] {{appearance}} and thought to be aged about 40–45; he was in [...] "top physical condition". He was [...] "180 centimetres (5ft 11 in) tall, with hazel eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair, slightly grey around the temples, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, hands and nails that {{showed no signs of}} manual labour, big and little toes that met in a <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles like those of a ballet dancer. These can be dominant genetic traits (dystonia of the toes), and they are also a characteristic of many middle and long-distance runners." [...] He was dressed in a white shirt, red and blue tie, brown trousers, socks and shoes and a brown knitted pullover and fashionable grey and brown double-breasted jacket. All labels on his clothes had been removed, and he had no hat (unusual for 1948) or wallet. The body was clean-shaven and carried no identification, which led police to believe he had committed suicide. His teeth did not match the dental records of any known living person. Coroner Cleland remarked that if the body had been carried to its final resting place then [...] "all the difficulties would disappear".|$|E
