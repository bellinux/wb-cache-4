5|$|When Nintendo {{published}} {{the game in}} North America, the packaging design featured {{a small portion of}} the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a <b>warranty</b> <b>card</b> became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E

50|$|Surveys {{have the}} {{advantages}} of being inexpensive, require no testing equipment, and results reflect the users' opinions. When written carefully and given to actual users who have experience with the product and knowledge of design, surveys provide useful feedback on the strong and weak areas of the usability of a design. This is a very common method and often {{does not appear to}} be a survey, but just a <b>warranty</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E

50|$|On March 28, 2015, Best Buy Canada {{announced}} that the Future Shop chain had ceased business, effective immediately. 66 locations were permanently closed, and the remaining 65 locations were soft launched as Best Buy locations on April 4, 2015. In the months that followed, the locations were renovated to adopt Best Buy's branding and store format. Best Buy argued that these closures and re-brandings were intended to reduce redundancy, as the affected stores were located within close proximity of a Best Buy. The closures resulted {{in the loss of}} 1,000 part-time and 500 full-time jobs. In turn, Best Buy {{announced that}} it would invest at least $200 million into its remaining Canadian locations over the next two years, including increased staffing and the introduction of home appliance departments in all of its Canadian locations. Canadian Best Buy locations will honour Future Shop <b>warranties</b> and gift <b>cards.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Every time {{a credit}} card or a store loyalty card is being used, or a <b>warranty</b> <b>card</b> is being filled, data is being {{collected}} about the users behavior.

5000|$|The Px4 is {{available}} in [...]45 ACP designated as the Px4 Storm SD (Special Duty). Notable differences between the standard [...]45 ACP and the Special Duty are the desert tan frame color, PVD coated magazines and internal firing control assembly, double recoil spring, specially roll marked slide and a longer barrel to facilitate {{the use of a}} suppressor. The PVD coated magazines (one 9- and two 10-round magazines come with the package) are not scheduled to be imported and there will only be one production run of the Px4SD. Supplies are limited. Initial photos show the barrel with a silver proprietary coating but the production models have a black finished barrel. Also, pistol tags indicate that superluminova sight paint is standard but Beretta USA discontinued use of the paint in 2009 so the Px4SD will have standard white 3-dot sights. The special Pelican case contains oil, cleaning kit, three magazines, pistol, all three back straps, all three magazine buttons, manual, <b>warranty</b> <b>card</b> and two foam dividers.|$|E
