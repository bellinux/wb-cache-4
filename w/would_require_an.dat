5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found {{on two of the}} engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E

5|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for the Moon's formation 4.51 billion years ago, and some 60 million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System. These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force (which would require too great an initial spin of Earth), the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon (which <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon), and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk (which does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon). These hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians {{had been}} {{preparing}} for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, {{under the guidance of}} the politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians. The Athenians did not have the man-power to fight on land and sea; therefore combatting the Persians <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> alliance of several Greek city states. In 481 BC Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two states.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

30|$|Thought reform <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> {{reform of}} {{teaching}} (in primary school, secondary school, university), {{that in turn}} <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> reform of thought. Clearly, the democratization {{of the right to}} think <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> paradigm revolution which would allow complex thought to reorganize knowledge and connect the fields of knowledge that today are confined within the disciplines. […] Thought reform is a key anthropological and historical problem. This implicates a mental revolution even more important than the Copernican revolution. Never before in the history of humanity have the responsibilities of thinking been so huge. The heart of the tragedy also lies in thought. [38, 44].|$|R

5|$|This {{planning}} depth is {{also seen}} {{in the presence of}} exotic raw materials at a variety of sites throughout the MSA. Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km. Obtaining raw materials from this distance <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> awareness of the resources, a perceived value in the resources, whether it be functional or symbolic, and, possibly, the ability to organize an exchange network in order to obtain the materials.|$|E
5|$|When {{the camp}} opened, Butlin {{realised}} that his guests were not engaging with {{activities in the}} way he had envisioned, as most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he <b>would</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed.|$|E

Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E
