If the bystander is familiar with the environment, {{they are more likely to}} know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help, where the exits are, etc. Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation.|$|E
25|$|In December 1982, Webb, Howard Emmett Bramblett {{of nearby}} Ocoee, and David Parks {{decided to start}} {{manufacturing}} illegal M-80 and M-100 fireworks in an old metal dairy barn on the farm. Bramblett, who owned a fireworks store in Benton and {{had a history of}} involvement with illegal fireworks, had reportedly taught Webb and Parks how to manufacture these fireworks and <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the materials. They employed several family members of Webb and Parks. Most employees were unaware and not educated in the dangerous working conditions. Between December 1982 and the date of the explosion, at least 1,542,000 of the M-series fireworks were reported to have been manufactured at the factory and distributed to at least twelve states. Months before the explosion, the Polk County Sheriff's Office, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) had received word of an illegal fireworks operation in the area, but were uncertain of the location.|$|E

500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, O'Connell {{published}} Lyrics, a book {{of poetry}} evincing a [...] "Celtic strain." [...] The poetry displays O'Connell's sense of sunt lacrimae rerum, {{that there will be}} tears with trials, and it expresses his bittersweet joy in life's evanescent pleasures. O'Connell wrote an Irish-themed play, The Red Fox, which was staged with moderate success in San Francisco about 1882. O'Connell wrote [...] "Ghoul's Quest" [...] for The Argonaut. In 1891, he published The Inner Man: Good Things to Eat and Drink and <b>Where</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> Them, a collection of anecdotes and advice for the epicurean who finds himself in the San Francisco area, and a cautionary description of common 19th century food adulterants such as chemical dyes and powdered lead.|$|E

2500|$|Lovins {{explains}} that {{many companies are}} already enjoying the financial and other rewards that come from saving electricity. Yet progress in converting to electricity saving technologies has been slowed by the indifference or outright opposition of some utilities. A second obstacle to efficiency is that many electricity-using devices are purchased by people who won’t be paying their running costs and thus {{have little incentive to}} consider efficiency. [...] Lovins also believes that many customers [...] "don't know what the best efficiency buys are, <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them, or how to shop for them".|$|E

In the book, Patton {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "Faith No More played Eureka in a pizza parlour place Mr. Bungle played dozens of times. There were 6 people there and 3 of them were my friends. It was really bad, a really pathetic show and I {{remember}} them standing around the van really upset. Puffy was really uptight wanting to know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> weed.

2500|$|The {{conduction}} {{of nerve}} impulses {{is an example}} of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) there have to be more photons, as the photons can't become [...] "stronger" [...] for a specific frequency.|$|E
2500|$|When Blackwell {{arrived at}} the college, she was rather nervous. Nothing was familiar– the surroundings, the {{students}} and the faculty. She did not even know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her books. However, she soon found herself at home in medical school. [...] While she was at school, she was looked upon as an oddity by the townspeople of Geneva. She also rejected suitors and friends alike, preferring to isolate herself. In the summer between her two terms at Geneva, she returned to Philadelphia, stayed with Dr. Elder, and applied for medical positions in the area to gain clinical experience. The Guardians of the Poor, the city commission that ran Blockley Almshouse, granted her permission to work there, albeit not without some struggle. Blackwell slowly gained acceptance at Blockley, although some young resident physicians still would walk out and refuse to assist her in diagnosing and treating her patients. During her time there, Blackwell gained valuable clinical experience, but was appalled by the syphilitic ward and those afflicted with typhus. Her graduating thesis at Geneva Medical College ended up being on the topic of typhus. The conclusion of this thesis linked physical health with socio-moral stability– a link that foreshadows her later reform work.|$|E
