40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceRaphael A. YunkSustainable {{design and}} green {{engineering}} practices {{have become a}} priority in the architectural design industry {{over the past few}} years. Energy codes and standards have become more stringent as energy costs rise and buildings become larger, consuming more energy and having a larger impact on the environment. One major area for improvement to meet these new requirements is in the lighting area. Kansas State University (KSU) in Manhattan, KS has had the same campus <b>walkway</b> <b>lighting</b> system for over 50 years and it does not meet the current energy codes and standards. This paper will perform a case study of the current <b>walkway</b> <b>lighting</b> system on the KSU campus, specifically focusing on the Quad area and applying the same principles to the entire campus. The illumination and fixture distribution characteristics will first be established and analyzed to determine an accurate baseline for later comparison. Issues regarding the illumination, efficiency, aesthetics, maintenance, and landscaping will be addressed once the current conditions are established. Lighting technology has changed dramatically in the past year with the development of high efficiency fluorescent, induction, and light emitting diode (LED) lighting. New LED technology has proven to be the most efficient and has been adapted to create outdoor LED fixtures that could help KSU surpass the current energy standards and improve the overall quality of light to correct some of the current issues the existing lighting creates. A full analysis of the illumination, efficiency, aesthetics, and economic feasibility will be performed. The economic analysis will compare existing maintenance and energy costs to that of the first-cost with maintenance, and energy costs to determine an estimated payback. Once the analysis is complete, future options for KSU to implement new lighting technology will be discussed. By creating a more environmentally conscious campus, using high efficiency lighting, KSU could set an example for other universities to pursue sustainable technology and design...|$|R

The renovation extends to the facades of 32 buildings that face the plaza, as well as infrastructure projects such as water, drainage and cable burial. New pavement and sidewalks are being installed in the neighboring streets of Republica de Perú, San Camilito, Republica de Honduras, Monteros and Amargura.

40|$|Photovoltaic linear {{concentrator}} arrays {{can benefit from}} high performance solar cell technologies being developed at AstroPower. Specifically, these are the integration of thin GaAs solar cell and epitaxial lateral overgrowth technologies with the application of monolithically interconnected solar cell (MISC) techniques. This MISC array has several advantages which make it ideal for space concentrator systems. These are high system voltage, reliable low cost monolithically formed interconnections, design flexibility, costs that are independent of array voltage, and low power loss from shorts, opens, and impact damage. This concentrator solar cell will incorporate the benefits of light trapping by growing the device active layers over a low-cost, simple, PECVD deposited silicon/silicon dioxide Bragg reflector. The high voltage-low current output results in minimal 12 R losses while properly designing the device allows for minimal shading and resistance losses. It is possible to obtain open circuit voltages as high as 67 volts/cm of solar cell length with existing technology. The projected power density for the high performance device is 5 kW/m for an AMO efficiency of 26 % at 1 5 X. Concentrator solar cell arrays are necessary to meet the power requirements of specific mission platforms and can supply high voltage power for electric propulsion systems. It is anticipated that the high efficiency, GaAs monolithically interconnected {{linear concentrator}} solar cell array will enjoy widespread application for space based solar power needs. Additional applications include remote man-portable or ultra-light unmanned air vehicle (UAV) power supplies where high power per area, high radiation hardness and a high bus voltage or low bus current are important.
