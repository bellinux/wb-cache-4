40|$|It is {{well known}} that two main flow regimes are present in bubble columns, being the {{evaluation}} of transition between homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes of crucial importance for reactor design. For air–water systems, several models have been satisfactorily proposed to explain this phenomenon. However when gas–liquid–solids systems are considered, solid particles influence on regime transition is not yet clear, in spite of the amount of research developed over the past years. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of a specific solid phase – spent grains – on homogeneous regime stability and regime transition. Spent grains are cellulose-based particles that have been used to immobilize cells on biotechnology process. These particles are wettable and have a density close to water and its influence on bubble column reactors is particularly important in order to establish the limits were both regimes prevail. A cylindrical Plexiglax BC of 18 L volume was used with air, water and spent grains at different concentrations (0 – 20 % (<b>wt.</b> <b>WET</b> BASIS/vol.)) as gas, liquid and solid phases. Regime transition was determined according to the drift-flux and slip speed concept. It was found that at studied concentrations of spent grains, critical gas hold-up decreases as solids concentration increases. At the highest solids concentration and lowest gas flow rates no fluidization of the solid phase was observed. It is believed that the critical hold-up decrease was mainly due to bubble coalescence, as larger bubbles were observed when heterogeneous regime was present. This coalescence may be caused by the non-uniform distribution of solid phase on the column and the interaction of spent grains with bubbles in the liquid–gas interfac...|$|E

Observed mean PAHs levels in the samples ranged from below detection limit (BD) of analytical instrument to 22. 400  ±  0. 050  μg kg− 1 <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> in Littorina littorea, BD to 87. 400  ±  0. 030  μg kg− 1 <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> in Crassostrea virginica and from BD to 171. 000  ±  0. 430  μg kg− 1 <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> in Periophthalmus koeleuteri. The highest average concentration of 171. 000  ±  0. 430  μg kg− 1 <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> was recorded for Indeno [1, 2, 3 -cd]pyrene from Sime water. High molecular weight PAHs (HMW-PAHs) were generally predominant compared to low molecular weight PAHs (LMW-PAHs). The LMW- PAH/HMW-PAH ratio was < 1 for all species, indicating anthropogenic origin of PAHs in the coastal waters of Niger Delta environment.

The transit time in these patients was accelerated by a laxative, metoclopramide, and colonic lavage. The presence of 5 -ASA in the mucosa was confirmed by autofluorescence. The highest concentrations of 5 -ASA were obtained after Asacol (mean (SEM), 298 - 5 (37. 3) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt),</b> followed by Claversal 500 mg (108. 8 (11 - 7) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt)</b> and Pentasa (25. 7 (2 - 2) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt).</b> Very low concentrations only were observed after Claversal 250 mg (0. 3 (0. 03) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt),</b> Salazopyrine (1 - 2 (0. 1) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt),</b> and Dipentum (11. 0 (3. 2) ng/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt).</b> The results for Ac- 5 -ASA were similar but the {{concentrations were}} generally lower. Serum concentration-time curves over eight hours were obtained from 34 healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 400 to 500 mg of the different drugs. For the slow release forms, an apparently inverse relationship {{was found between the}} area under the curve of the serum concentrations and the intramucosal concentrations, supporting the importance of the local availability of the drug. This inverse relationship was absent for the azo-bound drugs. Colonic washout induced mechanical removal of intraluminal 5 -ASA with a secondary disturbance in absorption resulting in a rapid decline in the serum concentrations. However, only for Dipentum did this result in significantly lower 5 -ASA mucosal concentrations. This is the first reported attempt to evaluate the mucosal availability of 5 -ASA after different oral preparations. It shows that where transit time is accelerated higher mucosal concentrations occur after slow release preparations (except for Claversal 250 mg) than after azo-bound drugs. Additional studies are necessary to correlate these concentrations with clinical effects...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Specific binding of 3 H-saxitoxin (STX) {{was used}} to quantitate the density of voltage-sensitive sodium {{channels}} in developing rat skeletal muscle. In adult triceps surae, a single class of sites with a KD = 2. 9 nM and a density of 21 fmol/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> was detected. The density of these high-affinity sites increased from 2. 0 fmol/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> to the adult value in linear fashion during days 2 - 25 after birth. Denervation of the triceps surae at day 11 or 17 reduced final saxitoxin receptor site density to 10. 4 or 9. 2 fmol/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt,</b> respectively, without changing KD. Denervation of the triceps surae at day 5 did not alter the subsequent development of saxitoxin receptor sites during days 5 - 9 and accelerated the increase of saxitoxin receptor sites during days 9 - 13. After day 13, saxitoxin receptor development abruptly ceased and the density of saxitoxin receptor sites declined to 11 fmol/mg <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> These {{results show that the}} regulation of high-affinity saxitoxin receptor site density by innervation is biphasic. During the first phase, which is independent ofcontinuing innervation, the saxitoxin receptor density increases to 47 - 57 % of the adult level.

40|$|The nekton {{community}} was sampled by a Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT 25) over the upper 1000 m of the Scotia Sea dunng January 1991. A total of 81 nekton and micronekton species {{were collected from}} 2 sites, one in the oceanlc western Scotia Sea (Stn 1) {{and the other on}} the northwestern slope of the South Georgia shelf (Stn 2). Species composition, abundance, biomass and day/night vertical distribution were investigated. Crustaceans were the most important group in terms of species numbers (28 species) followed by mesopelagic fish (24), molluscs (15) and coelenterates (11). Species diversity increased with depth and was higher at Stn 2 (76 species) than at Stn 1 (62 specles). Biomass in the upper 1000 m was considerably higher at Stn 1 (94. 6 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 during daytime, 87 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 during night) than at Stn 2 (10. 2 and 23. 7 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2, respectively), mostly due to dense concentrations of the tunicate Salpa thompsoni (41. 6 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 during night). The other main contributors to the high biomass at Stn 1 were coelenterates (28. 3 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 during night) and mesopelagic fish (4. 9 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 during night). Euphausiids (Euphausia triacantha and E. superba) accounted for 1. 5 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2 at Stn 2 during night, with E. triacantha the more important of the two (1. 4 g <b>wet</b> <b>wt</b> m- 2). Except for Bathylagus antarcticus all common mesopelagic fishes showed a marked diurnal vertical migration (i. e. Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus brauen, Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini). During daylight they stayed in the core of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW, 400 to 800 m) and at night they were mainly distnbuted in the Antarctic Surface Water (ASW, 0 to 400 m). Other species with pronounced vertical migration were the hydromedusa Calycopsis borchgrevinki, the squid Brachioteuthis ?picta, and the euphausiid Euphausia triacantha. The scyphomedusae Atolla wyvillei and Periphylla periphylla and the crustaceans Cyphocaris richardi, Gigantocypris mulleri and Pasiphaea scotiae did not appear to migrate and remained concentrated in the CDW. Spatial variability was analysed by multivariate data analyses (clustering techniques) and related to hydrography. Four main groups, characterised by different nekton communities, were derived: (1) a lower mesopelagic nekton community from the deeper layers of the CDW, apparent at both stations, (2) an upper mesopelagic nekton community from the core of the CDW, apparent at both stations, (3) an epipelagic nekton community from the ASW over the South Georgia slope (Stn 2) and finally (4) an epipelagic nekton community from the ASW of the oceanic Scotia Sea (Stn 1). The performance of the midwater trawl is discussed as it has a substantial impact on the catchability of the nekton. The presented data provide new information on the structure and spatial variability of Antarchc nekton communities and emphasise the geographical and vertical discontinuities between communities...|$|R

The available data {{were limited to}} BT accumulation in surface sea water, sediment, bivalves and fish collected sporadically at restricted areas in 1998 and 2001 - 2005 showing the presence of ‘hot spots’ in the country. BT concentrations in sediments (dry <b>wt),</b> bivalves (<b>wet</b> <b>wt)</b> and fish (<b>wet</b> <b>wt)</b> in hot spots (big harbors in Bitung, Jakarta, Surabaya and Medan were in range of 209 - 425, 23 - 320, 5 - 64 and 0. 41 - 19 ng g, respectively, mostly in order of TBT>DBT>MBT. Occurrence of imposex in gastropods (Thais spp) has been also detected in 1989 in a remote island, Ambon Island. Among locations surveyed, commercial harbors and marina are highly contaminated, and in particular BTs levels in sediments of harbors are hundreds folds that in the fisheries areas, indicating the major input of BTs are from antifouling paints of ships. Sediments are of great concern as the deposited BTs could be potential sources in the future, even if after the global ban had been effectively implemented. Moderate levels of BTs in aquaculture areas have revealed the usage of BTs as biocides in aquaculture industries as well. This review shows the BT contamination has been in critical levels, since no restriction applied in this country, fresh input of BTs into the marine environment perhaps continues, and could expand and threaten continuously aquatic ecosystem in Asia-Pacific region, considering the geographical position of Indonesian waters.

40|$|Knowledge {{of mercury}} {{concentrations}} in fish {{is essential for}} human health protection. Mercury is a naturally occurring element {{that acts as a}} neurotoxin to humans and other species. The biologically available mercury form, methylmercury (MeHg), bio accumulates from small benthic invertebrates to large pelagic fish, and therefore high end consumers and terminal predators have elevated Hg concentrations. The main pathway of MeHg exposure in humans is by consumption of contaminated fish. In this study total Hg concentrations were measured in 10 Gulf of Mexico pelagic fish species using a DMA 80 analyzer. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 004 to 3. 55 ppm (<b>wet</b> <b>wt).</b> The highest mean concentration (1. 04 ppm, <b>wet</b> <b>wt)</b> recorded in king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) exceeded FDA recommended criteria of 1 ppm. Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) had lowest mean Hg concentrations (< 0. 3 ppm). The rest of the species were above the EPA advisory level of 0. 3 ppm.

40|$|The {{effects of}} diet and {{exercise}} on glycogen content in skeletal muscle were investigated in adult male ICR mice. After one night fasting and 90 min of swimming, glycogen depletion occurred in both red and white vastus laterahs. After normal mixed diet, the glycogen content increased and reached supercompensated levels. In red vastus, the glycogen content became 3. 5 {{times as much as}} normal level. However, there was little increase on glycogen content after non-carbohydrate fat diet. When both groups with supercompensated and depleted glycogen contents were run for 30 min at 15 m/min, plasma lactate level in both groups was constant, suggesting exercise intensity was mild. Plasma FFA level in fat fed group was higher than normal mixed diet group before exercise and decreased gradually during exercise. Glycogen content in normal mixed diet group decreased from preexercise level of 25. 0 ± 9. 6 /μmol/g <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> in white vastus and 36. 8 ± 9. 5 μmol/g <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> in red vastus to 14. 5 ± 9. 7 μmol/g <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> and 10. 0 ± 4. 3 μmol/g <b>wet</b> <b>wt.</b> respectively after 30 min of exercise, whereas there was little change on glycogen content in fat fed mice during exercise.
