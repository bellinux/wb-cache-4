However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They eat <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects. They therefore have [...] "negligible value" [...] in biological control.|$|E

[...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing.

500|$|Although the {{references}} to Illuminatus! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part {{intended to be a}} self-parodying dredge of The KLF's [...] "myth". [...] Drummond's opinions of the [...] "rock 'n' roll comeback" [...] were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000: [...] "The history of rock 'n' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks.... No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and {{will never be the same}} as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub-cult.... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." [...] Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were [...] "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature of the whole thing, the desperation of all concerned to exploit <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> from the myth...".|$|E
500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> so we've got as much {{material}} to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is Gone is the band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor drove home every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I {{have to say that the}} band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process had some problems, but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E

All three will try to scavenge <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more scraps [...] than normal for the smaller animal.

2500|$|The Israeli Air Force took an {{extensive}} part in IDF operations during the al-Aqsa Intifada, including the controversial targeted killings of Palestinian terrorist leaders, most notably Salah Shakhade, Ahmed Yassin and Abed al-Aziz Rantissi. While this policy was criticized {{due to the}} collateral damage caused in certain instances, Israel claims it is vital in its fight against terrorism and that IAF pilots do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to avoid civilian casualties, including aborting strikes. In 2007, Israel achieved a civilian casualty ratio of 1:30, or one civilian casualty for every thirty combatant casualties, in its airstrikes on militants in the Palestinian territories. Alan Dershowitz noted that [...] "No army in history has ever had a better ratio of combatants to civilians killed in a comparable setting".|$|E
