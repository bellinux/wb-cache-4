25|$|There is {{no direct}} {{evidence}} of how the turrets were used, or <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> they were intended to serve; however, it can be presumed {{that they were to}} provide regular observation posts. It is clear that the structures also provided temporary accommodation for soldiers manning them, though {{there is no evidence that}} the soldiers slept in them. It is more probable that they were based in the milecastles or forts, and manned the turrets in rotation. Given the presumed requirement to provide a reliable 24-hour watch, limited by the size of the structure, it is supposed that there may have been four to six soldiers stationed at a turret at any one time.|$|E
25|$|Since his {{childhood}} Haridas Baba had accepted disciplined life as essential in spiritual progress. He became a monk and adopted silence {{as a way}} of seeking inner peace. For health reasons, and to eliminate digestive problems he had with his liver, he chose to drink a glass of milk once or twice a day instead of taking solid food. Since the early days of his association with Neem Karoli he encountered several obstacles in his observance of silence, or eating habits. During one Kumbha Mela, he was obligated by Neem Karoli to break those monastic rules for the reason of following the house rules as having higher but whimsical priority ("What is this rule? For <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> is it made?").|$|E
25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} <b>what</b> <b>purpose.</b> This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> the {{inscription}} of the futhorc served, but Page suggests it cannot be simply decorative, but {{must have had}} a magical significance. [...] He notes that the carving of runic letters on swords as a form of magical protection was an ancient practice, but by the 9th century rune lore was probably on the decline in the Kingdom of Kent, and the owner of the seax may have commissioned an archaic runic inscription for prestige purposes. [...] The fact that there are errors in the order and design of the runic letters suggests that the smith who made the seax was not used to adding such runic inscriptions to the weapons he made, and they may have been copied inaccurately from a manuscript text.|$|E

500|$|How {{the work}} was {{obtained}} and for <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> is also a factor. If {{the work was}} obtained illegally or unethically, the dealing {{is less likely to}} be [...] "fair" [...] than if it was legitimately acquired. Similarly, if the motives of the dealing are negative, the fairness will be impugned. As in Hyde Park, the court must [...] "judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner" [...] in question. Consequences are also a factor; if, as in Hubbard v Vosper, the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original, this will limit the fairness of the dealing. Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way, as in Hyde Park.|$|E

2500|$|This {{conflict}} {{raised the}} important question {{of what happens when}} an Act of Congress conflicts with the Constitution. Marshall answered that Acts of Congress that conflict with the Constitution are not law and the Courts are bound instead to follow the Constitution, affirming the principle of judicial review. In support of this position Marshall looked {{to the nature of the}} written Constitution‚Äîthere would be no point of having a written Constitution if the courts could just ignore it. [...] "To <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> are powers limited, and to <b>what</b> <b>purpose</b> is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained?" [...] Marshall also argued that the very nature of the judicial function requires courts to make this determination. Since it is a court's duty to decide cases, courts have to be able to decide what law applies to each case. Therefore, if two laws conflict with each other, a court must decide which law applies. Finally, Marshall pointed to the judge's oath requiring them to uphold the Constitution, and to the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which lists the [...] "Constitution" [...] before the [...] "laws of the United States". Part of the core of this reasoning is found in the following statements from the decision: ...|$|E
