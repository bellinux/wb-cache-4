5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E
25|$|One thing Wozniak <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> teach {{elementary}} school {{because of the}} important role teachers play in students' lives. Eventually, he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades and teachers as well.|$|E
25|$|Young Schoendoerffer had {{realized}} he was not born to be a mariner, {{but he did not}} want to be a soldier either, thinking he would be wasting his time. What he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> filmmaking. As he failed to enter the television and cinema industries, he began photography instead. One day as he read a Le Figaro article about war cameraman Georges Kowal, Killed in action during the First Indochina War, he decided to try his luck in the Service Cinématographique des Armées ("Armies' Cinematographic Service", SCA, now ECPAD).|$|E

25|$|What {{has been}} lost beneath the clouds of myths {{surrounding}} this situation {{is the reason why}} many clubs were cautious about wholeheartedly supporting the road-racing movement. Remember that it was wartime and the younger membership of most clubs was away engaged in a war. The older members left at home did not wish to risk damaging a sport which all had enjoyed, so they decided {{to maintain the status quo}} until the war ended. The rank and file of the NCU/RTTC membership was not anti-BLRC - all it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> preserve the sport until the service men returned to civvy street.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} these {{questions}} may be sufficiently answered through {{the study of}} formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also {{run the risk of}} inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over {{whether or not they are}} sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.|$|E
500|$|With Watchmen, Alan Moore's {{intention}} was to create four or five [...] "radically opposing ways" [...] to perceive {{the world and to}} give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible. Moore did not believe in the notion of [...] " [...] regurgitated morals" [...] down the readers' throats and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light. Moore said, [...] "What we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> show all of these people, warts and all. Show that even the worst of them had something going for them, and even the best of them had their flaws." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the album, and its title track, is a {{reference}} to Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. According to Hartman, it [...] "is an intriguing look at the internal battle between right and wrong. It's about the fighting that goes on inside of us. It's like when Paul said, 'The things I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>are</b> the things I don't do, and the things I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>are</b> the things that I do.'" ...|$|R
500|$|Knowing that Liz {{will not}} break off with Danny, Jack tells Danny {{he knows about}} the two. He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz, hoping that Danny [...] will end it with Liz, which he does. After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that all he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to be a father}} figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz had been looking for her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he thinks he can.|$|E
500|$|Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who {{initially}} positively identified Till's body {{and stated that}} the case against Milam and Bryant was [...] "pretty good", on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last thing I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, [...] "Oh Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as power pop. Its musical style is reminiscent of the band's early albums Dookie (1994) and Nimrod (1997). It is a [...] "move away" [...] from the band's politically inspired releases like American Idiot (2004) and 21st Century Breakdown (2009). Bassist Mike Dirnt described the musical style of [...] "Oh Love" [...] by stating, [...] "We were just thinking about making a killer power-pop record– dirtier, back to basics. We tapped into our version of Exile on Main Street". Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong also talked about his desire to write a power pop song, stating, [...] "What I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> write real power-pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy, so the original Green Day sound became ¡Uno!".|$|E

500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> {{to make sure it was}} quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{missed his}} second season due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered 20 minutes into the Chargers' first training camp workout on July 23, 1999. Leaf had surgery to fix a labral tear in his throwing shoulder. During an August training camp, a fan heckled Leaf: [...] "Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star." [...] Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying [...] "No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it." [...] Leaf later explained the incident: [...] "...what I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to understand why you would say that about me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Kelly, in his 1997 {{biography}} of Shankly, calls him [...] "the ultimate obsessive". Shankly was fanatical about Liverpool and about football in general. From coaching his players and arguing with journalists to buttonholing fans in pubs, all Shankly [...] "ever <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> talk about football" [...] {{and to be}} involved in football. As a result, he had few interests outside the game other than his family. His wife Nessie told Kelly that Shankly would spend time in the garden, mowing and weeding. She could also rely on him to [...] "clean the cooker when Liverpool lost". Family holidays were limited to a week in Blackpool, where they always stayed at the Norbreck Hotel. One non-football activity that Shankly did enjoy was playing cards and Ian St John said he [...] "loved" [...] it, always taking part on long coach trips to away matches.|$|E

5000|$|Sandeep Sachdev as Sadiq Khan is classy and cocky. He is {{the actor}} who {{everybody}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> make films with and everybody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be around. Sadiq however, is not all talk - and all he really <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> be someone {{more than just a}} star in a baseless film. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>doing</b> meaningful films.|$|R
500|$|While Auerbach was {{not known}} for his {{tactical}} bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays, he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed trash talk. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history. Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers' role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6'10" [...] 260-pound Moses Malone. Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. Earl Lloyd, the first black player {{to play in the}} NBA, said: [...] "Red Auerbach convinced his players that he loved them [...] so all they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> please him." ...|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki was {{inspired}} to create The Wind Rises after reading a quote from Horikoshi: [...] "All I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to make something beautiful". Several scenes in The Wind Rises were inspired by Tatsuo Hori's novel , in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fiancée before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character's name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori's novel [...] The Wind Rises continues to reflect Miyazaki's pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not {{the intention of the}} film. The film premiered on July 20, 2013, and received critical acclaim; it was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Prize, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was also commercially successful, grossing ¥11.6 billion (US$110 million) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

500|$|The cold winters drove Marquis to {{consider}} yet another change of career (Whitehall {{is at an}} elevation of 4360ft); he applied to the United States Veteran's Bureau. Meanwhile, he continued writing. He expanded his Indian diary into {{a book on the}} Cheyenne; he also wrote short stories and an article on [...] "Reviewing the Story of Custer's Last Battle", the first of his many publications on this subject. In April 1923, he moved to Alberton, where he continued to practice medicine, and published a short story [...] "Buffalo Heart, Indian Policeman", printed in The Youth's Companion, a leading literary magazine. In June, this success, and the better climate in Alberton, led him to turn down a job offer from the Veteran's Bureau and put most of his effort into work on his Cheyenne book. In May 1924 he had a second story, [...] "The Guest of the Tribe", published in The Youth's Companion. However, Marquis was never really comfortable writing fiction. What he really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to write non-fiction about the Custer battle, and to do that he needed to be nearer to the scene. The opportunity came in June 1925 when the agency physician for the Crow Reservation suggested to him that there was room for another physician to set up practice there. In August, he set up a medical practice in Lodge Grass on the Crow Reservation.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} inspirations of the record came from her father's Christmas album The Magic of Christmas (1960). Cole called the album one of [...] "the nicest, warmest Christmas [...] albums that I've heard". She {{described}} the original version of the 1945 track [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] as [...] "a darling sweet song" [...] {{that has yet to}} be imitated by other original Christmas songs. In an interview with NPR, Cole said in the beginning of her career, [...] "the last thing [...] <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> sing [...] dad's music" [...] and that [...] "it took 15 years into [...] career before [...] felt comfortable and confident enough to even attempt at singing my father's music". The album includes three cover version of her father's songs; [...] "Caroling, Caroling", [...] "The First Noel", and [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] done in tribute to him. Waldron said the album was [...] "keeping the holiday spirit in the family". Cole would later re-record [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] as a posthumous duet with her father on her 1999 Christmas album The Magic of Christmas. The song also appears on Cole's 2008 Christmas album (...) and her 1995 collaborative Christmas live album with Plácido Domingo and José Carreras (A Celebration of Christmas).|$|E
