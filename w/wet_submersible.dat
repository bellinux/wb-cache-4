50|$|The UDTs pioneered combat swimming, closed-circuit diving, {{underwater}} demolitions, and {{midget submarine}} (dry and <b>wet</b> <b>submersible)</b> operations. They were the {{precursor to the}} present-day United States Navy SEALs.|$|E
50|$|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams' {{historical}} roots began during WWII {{with the}} earliest human torpedoes to see use: Maiale, used by Italy's Decima Flottiglia MAS, and Chariots, used by British commando frogmen. Naval Special Warfare entered the <b>wet</b> <b>submersible</b> {{field in the}} 1960s when the Coastal Systems Center in Panama City, FL developed the Mark 7, a free-flooding SDV of the type used today, and the first SDV {{to be used in}} the fleet. The Mark 8 and 9 followed in the late 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Six 4 -hr., open-sea test {{trials were}} {{conducted}} with a <b>wet</b> <b>submersible.</b> The purpose of these trials {{was to assess the}} effects of long exposure to cold (16. 5 ” C) water on man’s ability t o perform basic submersible control tasks. The subjects were experienced submersible pilots who had a minimum of 20 hours training prior to the experimental trials. Skin and rectal temperatures were continuously recorded from both the pilot and rider of the submersible. A continuous record of vehicle depth and water temperature was also obtained. The pilot’s task was to muintoin a prescribed depth while performing a sequence of course changes for a 4 -hr. period of submergence. Depth error variance was correlated with pilot core and skin tempemture changes over time, and although pilot core temperature fell as much as 1. 83 ” C, no degradation in depth control performance wns apparent...|$|E
50|$|As an early, {{experimental}} submersible bridge, the Gairloch Bridge {{is important}} in demonstrating the evolution of bridge design in Queensland and exemplifies how the colonial authorities responsible for bridge building responded to the extreme conditions of the north Queensland <b>wet</b> season. <b>Submersible</b> bridges evolved as a cost-effective {{solution to the problem}} of bridging rivers that were seasonally subject to extreme flooding, and remain common in Queensland.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{introduces}} {{a kind of}} horizontal <b>wet</b> electric <b>submersible</b> pump unit with both submersible and non-submersible operational models that could be installed permanently. Then, it analyses the structural features, operating principles, main component performance and rotor system. A series of technical advantages show {{that this kind of}} submersible pump has a bright application prospect in conventional drainage and disaster-resistant emergency drainage of deep mines...|$|R
50|$|The thermal module (Therm) {{combines}} {{lumped circuit}} and finite element thermal calculations for optimising the cooling {{system of the}} machine. Cooling methods modelled include natural convection (Totally enclosed non ventilated - TENV), forced convection (Totally enclosed fan cooled - TEFC), through ventilation, water jackets, <b>submersible,</b> <b>wet</b> rotor and wet stator, spray cooling, radiation and conduction.A wide range of housing types can be modelled.|$|R
