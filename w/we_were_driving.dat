500|$|The title {{refers to}} the rabbits' destination, Watership Down, a hill {{in the north of}} Hampshire, England, near the area where Adams grew up. The story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamond during long car journeys. As he {{explained}} in 2007, he [...] "began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised {{off the top of my}} head, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> along." [...] The daughters insisted he write it down—"they were very, very persistent". After some delay he began writing in the evenings and completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.|$|E

The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E

500|$|MSR Studios was {{the final}} New York City-based studio used, and where most of 4 was {{recorded}}—only [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "I Was Here" [...] were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as [...] "I Care" [...] and [...] "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write and record [...] "I Miss You" [...] at MSR, saying to Complex, [...] " [...] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record." ...|$|E

[...] In this way, Ocean ended up co-writing [...] "I Miss You". Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyoncé's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote. On June 18, 2011, [...] "I Miss You"" [...] was the third song to be chosen. The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like [...] "I Miss You": ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a {{relatively}} unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, {{it was noted that}} Ocean had become the [...] "go-to vocal hook man." [...] The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". Singer Beyoncé Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write [...] "I Miss You" [...] for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; [...] "Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> to Brooklyn.

500|$|... "Three Little Birds" [...] {{taken from}} Over the Rainbow, was {{released}} as Talbot's first single on 10 June 2008 in the UK, {{and was released}} alongside the album in the US on 14 October. Bedi, writing for the Malaysian newspaper The Star, said that [...] "Three Little Birds" [...] was her favourite song on Over the Rainbow. The single peaked at number 3 on the Independent Singles Charts in the United Kingdom, and entered the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart at number 2, dropping to 3 the next week. It then raised back to number 2, and, on the sixth week, reached number 1. Talbot received attention from the British press because of the single's success, with the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph attributing her success in America to her appeal to the Christian market, and {{to the success of}} her videos on YouTube. Talbot's father, Gavin, spoke about the song reaching number one, saying [...] "When we received the phone call <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> back from doing a round of radio interviews in London and Connie was asleep {{in the back of the}} car. When we told her she just took it in her stride. I just cannot believe that she is number one in America. We are all very proud of her. It is a big achievement – people have just taken a shine to her." [...] He also said it was [...] "a big shock to hear she was number one. It is tremendous." [...] As of November 2008, the single has sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide.|$|E

Our large-scale operations have attempted to enable the development of a protective shield, by driving the NVA and the Viet Cong main force units out of South Vietnam—or at least into the remote mountain and jungle areas where they would not pose a threat to the population.

The actual top speed of the least powerful Hillman Hunter in 1975 was 83mph and the top speed of a 70s-era taxi was 60mph. According to Purnell: [...] "There was no chase.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that visual attention is guided to potentially informative locations in two main ways. First, {{as can be}} experienced in our daily activity, deployment of attentional focus is subject to endogenous control. For example, when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>driving</b> a car, attentional focus can be allocated endogenously to a particular object, such as a traffic sign or a truck immediately ahead. At the same time, the attentional focus can be captured exogenously by abrupt changes in the visual field, such as the sudden ap-pearance of a motorcycle from behind the truck. These two ways have been investigated in the literature, respectively, as top-down or goal-directed control, and bottom-up or stimulus-driven control of attentional focus (e. g., Egeth &...|$|R
