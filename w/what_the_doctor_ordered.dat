5000|$|In 1979, Yamaha {{followed}} the growing trend of offering a [...] "factory custom" [...] {{version of the}} bike, called a [...] "Special" [...] by Yamaha. Pullback handlebars, a stepped seat, a smaller, fatter rear wheel, a smaller capacity tear-drop gas tank, fully adjustable suspension, and altered frame created a factory custom, forerunner of the modern cruiser. The XS Eleven Special sold well despite complaints about the poor ergonomics. [...] "What that translates to is a bike with an awkward riding position but generally excellent road manners. In fact, {{most of the things}} that irritated this staff in the way the bike rode and handled could be traced to the handlebar, which, although certainly as trendy as disco dancing, was not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ergonomics <b>doctor</b> <b>ordered</b> for precise, comfortable control." ...|$|R
5000|$|Specifying in a four star {{review by}} CCM Magazine, Andy Argyrakis realizes, [...] "Hard rock never sounded sweeter... theres mounds of melodic {{sensibility}} at every turn, alongside positive messages spanning several facets of love to the undeniably divine." [...] Bert Gangl, indicating in a four star review at Jesus Freak Hideout, recognizes, [...] "Impressive {{though it may}} be, Only To Rise isnt completely devoid of drawbacks. As probing and sincere as the majority of Sweets lyrics are, {{a small portion of}} them find the ever-passionate front man employing language that is either awkward or overused... And even though it hardly seems destined to convince legions of dyed-in-the-wool pop or alt-rock lovers to wipe their mp3 players clean and start from scratch, fans of Sweet and Lynchs previous band-based work, those who appreciate powerhouse vocals and consummate guitar work - or, really, anyone who wants to pretend the 90s never happened - will undoubtedly discover that Only To Rise is just <b>what</b> <b>the</b> good <b>doctor</b> <b>ordered.</b> [...] " [...] In a four out of five review, The Phantom Tollbooths Bert Saraco, responds, [...] "Only To Rise is sweet indeed - a collaboration by musicians that are masters at what they do, and what they do is produce heavy rock and roll with one foot in the here-and-now and the other foot on a stage somewhere in the heart of classic rock." [...] Signaling in a nine out of ten review from Cross Rhythms, Rob Birtley replies, [...] "Throughout Sweets Christian sensibilities shine through in the lyrics and the unlikely union with Lynch, whose nickname is Scary, is a thorough success." [...] Jay Heilman, rating the album 3.5 out of five for Christian Music Review, writes, [...] "Only To Rise was a great album and it was great to see Sweet away from STRYPER for a project." [...] Writing a review for Christian Review Magazine, Christian St. John rating the album five stars, states, [...] "honestly, each and every track on Only To Rise is excellent".|$|R

60|$|However, {{these were}} small matters. No doubt {{she had been}} in a hurry and all that sort of thing. The {{important}} point was {{that he was going to}} see her. When a man's afraid, sings the bard, a beautiful maid is a cheering sight to see; and the same truth holds good when a man has made an exhibition of himself at a ship's concert. A woman's gentle sympathy, that was what Samuel Marlowe wanted more than anything else at the moment. That, he felt, was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>ordered.</b> He scrubbed the burnt cork off his face with all possible speed and changed his clothes and made his way to the upper deck. It was like Billie, he felt, to have chosen this spot for their meeting. It would be deserted and it was hallowed for them both by sacred associations.|$|E

Bud Smithers is the guy to handle that kid. You ought to see him take hold of a dog that's all grouch and ugliness and make it over into a dog that it's a pleasure to have around. I thought a few weeks with Bud was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>ordered</b> for Ogden, and Miss Ann guessed I was right, so we had it all framed. And now this happens and balls everything up! She can't do nothing with a husky kid like that without me to help her. And how am I going to help her if I'm not allowed in the house?" ...|$|E
60|$|The more I {{looked at}} it in that way, the sounder this prison wheeze seemed to me. There {{was no doubt in}} the world that prison was just <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>ordered</b> for Motty. It {{was the only thing that}} could have pulled him up. I was sorry for the poor blighter, but, after all, I reflected, a chappie who had lived all his life with Lady Malvern, in a small village in the {{interior}} of Shropshire, wouldn't have much to kick at in a prison. Altogether, I began to feel absolutely braced again. Life became like what the poet Johnnie says--one grand, sweet song. Things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that I give you my word that I'd almost forgotten such a person as Motty existed. The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves was still pained and distant. It wasn't anything he said or did, mind you, but there was a rummy something about him all the time. Once when I was tying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass. There was a kind of grieved look in his eye.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To prevent {{medical errors}} or even accidents, our {{solution}} is to design the closed-loop application based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in the Hospital Information System (HIS). We focus on the information improvement for <b>doctor's</b> <b>order</b> based on RFID. The whole closed-loop process starts from the initial collection of the patient's information, through confirmation of the unique identification of the patient, and to the finishing of <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> <b>order</b> at last. <b>The</b> final information is written back into HIS. Medical staff can collect {{and deal with the}} patient's information straightly through the system, thereby guarantee maximal medical information correctness. The system design of the closed-loop process of <b>the</b> <b>doctor’s</b> <b>order</b> includes new workflow and its wireless system architecture based on RFID in the ward environment...|$|R
