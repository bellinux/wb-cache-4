However the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by Pedro Reinel in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by Diogo Cão.

25|$|At dawn on {{the next}} day, Loredan sent two galleys, bearing the Banner of Saint Mark, to the entry of the port of Gallipoli to open negotiations. In {{response}} the Turks sent 32 ships to attack them. Loredan withdrew his two galleys, and began to withdraw, while shooting at the Turkish ships, in order to lure them away from Gallipoli. As the Ottoman ships could {{not keep up with}} their oars, they set sail; on the Venetian side, the galley from Napoli di Romania tarried during the manoeuvre and was in danger of being caught by the pursuing Ottoman ships, so that Loredan likewise ordered his ships to set sail. Once they were had made ready for combat, Loredan ordered his ten galleys to lower sails, turn about, and face the Ottoman fleet. At that point, however, the eastern <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> suddenly, and allowed the Ottomans to break off the pursuit and head back to Gallipoli. Loredan in turn tried {{to catch up with the}} Ottomans, firing at them with his guns and crossbows and launching grappling hooks at the Turkish ships, but the wind and the current allowed the Ottomans to retreat speedily behind the fortifications of Gallipoli. According to Loredan, the engagement lasted until the 22nd hour.|$|E
500|$|A <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> is {{a graphic}} tool used by meteorologists {{to give a}} succinct view of how wind speed and {{direction}} are typically distributed at a particular location. [...] Presented in a polar coordinate grid, the <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions. [...] The length of each spoke around the circle {{is related to the}} frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction per unit time. [...] Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, emanating from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles. A <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind direction ranges. [...] Wind roses typically use 8 or 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions.|$|E

500|$|In {{the other}} boats, {{there was nothing}} the {{survivors}} could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold {{and several of the}} boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had no lights. The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by [...] "the utter helplessness of our position." [...] Some swimmers who had reached collapsible A had not enough strength to come aboard, and had to cling to the boat's sides. The bodies {{of the majority of the}} people who died during the night were lowered into the sea to make more room for the survivors.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{views on}} how Yue died. According to The History of China: (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations) and other sources, Yue died in prison.

It reads, [...] "... strode in long steps to the Pavilion of Winds and Waves ... The warders on both sides picked up the ropes and strangled the three men [...] without further ado ... At the time Lord Yue was 39 years of age and the young lord Yue Yun 23. When the three men returned to Heaven, suddenly a fierce <b>wind</b> <b>rose</b> up wildly and all the fires and lights were extinguished.

40|$|Mesoscale flow {{characteristics}} in the Alpine region are deduced from {{a set of}} daily large-scale analyses (1981 - 1990) by means of statistical-dynamical downscaling. This method utilizes {{the results of a}} large number of mesoscale numerical simulations in combination with known statistics of the forcing large-scale conditions. The investigation is restricted to cross-Alpine large-scale flow from 165 to 265 degree at 500 hPa. Such types of flow are favourable to south foehn. The results provide model-based climatological estimates of surface <b>wind</b> <b>roses,</b> gravity-wave potential, and wave-breaking occurrence in 20 and 10 km resolution. Simulated surface <b>wind</b> <b>roses</b> are in sufficient agreement with observations and show a dominance of low-level flow around the Alps with bimodal frequency distributions of wind direction north and south of the mountains. The areas where splitted flows preferably merge were identified. Gravity waves and wave breaking are most likely above the western parts of the Alps. A secondary maximum of likelihood was found above Tyrol and Trentino. Surface <b>wind</b> <b>roses</b> and gravity-wave potential were both checked with respect to their sensitivity to season (spring vs. autumn) and largescale flow direction (south to southwest vs. southwest to west).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Wind</b> <b>roses</b> {{for three}} onshore-offshore {{profiles}} at the Eastern Adriatic coast (Croatia) are considered. The profiles are following: 1) the Northeast Senj – Rab – Mali Lošinj, 2) middle Adriatic profile Split Marjan – Hvar – Komiža and 3) the Southern Adriatic profile Dubrovnik – Lastovo – Palagruža. Time series of instantaneous (at 07 h, 14 h and 21 h of local time) wind data for period 1981 – 1998 have been used. <b>Wind</b> <b>roses</b> strongly depends on spatial wind pattern i. e. wind type. Thus for the sea breeze conditions the winds form SW quadrant prevails for most considered weather stations, while Ethesians (from NW quadrant) wind prevails at Palagruža and Lastovo islands. During jugo (or sirocco), wind directions are concentrated on SE quadrant. An exception is Senj station where canalising jugo wind is not stressed. During bura (or bora) conditions, {{concentration of the}} wind directions is located into NE quadrant. Only one direction is very dominant at coastal locations...|$|R

40|$|Wind data {{measured}} at three off-shore {{stations in the}} northern part of the Adriatic Sea were considered: the Coastal oceanographic station Piran buoy (COSP), the PALOMA tower (the Gulf of Trieste) and the A. ALTA platform (Venice). Annual <b>wind</b> <b>roses</b> for all stations and additional seasonal <b>wind</b> <b>roses</b> for COSP are presented. The Weibull distribution function was applied to wind speed frequency distribution for winds from all directions and separately for bora and sirocco winds. Wind speed frequency distributions for bora winds measured at COSP and PALOMA are bimodal. One peak of this distribution of speeds belongs to nocturnal land breezes and another to bora winds. The peak separation method based on the difference in potential temperature of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) between two land stations (Udine and Zagreb) enabled the successful separation of the peaks of bora and land breeze winds. The frequency distribution of the wind speeds changed to the usual unimodal distribution when only those episodes were considered in which the potential temperature of ABL above Udine is higher than that above Zagreb...|$|R
