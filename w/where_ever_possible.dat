While in Paris, Grant thought the various paintings portraying Napoleon's battles were distasteful. Julia, however, {{did not share}} Grant's harsh opinion of the deceased Emperor. Relations were further strained because minister Elihu Washburne during the recent Franco-Prussian War once protected German diplomats, a position that was supported by Grant when president. Given the overall situation, Grant was received coldly by Victor Hugo, whose father was once a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army. At other times Grant was treated with polite indifference by various French military officials in Paris. [...] Grant's dislike for Napoleon would become an issue, prompting Young to steer Grant away from possible trouble <b>where</b> <b>ever</b> <b>possible.</b> Young suggested that {{as an act of}} good faith they visit Napoleon's tomb, but upon coming to the scene Grant turned away. After the various and potentially unpleasant encounters with French dignitaries in Paris, Grant {{turned his attention to the}} ordinary class in French society.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{approximation}} scheme with potential application {{to a general}} interacting quantum system is presented. The method is nonperturbative, self- consistent, systematically improvable and uniformly applicable for arbitrary strength of interaction. It thus overcomes the various limitations of the exsting methods such as the perturbation theory, the variational method, the WKBJ method and other approximation schemes. The current method has been successfully applied {{to a variety of}} interacting systems including the anharmonic / double-well oscillators (with quartic-, sexticand octic couplings) and the scalar field theory with quartic-coupling in the symmetric phase. The method yields important insight in to the structure and stability of the interacting-vacuum of the theory. The results are in good agreement with the exact predictions of supersymmetry <b>where</b> <b>ever</b> applicable. <b>Possible</b> further applications in the areas of quantum statistics, finite temperature field theory, condensed matter physics etc are also discussed. *Ph.

An inquiry recommended that new workshops should be built in the Rockhampton and Townsville areas, and that a new workshop should be built in south-eastern Queensland for locomotive construction and repair, leaving North Ipswich Workshops to cater for carriages and wagons. It was also decided that future rolling stock would be steel <b>where</b> <b>ever</b> <b>possible,</b> a decision which reduced the need for large sawmills at the North Ipswich Railway Workshops.|$|E

The Secretary of War sought advice on who could act on their behalf and the name of Marcellus Hartley was put forward.

For the purpose of his mission he was appointed to a status the equivalent of a brigadier-general and given access to an account at Baring Brothers.

50|$|Animals {{are either}} {{brought in by}} members of the public or picked up by one of their many {{volunteer}} response drivers who are located across the South West. Receptionists at Secret World are on hand from 8 am to 8 pm, where they answer calls to help analyse the situation, with animal carers nearby to help give any advice when needed. Once an animal is brought in it will be assessed and veterinary care is given if needed. Whilst there the animal will continue to be looked after with volunteers and workers giving 24 hour care, giving them their hourly feeds or whatever the animal may require. On site they have extensive facilities, with hospital rooms, and treatment and recovery areas which help in giving all casualties the best possible chance in recovery. During the rehabilitation process, every effort is made {{to reduce the risk of}} imprinting, by reducing human interaction and contact <b>where</b> <b>ever</b> <b>possible.</b> After the rehabilitation process the next stage is for the animal to be released, and they make sure they are 100% recovered and ready before being released. They aim to release the animals where they were found, in a hope to be reunited with their families and homes however this is not always possible. Potential sites are surveyed and vetted for suitability. They specialize in 'soft-releases', enclosures that are set up where the animals are to be released. Here the animal will stay for a few weeks, still without human contact, getting used to the environment and overall settling in, before the gates are opened and they are free to live their lives in the wild. Many animals are also monitored after release.|$|E

50|$|Khetri Mahal {{is located}} behind {{a series of}} lanes. It is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} perfect examples of Shekhawati art and architecture. It is primarily known for its exquisite arrays of paintings and murals mainly supporting the Raghunath temple and Bhopalgarh fort. The uniqueness lies in the continuous flow of wind which invariably makes this structure stand apart from many other such buildings.Pillars have replaced the giant wall structures <b>where</b> <b>ever</b> <b>possible</b> in order to maintain the steady flow of gusting wind in the palace. One can notice the long ramp leading to the vast terrace of the Mahal from the entrance.This was specifically designed to provide ease to Rajputs in riding their horses. In fact the various levels of the Palace are combined with terrace through a series of such ramps. Another objective of these ramps was to provide high enough platform for ‘Thakurs’ to gaze down at their subjects without much effort. The view from the rooftop is particularly worth observing.You can also discover two small alcoves with the fragments of lost era paintings in the private chamber of Thakurs. Most of these paintings were in natural earth pigments. Inside of Khetri Mahal, one can explore huge graceful halls with intricately designed arches and pillars. The most amazing discovery you can make in Khetri Mahal is that it has no doors or windows quite unlike other Mahals.Most of the rooms instead are connected through each other by a well designed series of arches and columns. These arches and columns provide a beautiful symmetrical view to the Palace. The age old lime plaster has been left to its own glory and has a rosy shine in it.Though Khetri Mahal no doubt is one of the rare and unique structures of the Shekhawati era, but the forlorn state of this building is an unfortunate reality. The Palace state as of now certainly requires some immediate attention from the authorities. Such architecture is rare and soon fading, the upkeep and preservation of these unique structure and murals can surely be a huge boost to our Indian tourism and culture.|$|E
