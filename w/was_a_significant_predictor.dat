50|$|Hsieh et al., in Taiwan, {{analysed}} 46,007 {{ischaemic stroke}} admissions.

But this association did not persist after adjustment for stroke severity (OR = 1.07; 95% CI 0.95-1.20). Whereas, Ansa et al., in Nigeria in 2016, studied 339 patients, of which 187 (55.2%) had had a stroke.

50|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} assessing whether certain personality characteristics can lead to depression, among them self-criticism. In one study self-criticism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of depression in medical students, who go through extreme stress during and after medical school. Controlling for initial symptoms, self-criticism was a stronger predictor than even previous depression status both 2 years and 10 years after the initial assessment. In a sample with a history of depression, Mongrain and Leather (2006) found that measures of self-criticism were associated with the number of past episodes of depression. The personality was indicative of depression history, but self-criticism in an interaction with immature dependence was able to predict future episodes of depression as well.|$|E
5000|$|In their analysis, Rubin et al. {{performed}} a regression analysis {{to determine the}} relative importance of each of the second-grade social categories in predicting [...] "externalising" [...] outcomes (such as delinquency and substance abuse) and [...] "internalising" [...] outcomes (insecurity, loneliness and low self-regard). Aggression was found to be the only significant predictor of ninth-grade delinquency, while social withdrawal <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of negative self-regard, loneliness, and felt peer group insecurity. Aggression thus predicted only externalising outcomes, and withdrawal only internalising outcomes. No significant interaction was found between the two forms of unpopularity, suggesting that relatively [...] "pure" [...] samples of aggressive and withdrawn children had indeed been isolated. Social competence, meanwhile, was predictive of substance use (and of felt peer-group insecurity, though to a lesser extent than withdrawal). The researchers conjectured that this externalising outcome might be indicative of natural experimentation rather than unchecked abuse of drugs (which might indeed be associated with peer rejection).|$|E

Participants listened to descriptions of two fictitious groups of Pacific Islanders, one of which was described as being higher in status than the other. In a second study, subjects rated actual groups [...] - [...] the poor and wealthy, women and men [...] - [...] in the United States in terms of their competence. Subjects who scored high on the measure of correspondence bias stereotyped the poor, women, and the fictitious lower-status Pacific Islanders as incompetent whereas they stereotyped the wealthy, men, and the high-status Pacific Islanders as competent. The correspondence bias <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of stereotyping even after controlling for other measures that have been linked to beliefs about low status groups, the just-world hypothesis and social dominance orientation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{cross-cultural}} research using the CSES, Crocker Luhtanen, Blaine, and Broadnax explored the nature of collective self-esteem in Asian, Black, and White college students. Crocker et al. found that collective self-esteem <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of psychological adjustment and that among the Black students in their sample, the correlation {{between public and private}} collective self-esteem was essentially zero. Based on this later finding, Crocker et al. surmised that Black college students might separate how they privately feel about their group from how they believe others may evaluate them. This separation between public and private evaluations may represent an important survival strategy for Black Americans because of the prejudice and discrimination they face in the United States. The literature has suggested that Black Americans may generally feel good about their own racial group but still believe that external perceptions of their racial group may be negative or derogatory. This phenomenon might indicate a CSES factor structure for Black Americans that is different from that of other racial or ethnic groups in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Goff and Ackerman {{found that}} TIE was {{moderately}} associated with crystallized intelligence (r = [...]33) and weakly associated with fluid intelligence (r = [...]11). Goff and Ackerman {{suggested that the}} relationship between TIE and crystallized intelligence might reflect an overlap between the constructs (as crystallized intelligence involves acquired knowledge), or it might reflect an influence of crystallized intelligence on TIE, or a symbiotic relationship between the two. TIE had strong positive correlations with measures of academic interests (e.g. interest in arts and humanities, science, social science but not interest in technology) and with a measure of academic comfort. A study examining predictors of general knowledge found that TIE had a significant positive association with a measure of general knowledge (r = [...]36). However, the relationship between TIE and general knowledge became non-significant when differences in intelligence were taken into account. A meta-analysis found that TIE <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of academic performance (r = [...]33). The authors of this study suggested that intellectual curiosity, as measured by TIE, is a potential [...] "third pillar" [...] of academic achievement, the other two pillars being intelligence and effort.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{settings}} that effortlessly engage our attention are {{typically associated with}} soft fascination and with the analysis of tranquillity and preference published by Herzog and Bosely (1992). In this study, the authors attempted to distinguish empirically between the constructs of tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Motivated by ART, from which they took tranquillity as a reasonable term to describe soft fascination, they produced definitions for each component. Tranquillity they defined as “how much you think this setting is a quiet, peaceful place, {{a good place to}} get away from everyday life”, and preference as “how much you like this setting for whatever reason”.Subjects were asked to score the following visual settings: mountains, deserts, fields / forests and waterscapes against the two target variables, tranquillity and preference, and four descriptor variables: mistiness, unstructured openness, focus and surface calmness. Tranquillity and preference were positively correlated across all settings with tranquillity scoring higher ratings in the field / forest, waterscape and mountain categories, whilst rushing water had the highest rating in the preference category.Analysis of the results identified three physical features that help explain the apparent split between tranquillity and preference. These were; mistiness, unstructured openness; which refers to how open the scene is and {{how difficult it is to}} establish a sense of depth or distance, and surface calmness. Mistiness and unstructured openness tended to depress preference relative to tranquillity whilst surface calmness tended to enhance it. Herzog and Barnes conducted a follow up study in which deserts and waterscapes were included in the setting types. In 2000, Herzog and Chernick conducted further research into the tranquillity construct when they investigated the relationship between tranquillity and danger in urban and rural settings.The key results that emerged from this research were that ‘setting care’, which relates to how safe we feel in a particular setting, is more salient for judgments of danger in urban settings than natural ones and that openness <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of danger but not of tranquillity. The authors concluded therefore that tranquillity and danger should not simply be viewed as polar opposites, but like preference and tranquillity as distinct constructs.|$|E

40|$|SummaryInflammatory bowel disease {{patients}} have impaired {{quality of life}} with physical, social and emotional dysfunction. This project aimed to assess the effects of socio-demographic and clinical variables on {{quality of life and}} to identify its predictors. In a cross-sectional paper-based study, 50 consecutive non-selected patients attending the teaching hospital completed a disease-specific McMaster quality of life tool. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from patients’ records. The t-test and Mann–Whitney test were used to determine the probability of significant differences between quality of life domains and independent variables. Multiple linear regression was used to determine quality of life predictors. Younger and highly educated patients had higher social scores. Those with shorter disease durations had higher systemic scores. Patients in remission had higher systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Relapse <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of decreased systemic, social, bowel and overall scores. Long disease duration <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of decreased systemic and overall scores.

40|$|The {{psychological}} and physical well-being of students <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cause for concern. For {{the majority of the}} student population this means substantial changes in healthy behaviours including eating habits. The current research was aimed at investigating integrative eating in 170 Australian university students. Self-awareness and health locus of control were measured in order to assess their relative impact on positive integrative eating practices. The self-report measures included Your Personal Eating Style Profile, Forms A and B of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the Situational Self-Awareness Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided tentative support for the hypothesis that an internal locus of control <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of integrative eating total, as opposed to beliefs in powerful others and chance, which were not found to be significant. Private self-awareness was found to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of integrative eating total, after controlling for age, gender, social desirability and health locus of control. An unexpected finding was that awareness of surroundings was also found to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>predictor</b> of positive integrative eating. No significant interaction was identified between self-reported private self-awareness and self-reported internal locus of control.
