5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little <b>weather</b> <b>protection,</b> and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with <b>weather</b> <b>protection</b> and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E

25|$|Vespa's largest {{market by}} all {{measures}} globally is still Italy, {{but as a}} result of the mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the ]] is still Vespa's second largest global market—and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the <b>weather</b> <b>protection.</b> Their counterparts, the rockers rode classic British motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various racks and crash bars. A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies.|$|E

50|$|While wearing fur {{clothing}} in cold <b>weather</b> as <b>protection</b> {{goes back to}} the Stone Age, the source for this material came from the wild. As human populations grew, furs, leathers, and hides for use in clothing came from farm stock, such as sheep (sheepskin), rabbits, cattle, pigs, and goats. The earliest records of breeding mink for fur in North America were in the 1860s. Foxes were first raised on farms for fur in Prince Edward Island in Canada in 1895.|$|R
25|$|In Venice, {{the second}} and current St. Mark's Basilica {{was built on the}} site of the first between 1063 and 1072, {{replacing}} the earlier church while replicating its Greek cross plan. Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base. These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until after 1204. The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen from a great distance. In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved <b>weather</b> <b>protection.</b> It was a rare practice before the 11th century. The fluted and onion-shaped cupolas of the domes may have been added in the mid-fifteenth century to complement the ogee arches added to the facade in the late Gothic period. Their shape may have been influenced by the open and domed wooden pavilions of Persia or by other eastern models. Initially, only the center dome had one.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1918 {{his term}} {{of service in}} the police force was {{completed}} and he had reached pensionable age. However, the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee asked him to stay on in office, and he did so, until 1944. Around this time Richardson instigated the installation of a Police Out-Station at Kings Cross, Halifax, which was a mini replica of Harrison Road. This, he said, would benefit the police and, just as important, the local population, and set the scene for {{what was to become}} Neighbourhood Policing in the UK many years later. The first Police van for the Halifax Borough Police was purchased in 1920. Richardson supervised the purchase and modifications were made so that it could be used for various other purposes, not least of which was for use by The Coroner's court in Halifax. By 1922 Halifax had many theatres and cinemas. Richardson made and published a booklet regarding the safety of people in 'Queues at Licensed Places of Entertainment' involving their health, <b>weather</b> <b>protection</b> and creating crush room amongst other headings. This followed a tragedy in London when some people died in a cinema fire because the emergency doors opened inwards. Richardson ensured all such doors opened outwards from now on. From 16 January 1924 the Borough was granted the status of a 'Quarter Session town'. This affected procedure and routines for Richardson and his police/court work. From this time he was very active in a Prosecutors role in Court cases. In 1925 he wrote a book called 'The Evolution of the Police Force.' and also wrote a booklet 'Superannuation in the Police Force'.|$|E

A {{standard}} Royal Navy [...] whaler was fitted {{on the port side}} of the funnel in addition to the US-issue ship's boat on the starboard side; additional lifesaving rafts were also fitted: big ones on sloping launch skids aft of the funnel and small ones aft of the searchlights. Wind deflectors were fitted on {{the leading edge of the}} bridge area and a canvas-covered shelter was installed on the quarterdeck to provide better <b>weather</b> <b>protection</b> for depth charge crews. Oiling fairleads were fitted to the edge of the hull by the anchor winch. The bilge keels were lengthened and made deeper (a process that took a minimum of three weeks).|$|E
2500|$|The Triumph Spitfire {{is a small}} British two-seat sports car, {{introduced}} at the London Motor Show in 1962. The vehicle {{was based on a}} design produced for Standard-Triumph in 1957 by Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. The platform for the car was largely based upon the chassis, engine, and running gear of the Triumph Herald saloon, [...] but [...] shortened [...] and [...] minus [...] the Herald's [...] outrigger [...] sections, and was manufactured at the Standard-Triumph works at Canley, in Coventry. Unusually for cars of this era, the bodywork was fitted onto a separate structural chassis, but for the Spitfire, which was designed as an open top or convertible sports car from the outset, the backbone chassis was reinforced for additional rigidity by the use of structural components within the bodywork [...] (the [...] rear [...] trailing arms [...] bolted [...] to [...] the body rather [...] than the chassis). The Spitfire was provided with a manual soft-top for <b>weather</b> <b>protection,</b> the design improving to a folding hood for later models. Factory-manufactured hard-tops were also available.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the grain ship and tanker MACs was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships. [...] The three after holds were converted to provide a hangar [...] long, [...] wide to a height of [...] in which the ship's full complement of four Swordfish aircraft could be stowed with wings folded. [...] An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar to deck level in less than a minute. [...] It was impracticable to fit tanker MACs with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. [...] Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MACs normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: [...] parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible safety barrier was fitted to prevent collisions. [...] Hinged side screens or 'palisades' were fitted around the aft end of the flight deck to provide <b>weather</b> <b>protection</b> for parked aircraft but with only limited effect.|$|E
50|$|Practical reasons include <b>protection</b> {{from bad}} <b>weather</b> and <b>protection</b> against {{industrial}} contamination, {{for example in}} dusty and oily environments. A headscarf can ensure that the hair does {{not interfere with the}} work and get caught-up in machinery since, avoiding long hair can get into rotating parts of machines, either by means of a suitable head covering like a cap, hairnet or kerchief; cutting the hair shot; or by putting on a scarf. Hygiene also requires wearing a head cover, for example in kitchens and hospitals. Such usage has gone on since about 1900, when women 's use of mob caps and Dutch bonnets declined.|$|R

2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of engine vibrations and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. <b>Weather</b> <b>protection</b> was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light.
