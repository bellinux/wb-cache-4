5|$|More specifically, the {{nominate}} subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts {{and throat}} {{with the face}} a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic as {{male and female}} purple-throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage. The male has black upperparts, including the head, wings, and tail. The feathers on the bird's back to its uppertail coverts, {{as well as its}} upperwing coverts, have white fringes. There is also a conspicuous white wingstripe and <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> to the tertial feathers. Additionally the male has a deeply purple throat and a white belly, with some black barring on its rear flanks.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, and darker gills with <b>white</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with <b>white</b> <b>edges,</b> and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E

25|$|Sharpe's lark, M. (a.) sharpii, {{of northwestern}} Somalia, has almost plain, coppery red upper parts and is {{sometimes}} (e.g., by Sibley and Monroe) {{regarded as a}} separate and endangered species. Its small range of some 21,200km2 is impacted by overgrazing and conversion to croplands. It may however be conspecific with Somali lark, M. (a.) somalica, which differs by its very long bill and <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> to the outer tail feathers. The Somali lark is sometimes considered a race of rufous-naped lark, but is alternatively deemed a full species in Mirafra or Certhilauda.|$|E
500|$|T. m. confinis breeds above [...] in the {{highlands}} of southern Baja California. This form is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts. It is relatively small, and the palest subspecies, with uniform pale gray-brown on the head, face and upperparts. It usually lacks any white spots to {{the tips of the}} outer tail feathers, which have <b>white</b> <b>edges.</b> It is sometimes classed as a separate species, the San Lucas robin, but the American Ornithologists' Union regards it as only a subspecies, albeit in a different group from the other races.|$|E
500|$|The spiny {{dorsal fin}} of Murray cod is {{moderate}} to low in height and is partially {{separated by a}} notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. [...] Soft dorsal, anal, and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are dusky grey or black with distinct <b>white</b> <b>edges.</b> The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to the flanks. The pelvic fins are large, angular, and set forward of the pectoral fins. The leading white-coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing white filaments, while the pelvic fins themselves are usually a translucent white or cream, tending toward opacity in large fish.|$|E

500|$|Inocybe praetervisa has a {{bell-shaped}} (later expanding) cap of [...] in diameter, {{which is}} a yellowish-brown colour. It is fibrous, and splits from the margin (which curves inwards) to the centre. The stem is from [...] in height, and from [...] thick. It is white, maturing to a pale straw-yellow, and the whole stem is , meaning it is covered in particles resembling meal. The stem has a distinct bulb at the base, which is moderately , and lacks a ring. The flesh is white, and discolours to yellowish in the stem. The gills are initially whitish, but later become a clay-brown with toothed, <b>white</b> <b>edges.</b> They are adnexed, meaning they connect to the stem by only part of their depth, and are crowded closely together.|$|E

The Madagascan subspecies is overall paler and larger-billed than the nominate form. It has denser streaking on the breast, but only very fine lines on the lower abdomen and on the white undertail. It is distinctly smaller than the nominate subspecies, [...] in length with an average weight of [...] This martin moults in December and January on Mauritius, and Madagascan breeders wintering on the African mainland moult in June and July.|$|E
500|$|The {{blackcap}} is a mainly grey warbler with distinct {{male and}} female plumages. The nominate subspecies is about [...] long with a [...] wing length. The weight is typically , but can be up to [...] for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to {{the outer edge of}} each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the iris is reddish brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed Sylvia species, such Sardinian and Orphean warblers have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap. They are also larger and have <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> on the tail.|$|E

500|$|Inocybe maculata has a conical or {{bell-shaped}} cap {{which is}} up to [...] in diameter. As the mushrooms age, the cap becomes flatter, and the broad umbo becomes prominent. The centre of the cap has white remains of the universal veil, especially on younger mushrooms. The cap is covered in fibres which extend from {{the centre of the}} cap to the margin (which is usually split). The cap is typically a chestnut brown in colour, though it is paler towards the margin. As well as chestnut, the camp has been described as [...] "Buckthorn brown", [...] "snuff brown", [...] "tawny olive" [...] and [...] "Saccardo's umber". Both cap colour and the presences of veil remnants are known to be very variable. In appearance, Inocybe maculata f. fulva has a lighter cap colour (typically more yellow to reddish-brown) and less (or even no) remnants of the veil on the cap. The gill attachment is adnate, meaning that the gills are attached to the stem along their entire depth. The gills are crowded, with <b>white</b> <b>edges</b> that are finely toothed. Younger mushrooms have gills that are greyish-white that eventually mature to an olive-brown colour. The stem {{is up to}} [...] in length, and generally cylindrical in shape, though it is often thicker towards the base. While the stem is initially solid, it later becomes hollow. There is often a small bulb {{at the base of the}} stem. The stem has cream colouration, becoming gradually browner with age. The base sometimes white and powdery. The flesh is white.|$|E
