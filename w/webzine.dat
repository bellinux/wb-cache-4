[...] Much of the original artwork appearing on the website, including the <b>webzine's</b> distinctive banner, was created by Berlin-based and Chilean born graphic designer and illustrator Cristóbal Schmal, [...] who often works under the moniker Nomono.

25|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers {{that the victim}} {{was killed by a}} hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review <b>webzine</b> The Portal.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} such successes, Australian heavy metal {{continues}} {{to remain a}} fringe underground culture still widely ignored by the mainstream industry and media. When it was announced in mid-2006 that the annual Metal for the Brain festival {{would be no more}} after a final event on 4 November, no regular news service outside of Canberra carried word of it, even though it had often attracted up to 3000 people and had been running as long as the Big Day Out. In an interview with Australian metal <b>webzine</b> , festival director Adam Agius suggested the festival would return in 2008; this now seems unlikely.|$|E

25|$|Michael has {{brown eyes}} and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is {{extremely}} handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Michael is romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to have his own <b>webzine</b> called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F. Skinner into proving {{the existence of a}} 'conditioned response', {{with the use of a}} specially designed box that held animals (such as rats and monkeys, in the experiment) until release, which could only be activated by pressing a lever. He started it with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{reviews of}} Before and After Science {{have also been}} positive. David Ross Smith of AllMusic awarded the album the highest rating of five stars stating that it ranks {{alongside}} Here Come the Warm Jets and Another Green World [...] "as the most essential Eno material". The music <b>webzine</b> Tiny Mix Tapes awarded the album their highest rating, stating that it [...] "is not {{only one of the}} best albums in Eno's catalog, but of the 1970s as a whole". Douglas Wolk of the <b>webzine</b> Pitchfork Media gave Before and After Science a perfect rating, calling the album [...] "the most conceptually elegant of Eno’s ’70s song-albums". Pitchfork placed Before and After Science at number 100 on their list of [...] "Top 100 Albums of the 1970s", referring to it as a [...] "lovely, charming album" [...] and going on to state that, while [...] "not formally groundbreaking, it's frequently overlooked when discussing great albums from an era that's romanticized as placing premiums on progression and innovation—and particularly in the context of Eno's career, which is so full of both".|$|E

500|$|Gary Westfahl of the <b>webzine</b> SF Site {{asserts that}} the use of a near-perfect {{parallel}} Earth is uninspired, referring to the setting as [...] "the most boring and unimaginative alien world imaginable". Among other reviews, TV Guide magazine describes Doppelgänger as a [...] "strange, little film" [...] with an [...] "overwritten script", and considers the subplot concerning Dr Hassler's treachery to be distracting. It awards a rating of two stars out of four. To Chris Bentley, writer of episode guides on the Anderson productions, Doppelgänger is a [...] "stylish and thought-provoking science-fiction thriller".|$|E
500|$|Matthew Cole, {{reviewing}} the mixtape in Slant Magazine, described Maya as [...] "an act of musical self-immolation from a self-styled outsider uncomfortable {{with her own}} marketability" [...] but that Vicki Leekx was an [...] "ensuing ground-zero dance party" [...] to follow up such a [...] "levelling of her image". Mike Schiller, writing for <b>webzine</b> PopMatters, was positive in his review but stated that the mix sounded like [...] "an artist throwing ideas at a wall and seeing what sticks". In consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave Vicki Leekx a B+ rating, indicating [...] "remarkable one way or another, yet also flirts with the humdrum or the half-assed".|$|E
500|$|Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the novel. In a review at the SF Site <b>webzine</b> he criticized the characterisation saying {{that he could not}} always separate the main characters. Kincaid questioned the need for the supernatural entity, the Typhon, which is never developed. He described the [...] "end of time" [...] sequence as [...] "the most powerful science fictional moment in this entire book", saying that he found it [...] "far more scary, far more gripping, than any supernatural intervention". Kincaid said that while he found the book [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "intellectually satisfying", [...] "somehow the whole feels less {{than the sum of its}} parts".|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based <b>webzine</b> The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record. I {{have a lot of respect}} for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. I just think it's lazy journalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} reviewer Anthony DeCurtis {{wrote that}} Beyoncé {{sounded as if}} she was [...] "having fun" [...] on the song, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the online music guide service AllMusic described Beyoncé's vocals as [...] "assured and sexy". Mark Anthony Neal of the international <b>webzine</b> PopMatters, regarded [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as one of the [...] "high-profile collaborations" [...] on Dangerously in Love. Lisa Verrico of the daily British newspaper The Times described the song a [...] "Latino-tinged collaboration ... Paul does a reggae rap in the middle, but it's when he chats while Beyoncé half raps that the pair have real chemistry". Yancey Strickler of the Flak magazine wrote that [...] "'Baby Boys diwali stutter is enhanced by Sean Paul's dancehall monotone".|$|E
500|$|Scott Esposito of <b>webzine</b> PopMatters {{gave the}} novel mixed comments, writing, [...] "it is no {{surprise}} that Apex Hides the Hurt, Whitehead's third novel, is packed with a number of allegorical elements blended into a multi-layered structure. What's unfortunate, however, is that all this technical artistry is in the service of unremarkable themes and ideas." [...] Entertainment website The A.V. Club complimented the book, writing, [...] "perhaps taking his cues from his protagonist's profession, Whitehead keeps his prose as streamlined as it comes, and he uses it to craft a satiric novel in tune with a moment where marketing overshadows content and even the lowliest blogger thinks in branding terms." [...] Michael McGirr of The Sydney Morning Herald called it [...] "a book of abundant irony".|$|E
