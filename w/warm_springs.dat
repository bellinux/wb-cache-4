5|$|In the 1964 renumbering, the {{legislative}} designation {{was changed to}} Route 680. SR 17 was officially moved to former Route 5 between San Jose and <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> which {{had not had a}} signed designation since the Nimitz Freeway (then I-680) was constructed, but this was instead marked as part of SR 238 (which replaced SR 9 north of Mission San Jose), and SR 17 remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway. This was very short-lived, as the Bureau of Public Roads approved a shift in the south end of I-680 in October 1964. The legislature changed the routes in 1965, swapping Routes 17 and 680 south of <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> and creating a new SR 262 on the short roadway at <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs</b> where they had overlapped to switch sides. However, until I-680 was completed in the early-to-mid 1970s, it remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway, and the old road between San Jose and <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs</b> continued to be marked as SR 238. One more change was made to the routing of I-680: in July 1973, the remainder of SR 21, from Benicia to Fairfield, was added to the Interstate Highway System. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. The corresponding changes were made by the state legislature in 1976.|$|E

5|$|As river {{development}} {{continued in}} the 20thcentury, each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam, beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938. The development was accompanied by extensive negotiations between natives and US government agencies. The Confederated Tribes of <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> a coalition of various tribes, adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids; Still, in the 1930s, there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round, moving along with the fish's migration patterns throughout the seasons. The Yakama were slower to do so, organizing a formal government in 1944. In the 21stcentury, the Yakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs</b> tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Celilo Falls was {{submerged}} by {{the construction}} of The Dalles Dam, and the native fishing community was displaced.

5|$|At Martinez, the Martinez-Benicia Ferry took {{automobiles}} {{across the}} Carquinez Strait to Benicia, where Route 7, {{one of the}} original state highways from the 1910 bond issue, led north and northeast past Fairfield towards Sacramento and Oregon. The portion north from Benicia to Fairfield became part of Route 74 in 1935, when Route 7 was realigned to the more direct American Canyon route that is now I-80. None of the aforementioned roads were given state sign route numbers in 1934, when that system was laid out, but by 1937 they had been numbered SR 21. This route began at the intersection of <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs</b> Boulevard and Brown Road in <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> where Route 5 and Route 69 (SR 17) split, followed Route 5 along Mission Boulevard to Mission San Jose (this part later became an overlap with SR 9), and then continued to US 40 (Route 7) at Cordelia. The routing was very close to the present I-680, following such roads as Pleasanton Sunol Road, San Ramon Valley Boulevard, Danville Boulevard, Main Street in Walnut Creek, Contra Costa Boulevard, and Pacheco Boulevard.|$|E

30|$|The {{area covered}} by this study lies {{approximately}} between geographic latitudes 7 ° 00 ′N and 8 ° 00 ′N and geographic longitude 4 ° 30 ′E and 5 ° 30 ′E within the Precambrian of southwestern Nigeria. The area {{is covered by}} the aeromagnetic map sheet 243 (Ilesha), 244 (Ado-Ekiti), 263 (Ondo) and 264 (Akure) spanning an area of approximately 12, 400 km 2. Adegbuyi and Abimbola ([1997]) performed an extensive research on the energy resource potential of the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring</b> area using the technique of Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). They investigated the radiochemical contents of uranium (U), thorium (Th) and potassium (K) in a surface rock collection from the area and predicted {{the source of the}} <b>warm</b> <b>spring’s</b> heat to be radioactive probably acquired by meteoric water at depth from thorium-bearing zones of the quartzite host rock of the spring. Samples of the <b>warm</b> <b>spring</b> water and host quartzite rock collected from Ikogosi area were analysed for the fluid physio-chemical characteristics and rock radioactivity in a bid to predict the source of water and the associated heat content (Rogers et al. [1969]; Loehnert [1985]; Adegbuyi et al. [1996]). The results were almost similar with predictions made about radioactivity and high geothermal gradient responsible for the heat of the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring.</b> Joshua and Alabi ([2012]) investigated the pattern of radiogenic heat production in rock samples of southwestern Nigeria while Oladipo et al. ([2005]) carried out hydrochemical analysis on water samples from the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring</b> in southwestern Nigeria. Earlier studies of the <b>warm</b> <b>spring</b> have been restricted to geological and geochemical investigations (Rogers et al. [1969]; Loehnert [1985], Adegbuyi et al. [1996]; Ajayi et al. [1996]). Ojo et al. ([2011]) carried out an investigation of the geological structure beneath the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring</b> in southwestern Nigeria using integrated surface geophysical methods. They integrated vertical electrical sounding (VES) and magnetic methods in the immediate vicinity of the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring</b> with a view to delineate its subsurface geological sequence and evaluate the structural setting beneath the <b>warm</b> <b>spring.</b> They used inverse magnetic models and geoelectrical sections to delineate fractured quartzite/faulted areas within fresh massive quartzite at varying depths. It was deduced that the fractured/faulted quartzite may have acted as conduit for the movement of warm groundwater from profound depths to the surface while the spring outlet was located on a geological interface (lineament).|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the Ikogosi <b>Warm</b> <b>Spring</b> in South West Nigeria has been studied. Four {{out of the}} six <b>warm</b> <b>spring</b> primary sources show close similarity in temperature, pH, dissolved solids, suspended solid, alkalinity, hardness, SO 4 2 -, Cl - and trace metals. All measured values are within classification as fresh water and WHO standards. Further study of the <b>warm</b> <b>spring</b> flow reveal a time (distance) dependent atmospheric environmental induced variations. These variations were made manifest through the optimization of AAS machine parameters such as observation height, PMT voltage, hollow cathode lamp current and optical beam wavelength. A comparison has also been made between the <b>warm</b> <b>spring,</b> a cold stream and the normal ground water of the area through direct and simultaneous measurement of the hiked parameters. Major differences in T, hardness, SO 4 2 -, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Zn, Pb and Cd contents imply the existence of unexplored processes on the spring water...|$|R

5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E

5|$|The Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} urban {{routes of}} the Interstate Highway System on September 15, 1955, including a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) {{began at the}} interchange of US 101 north of downtown San Jose and followed the Nimitz Freeway (SR 17/Route 69, now I-880) to the split at <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs</b> (the present location of SR 262), SR 21 to Benicia, and Route 74 (no sign route number) to I-80 in Vallejo. The first piece of I-680 freeway built, other than the pre-existing Nimitz Freeway, was in the late 1950s, along the SR 24 overlap between North Main Street in Walnut Creek and Monument Boulevard in Pleasant Hill. A southerly extension, bypassing downtown Walnut Creek to South Main Street, opened on March 22, 1960, connecting with the SR 24 freeway to Oakland. In the next decade, the freeway was completed from Vallejo south to SR 238 at Mission San Jose, and the roadway north from Benicia to Fairfield, which became the only remaining piece of SR 21, was also upgraded to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in <b>Warm</b> <b>Springs,</b> Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
