But when there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to upgrade, Hearn wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the innovation is confined to the first few hours".

500|$|In September1909 {{newspapers}} carried {{reports that}} Cook and Peary had each reached the North Pole, Cook in April1908 and Peary a year later. Asked to comment, Amundsen avoided an outright endorsement of either explorer, but surmised that [...] "probably something {{will be left}} to be done". While he avoided {{the controversy over the}} rival claims, [...] he saw immediately that his own plans would be seriously affected. Without the allure of capturing the pole, he would struggle to maintain public interest or funding. [...] "If the expedition was to be saved... there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> for me but to try and solve the last great problem—the South Pole". Thus Amundsen decided to go south; the Arctic drift could wait [...] "for a year or two" [...] until the South Pole had been conquered.|$|E

500|$|Not until news of {{the victory}} at San Jacinto spread did the {{refugees}} return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to go back to, but those who went home began {{to pick up their}} lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: [...] "The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but the women, with their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1880s, {{sections}} of the American press popularized {{the notion that the}} West had been won and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to conquer in the United States. The time when great scouts like Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close. Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro, were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs like Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, and Geronimo only in Wild West Shows. In 1890 the United States Census Bureau formally closed the American frontier, ending the system under which land in the Western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers. [...] As a [...] "soldier of fortune", as Richard Harding Davis later called him, Burnham began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier, feeling that the American West was becoming tame and unchallenging. When he heard of the work of Cecil Rhodes and his pioneers in southern Africa, who were working to build a railway across Africa from Cape to Cairo, Burnham sold what little he owned. In 1893 with his wife and young son, he set sail for Durban in South Africa, intending to join Rhodes's pioneers in Matabeleland and Mashonaland.|$|E
500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't {{know what else to do}} about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E

Much of reason behind Slim's overseas expansion was due to a running joke in the Mexican business scene where [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> to acquire in Mexico". [...] He eyed towards investing the United States where he set up Telmex USA and also acquired a stake in Tracfone, a US cellular telephone company. At the same time, he established Carso Infraestructura y Construcción, S. A. (CICSA) as a construction and engineering company within Grupo Carso. During the same year, Slim had heart surgery and subsequently passed on much of the day-to-day involvement in the businesses to his children and their spouses.|$|E

[...] The junker stripped everything out of Minto, furniture, boilers, engines and even the paddlewheel. [...] There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> except the hull and the empty cabins and pilot house.

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Saturday 23 March, German troops broke through the line in the 14th Division sector on the canal at Jussy. The 54th Brigade were holding the line {{directly}} to their south and were initially unaware of their predicament, as they were unknowingly being outflanked and surrounded. The 54th Brigade History records [...] "the weather still favoured the Germans. Fog was thick over the rivers, canals and little valleys, so that he could bring up fresh masses of troops unseen". In the confusion, Brigade HQ tried to establish what was happening around Jussy and by late morning the British were retreating in front of German troops who had crossed the Crozat Canal at many points.

2500|$|By 618, with {{virtually}} entire empire engulfed in warfare from the rebellions against her husband's rule, Empress Xiao {{was with her}} husband at Jiangdu (江都), the capital of Yang Province. They were protected (as he believed) by the elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果). [...] However, by this point, even the Xiaoguo soldiers were plotting rebellion, as they missed their families in the north. [...] When a lady in waiting reported the plot to Empress Xiao, she told the lady in waiting, [...] "I will let you report it to the emperor." [...] Emperor Yang, not willing to hear any bad news, however, instead executed the lady in waiting. Later, when other ladies in waiting wanted {{to report on the}} plot, Empress Xiao advised them against it, reasoning that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> that could save the dynasty. Soon, a plot led by the general Yuwen Huaji came to fruition, and Emperor Yang, along with his sons Yang Jian and Yang Gao and grandson Yang Tan the Prince of Yan were killed. Empress Xiao and her ladies in waiting wrapped him in a mat and made caskets for both Emperor Yang and Yang Gao.|$|E
2500|$|One early recruit to {{join the}} {{regiment}} was named Jack Jackson. Jackson {{was said to be}} very large and strong-willed and quickly became a Sergeant in Company B. At some point Jackson joined the regimental recruiting parties; the officers were having trouble with convincing local field hands to join. Jackson's recruiting method was described as very forceful but ultimately successful. At the Battle of Milliken's Bend one of Jackson´s superior officers, Lieutenant David Cornwell, described the attack; saying that the 23rd Iowa was not behaving courageously but the three black infantry regiments offered great resistance. He said that Jackson, [...] "Laid into a group of Texans... smashing in every head he could reach", and that, [...] "Big Jack Jackson passed me like a rocket. With the fury of a tiger he sprang into that gang and crushed everything before him. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> of Jack's gun except the barrel and he was smashing everything he could reach.

2500|$|In the Battle of Manila, the United States {{captured}} {{the city from}} the Spanish. This battle marked an end of Filipino-American collaboration, as Filipino forces were prevented from entering the captured city of Manila, an action deeply resented by the Filipinos. Spain and the United States sent commissioners to Paris to draw up {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish–American War. The Filipino representative, Felipe Agoncillo, was excluded from sessions as the revolutionary government was not recognized by the family of nations. Although there was substantial domestic opposition, the United States decided to annex the Philippines. In addition to Guam and Puerto Rico, Spain was forced in the negotiations to hand over the Philippines to the U.S. in exchange for US$20,000,000.00. U.S. President McKinley justified the annexation of the Philippines by saying that it was [...] "a gift from the gods" [...] and that since [...] "they were unfit for self-government, … there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them", in spite of the Philippines having been already Christianized by the Spanish {{over the course of several}} centuries.
