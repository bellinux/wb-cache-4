5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to both have a public persona favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV.

5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned. Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks {{and some}} of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that received much attention from the Australian public. He won his heat of the 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> secure the gold medal in a close contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Bailey left Charlton {{to replace}} Alan Mullery as Brighton & Hove Albion manager, and the Charlton board {{ironically}} decided to name Mullery as Bailey's successor. Charlton finished the 1981–82 season in 13th place, and Walsh scored 15 goals in total. He performed well against divisional champions Luton Town, giving captain Mal Donaghy a difficult afternoon, which <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win him {{a move to}} his next club.|$|E

It was {{replaced}} with Fiona for the 2010 season. Due to a request by France in the 2003 WMO Meeting, the name Frances was to be removed from the rotating cyclone lists after the 2004 hurricane season, even if Frances wasn't as destructive, but the destruction caused by Frances in the United States <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant retirement on its own merit.|$|E

He put Milne on the left-wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E
