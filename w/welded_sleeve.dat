40|$|This {{research}} examine on {{the effectiveness}} of tapered sleeve connector in providing confinement effect to embedded reinforcement bar. The objectives of the investigation are to study the bond mechanism of grouted sleeve connector and to study the effects of confinement provided by the grouted sleeve connector. Two different configurations (<b>welded</b> bar <b>sleeve</b> and tapered sleeve) of sleeve connector were used in this study. Various sleeve diameters were used in this research to study their effects on the bond mechanism. The bond failure progression inside the grouted sleeve connector was observed visually as halved welded steel bar connector and tapered head connector were used. The experimental works consisted two phases where phase I was the testing of plain grouted sleeve. Phase II involved the testing steel fibre reinforced grout sleeve. Steel fibres of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 % were introduced to the connector in a way so the grout inside the connector will exhibit post-cracking behaviour. Pull-out tests were carried out and it was observed that the performance of tapered sleeve was better than <b>welded</b> bar <b>sleeve</b> due to higher confinement level. The provision of sufficient confinement stress able to delay the development of splitting cracks. The test result showed that <b>welded</b> bar <b>sleeve</b> was governed by splitting failure mode, whereas tapered sleeve failed in pull-out failure mode...|$|R

40|$|The first LHC long {{shutdown}} {{was driven}} {{by the need to}} consolidate the 13 kA splices between the superconducting magnets to safely attain its center of mass design energy of 14 TeV. Access to the splices requires the opening of <b>welded</b> <b>sleeves</b> by machining. After consolidation, the sleeves are re-welded using a TIG orbital welding. The welding process has been modified from the original “as-new” installation in order to better adapt to the “as repaired” situation. The intervention has been thoroughly prepared through qualifications, organisation of teams, their training and follow-up. Quality control is based on the qualification of equipment, process and operators; the recording of production parameters; regular process audits and production witness samples; visual inspection through an official certifying body. The paper also describes welding and quality control of special intervention cases, with issues of difficult access requiring innovative solutions. This work concerns over 10 000 welds and a team of 40 engineers and technicians over a period of 18 months. The experience and lessons learnt will be applicable to similar large complex projects...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that Maynard was planning to climb Mount Kilimanjaro without the aid of prosthetics. To prepare for the climb, he trained at a series of locations around the US, including Stone Mountain and Blood Mountain in Georgia, Winter Park in Colorado, and Camelback Mountain in Arizona, with expedition co-leader, [...] Dan Adams, testing and developing equipment that included <b>welding</b> <b>sleeves</b> and rubber bicycle tires attached to his body with heavy-duty tape. Soon, an organization called Orthotic Specialists got involved, and owners Barb and Brett Boutin created custom equipment with Vibram soles, based on molds of Maynard's arms and legs. The climb, intended to raise awareness for wounded American military veterans, included a team consisting of former members of the U.S. military with injuries and conditions including shrapnel wounds, post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury. The mission also donated $25,000 worth of medical supplies to the Mwereni Integrated School for the Blind in Moshi, Tanzania. Guided by Kevin Cherilla of K2 Adventures Foundation, the group began their climb on January 6, 2012, with 16 days allotted for the climb. On January 15, 2012, Maynard became the first quadruple amputee to climb Mount Kilimanjaro without assistance, by crawling all 19,340 feet in just 10 days. In 2012, he was awarded his second ESPY for best male athlete with a disability for completing the climb.|$|R

The need to reach and bring the hydrocarbons from the fields located in deep and ultra-deep waters, imposes the need to improve the technologies and techniques in order to repair any unacceptable damage in pipeline. The main objective of this work is to investigate various methods for repairing a subsea pipeline that has been damaged and that is below diving depth. The investigation covers the methods that are applicable for three different water depths of 150, 350 and 1350 meters, two different pipe sizes of 12 and 28 inches and two different length of lines: 5 km (e. g. in-field pipeline) and 500 km (e. g. export pipeline). Since the cause and severity of damage determines the necessity and type of required repair, it is significant to study different scenarios of damage: dent, crack (field joint) and corrosion.

Nowadays, selection of proper repair method on in-service natural gas pipeline {{is a matter}} of primary concern of Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS). Therefore, the systematic study has been required for the repair methods of API 5 L X 65 main pipeline operating under the internal pressure of 6. 9 MPa whose diameter is 762 mm and thickness is 17. 5 mm. The objective of this work is to investigate the fracture behavior of repaired pipe using full scale burst test and to select the appropriate repair method of in-service gas pipelines. We performed a series of full scale burst test for damaged pipe and each repaired pipe and analyzed the fracture behavior on API 5 L X 65 grade gas pipelines (diameter 762 mm, thickness 17. 5 mm) with mechanically machined defects.

40|$|Mechanical damage {{involving}} dents with gouges {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of transmission pipeline failures in terms of both static and cyclic pressure loading. Because of the severity of this defect type, pipeline companies are required to respond to these anomalies by either removing damaged sections or repair using <b>welded</b> <b>sleeves.</b> For more than 10 years, composite materials have been used to repair corroded pipelines and their use has gained wide acceptance across the pipeline industry. Numerous systems have been tested with results being presented in the open literature. Testing was recently performed to assess the use of a water-activated composite repair system, Aquawrap®, in terms of its ability to repair mechanical damage subjected to cyclic pressure service. The Aquawrap ® repair system has been extensively tested on corrosion defects but testing on pipes with dents had not been done. The water activated pre-preg urethane resin system offers excellent long tern (creep-rupture) strength combined with easy low cost field installation. Pipes having diameter to wall thickness ratios ranging from 34 to 68 were fitted with dents and gouges. Repair involved removing the gouged material of the pipe after indentation and repairing using the composite sleeve. The result of this specific test program showed that on-average the fatigue life for mechanically-damaged pipes can be increased on the order of three orders of magnitude when repaired by grinding and installing composite sleeves. This paper provides details on the methodology of the test program, results, and most importantly, information that can be used by operators in repairing their pipeline systems...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} a new grouted splice connection for wall panels, called <b>Welded</b> Bar <b>Sleeve</b> (WBS). The connections were made from steel pipes and tested with incremental tensile, shear and flexural loads until failure. The aim {{is to determine the}} behaviour of the connection under the three load cases. For this, the connections are evaluated in terms of the load–displacement responses, ultimate capacities, ductility responses and some feasibility assessment criteria. WBS was found to provide sufficient strength at the bar embedded length of 8, 8 and 11 times the bar diameter under tensile, shear and flexural loads, respectively. It is effective under tension, but could only service up to 1 / 3 of its ultimate shear capacity. Flexural load is the most critical load case for the connection. For this, further enhancements are required when subjected to shear and flexural loads.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} automotive {{steel wheel}} rim {{is made from}} a rectangular sheet metal. The metal plate is bent to produce a cylindrical sleeve with the two free edges of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>welded</b> together. At least one cylindrical flow spinning operation is carried out to obtain a given thickness profile of the sleeve—in particular comprising in the zone intended to constitute the outer seat an angle of inclination relative to the axial direction. The sleeve is then shaped to obtain the rims on each side with a radially inner cylindrical wall in the zone of the outer seat and with a radially outer [...] wall inclined at an angle corresponding to the standard inclination of the rim seats. The rim is then calibrated.|$|R
40|$|This study tests grouted splices {{connected}} by {{two types of}} <b>sleeves,</b> namely <b>Welded</b> Bar <b>Sleeve</b> (WBS) and Tapered Head Sleeve (THS). These sleeves are made from non-proprietary pipe sections, where (a) WBS is fabricated by welding the deformed bars to the inner wall of the pipe, and (b) THS is made tapered with smaller openings at both ends. To study the behavior, the splice specimens were tested under incremental tensile load at various bar embedded lengths and sleeve diameters. The degree of confinement generated in the sleeve is found to increase with decreasing sleeve diameter. This improves the bond strength in sleeve, which subsequently increases the tensile capacity of the splice. THS gives a 30 % higher tensile capacity compared with WBS. With the active confinement, the required bar embedded length of the splice {{can be reduced to}} 8 times the bar diameter. An analytical model is formulated {{on the basis of the}} confinement stress as expressed in a function of sleeve dimensions. The model is used to predict the tensile capacities of the splices at a variation range of ± 10 % of the experimental results. This verifies the correlations among the sleeve dimensions, the confinement stress and bond strength of the grouted splice...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{mechanical}} loads and moisture related problems with a potential to critically harm the functionality of pre-insulated district heating pipes and pipe joints. Directly buried pipeline bends are investigated with respect to limiting deformations from a thermally induced lateral displacement. A new approach is introduced; stating that very large deformations of the insulation foam are tolerable as long as overheating of the casing pipe is avoided. A local increase in heat losses and loss of axial shear stiffness is not critical, but a too high temperature will accelerate the rate of deterioration of the polyethylene material. Measurements indicate that the earth pressures required to reach critical deformations {{are not likely to}} develop in regularly compacted backfill materials. Problems related to backfilling with reused excavated soil containing coarse-grained materials are of particular interest. The lifetime implications from large stones causing deep indentations in the casing pipe wall are studied. A conceptual framework for the force interaction between a laterally displaced pipe and a stone adjacent to it is presented, along with tests on the long-term strength of severely strained polyethylene. The risk for obtaining deep indentations depends on the compaction of the backfill, and is greatest in materials compacted to "ordinary" levels. There is an obvious temperature dependence in the expected lifetime. To avoid the combination of indentations and an elevated casing pipe temperature, compaction of backfill material containing large stones should be avoided around pipeline bends. The strength of pipe joints to axial movements through coarse-grained backfill material is studied experimentally. It is concluded that electro-fusion <b>welded</b> <b>sleeves</b> are superior to other types. But with a simple external protection, consisting of a polyethylene net, the much cheaper single-sealed non-shrinking sleeve can be used in very tough backfill materials. The consequences of a leaking joint seal are investigated experimentally and analytically. Homogeneous and defect-free PUR foam will act as a moisture barrier, protecting the medium pipe from water. Air-gaps or voids in the foam may promote an inflow of groundwater by a "breathing effect" caused by temperature variations. Hence in order to improve the performance of the joints, efforts should be made to develop the methods for foam injection to ensure a complete filling of the joint space. Vapour diffusion in plastics pipes heating systems and in cooling systems is studied analytically. In heating systems with polyethylene medium pipes, vapour will diffuse outward and possibly condensate and accumulate in the colder parts of the insulation foam. Calculations indicate that the increase in heat losses during the first 50 years of service is about 25 - 30 %. In cooling pipes, vapour passing in from saturated soil will condense in the colder insulation. Simplified calculations show that condensation of water starts almost immediately...|$|R
5000|$|Polar Sea {{has been}} out of service since 2010 due to {{complete}} failure of five of her six Alco main diesel engines. Examination of her engines indicated excessive engine wear, with engine pistons <b>welded</b> to their <b>sleeves.</b> A root cause analysis apparently traced the problem to improper installation of piston rings and/or installation of incorrect (chromed vs. plain) rings. In 2011 the Coast Guard slated Polar Sea for demolition in 2012, but the scrapping of the 35-year-old icebreaker was postponed by Congress for at least six months in June. A congressional authorization required the Coast Guard to make a report to Congress on the feasibility of retrofitting Polar Sea. The report was submitted in November 2013 and indicated that it is feasible to retrofit and reactivate Polar Sea. As of 25 February 2015 the laid up ship was still in limbo alongside a pier at the Coast Guard Station on Elliott Bay, Seattle. It has not been determined if a new class may be funded, commercial icebreaker leasing options will be explored, and/or if the ship should be scrapped.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding Process is a {{solid state}} joining process {{manufacturing}} excellent mechanical properties of the joint. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the influence of the tool wear on selected quality criteria such as the lap shear strength and the surface quality of the joint as well as the required electric current that is an indicator for the process forces and torques. Based on the result of 22 duration tests with 3, 500 <b>welding</b> points the <b>sleeve</b> can be identified as the most stressed tool part with a maximum wear of 0. 3 mm. The tool wear depends on the gap size between the tool parts that are loaded with plasticized work piece material. The volume of the material influences the required torque of the main spindle and the tool temperature. At reaching 70 % to 80 % of the maximum tool wear the process temperature rapidly increases. Another result is the independence of lap shear strength of the joints on tool wear. But within the duration tests the mechanical characteristics were increased (about 7, 000 N before and 8, 300 N after one duration test in average) by achieving larger temperatures. The surface quality is slightly influenced by the tool wear. The height of the surrounding burr that occurs at the boundary of clamping ring and sleeve is 0. 25 mm for a worn out tool. Furthermore key indicators that were developed in past studies are validated to be useful for a condition monitoring approach by showing significant changes for increasing tool wear...|$|R
