40|$|The cold-compression stress <b>relief</b> <b>process</b> used {{to reduce}} the quench-induced {{stresses}} in high-strength aerospace aluminum alloy forgings does not fully relieve the stresses. This study measured and predicted the residual stress in 7050 -T 74 (solution heat treated, quenched, and artificially overaged) and 7050 -T 7452 (cold compressed prior to aging) hand forgings. The manufacturing process was simulated by finite element analysis. First, a thermal analysis simulated the quench using appropriate thermal boundary conditions and temperature dependent material properties. Second, a structural analysis used the thermal history and a temperature and strain-rate dependent constitutive model to predict the stresses after quenching. Third, the structural analysis was continued to simulate the multiple cold compressions of the stress <b>relief</b> <b>process.</b> Experimentally, the residual stresses in the forgings were mapped using the contour method, which involved cutting the forgings using wire EDM and then measuring the contour of the cut surface using a CMM. Multiple cuts were used to map different stress components. The results show a spatially periodic variation of stresses that results from the periodic nature of the cold work stress <b>relief</b> <b>process.</b> The results compare favorably with the finite element prediction of the stresses...|$|R

Lessons learned from recent humanitarian disasters point to major difficulties in establishing communications to quickly and accurately assess responder needs in the affected area and communicating this information to first responders from government relief agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the military. The militarys growing role in Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) missions makes it imperative that military first responders coordinate with partner relief groups to improve the current assessment and <b>relief</b> <b>processes.</b> The current assessment and <b>relief</b> <b>processes</b> are generally ineffective due to inherent mistrust between responding organizations and lack of experience working together in a chaotic and time-pressed environment.

[...] Relief prints were made by printing with engraved and coloured wood blocks.

Therefore, for iDHD, the procedure is changed to be performed incrementally, with the core being cut (trepanned) in several steps of increasing depth and the diameter measurements being performed in between each step. The analysis then incorporates this sequence of incremental distortions for calculating the high magnitude residual stresses.|$|R

Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) technique such as selective laser melting (SLM) process is progressively being utilized for new biomaterials such as cobalt-chrome-molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo). The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of different structural design porosity of Cobalt-Chromium Molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) sample produced by laser sintering process. The second objective is to evaluate the mechanical and physical properties of open cellular structure Co-Cr-Mo samples fabricated by SLM with designed volume based porosity ranging between 0 % (full dense) to 80 %. A maximum 2. 10 % shrinkage was successfully obtained by 80 % designed porosity sample. Samples with higher volume-to-surface area (full dense) demonstrated low total amount of shrinkage as compared to lower volume-to-surface area (80 % designed porosity). This paper also discusses mechanical characterization of porous medical grade Co-Cr alloy in cubical structures with volume based porosity ranging between 60 % and 80 % produced using SLM rapid manufacturing process. For compression test, 60 % designed porosity exhibit higher elastic modulus compared to 70 % and 80 % designed porosity.

40|$|Silicon is {{the most}} widely used {{semiconductor}} material for MEMS and electronic applications. The strength of silicon has a critical impact on the reliable and accurate function of these components. In packaging assembly, reliability tests as well as in operation life the silicon die can be exposed to high stresses. For a theoretical risk assessment of die cracking due to the mentioned loadings a failure criterion is needed, which is capable to account the processing history. Therefore, the experimental characterization via fracture tests, analysis of different Si surface structures by Laser-Scanning-Microscopy (LSM) and Transmission-Electron-Microscopy (TEM) and a numerical approach using Finite Element Simulation was combined to allow failure prediction. In the fracture tests the influences of the backside grinding and the stress <b>relief</b> <b>processes</b> were investigated. The test dies were fabricated using the Dicing-before-Grinding (DBG) process with different mesh sizes of the grinding wheel. Additionally dry polishing and plasma etching were applied as stress <b>relief</b> <b>processes.</b> Bending tests are commonly used for the strength characterization of brittle materials like ceramics and silicon. The ball-ring-test was conducted to exclude edge effects on the strength, which are still under investigation in an additional part of the study. It was found that the determined fracture stresses follow a three-parametric Weibull distribution. The surface topography and roughness, respectively, was measured via LSM. TEM was applied to determine the structure of the surface-near damage-layer. In addition to the experimental investigations numerical calculations by means of Finite Element Simulations were performed in order to calculate critical fracture stresses from testing including anisotropic and geometric nonlinear effects. Furthermore, a submodeling-technique was applied to understand the effects of experimentally observed surface states on the critical stress, i. e. roughness, grinding marks, flaws, and poly Si-layers. Detailed modeling included local modeling of surface roughness on the critical strength...|$|R
