500|$|William Clark of Guitar International {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, {{and said that}} the record features [...] "some of the most elaborate, expansive, and simply <b>wowing</b> guitar playing that Eddie has passionately poured into a single album". Spin wrote, [...] "the frantic, haute-for-teacher 'As Is' and the mid-tempo shoulda-been-the-single 'You and Your Blues' can hang with any heavy-breathing romp they made in their heyday." [...] Jerry Shriver of USA Today gave the album 3.5/4 stars, saying that [...] "this is the true kick in the butt that arena rock desperately needs." [...] However, in the newspaper's year-end retrospective, Edna Gundersen listed A Different Kind of Truth among the overrated albums of 2012, stating that [...] "the reheated meat-and-potato riffs of Van Halen's past had critics swooning and fans panting, but vanished from the charts after the band's tour was scrapped" [...] and the album deservedly got shut out of Grammy Award nominations. Guitar World picked A Different Kind of Truth as the best album of 2012. Rolling Stone named [...] "Stay Frosty" [...] the 16th best song of 2012, and the magazine's readers ranked it the fifth best album of the year.|$|E

Still, the world-regenerators may really be quite excellent performers on their own jews'-harps. Blame the edginess of my teeth.|$|E
