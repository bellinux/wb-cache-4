500|$|From 1990 until 1993, Scott {{worked at}} WESH, an NBC {{affiliate}} in Orlando, Florida {{as a sports}} reporter and sports anchor. While at WESH, he met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Ramsey said of Scott: [...] "You knew the second he <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{that it was a}} pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. He went out and did a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN." [...] He earned first place honors from the Central Florida Press Club for a feature on rodeo.|$|E
500|$|In December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded {{their former}} managers—father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert—to {{set up a}} {{showcase}} in front of industry writers, producers and A men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Among the attendees was BMG Publishing's Mark Fox, former percussionist of new wave '80s band, Haircut One Hundred. Since the showcase, Fox was unofficially helping the group to get contacts in the business. In May 1995, he introduced the group to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Fox phoned the duo and told them: [...] "You won't believe it, but I've got your act. They've just <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> They're beautiful, everything you've been looking for. I'll bring them down straight away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Numan also {{developed}} his style. According to Numan, {{this was an}} unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on Top of the Pops, he had [...] "spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before I'd even <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show". His [...] "wooden" [...] stage presence was, in his words, a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of [...] "showmanship" [...] and {{often referred to as}} being [...] "like an android". During this period, Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves [...] "Numanoids", providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through {{the latter half of the}} 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall precipitously.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and I heard them playing, {{it was like a}} revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The Replacements {{returned}} to New York in June 1983, playing at CBGB. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry, Bob Stinson {{was thrown out}} as soon as he <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because [...] "The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out," [...] according to manager Jesperson. The band supported R.E.M. on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low, and Westerberg later stated, [...] "We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Attorney General Office criticized O'Keefe for {{not acting}} as a {{journalist}} trying to objectively report a story from the facts, noting instead that O'Keefe stated he [...] "was {{out to make a}} point and to damage ACORN." [...] The report said:The video releases were heavily edited to feature only the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some of the most salient statements by O'Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> seeking assistance. Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos.For instance, one much-publicized recording had shown O'Keefe and Giles at the San Diego office. They show a worker purportedly seeking information from a contact in Mexico to help them smuggle underage girls from Mexico into the United States to work as prostitutes. The video did not show that the worker's [...] "contact" [...] in Mexico was a police official. The employee collected as much specific information from Giles and O'Keefe as possible during their visit. The worker then contacted Mexican police to warn them of the plot. The AG Office's report stated, [...] "ACORN was not the criminal enterprise described by O'Keefe in his 'Chaos for Glory' statement – it did not receive billions in federal funds and did not control elections. ACORN is, however, disorganized and its operations were far from transparent, leaving it vulnerable to allegations of illegal activity and misuse of funds." [...] The report also noted that despite O'Keefe's appearing in the released videos in [...] "stereotypical 1970s pimp garb", in his actual taped sessions with ACORN workers, he was dressed in a shirt and tie, presented himself as a law student, and said he planned to use the prostitution proceeds to run for Congress, and never claimed he was a pimp.|$|E

50|$|In many countries, {{lawyers are}} general {{practitioners}} {{who will take}} almost any kind of case that <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>In</b> others, {{there has been a}} tendency {{since the start of the}} 20th century for lawyers to specialize early in their careers.

2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, when I <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E

One of the blacks opened the door of the prison with a huge key, we <b>walked</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed behind us, the lock grated, and with the sound there swept over me again that terrible feeling of hopelessness that I had felt in the Chamber of Mystery in the Golden Cliffs beneath the gardens of the Holy Therns.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a little}} talk, and then {{two of the men}} went out and brought back a couple of strong ropes. A few minutes after their return Mark Thorndyke came in. He paused as he entered the room, in {{surprise}} at the silence that reigned, for he was accustomed to be greeted with friendly exclamations. However, as he <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed, and then suddenly, with shouts of [...] "Down with the spy!" [...] the men sprang from their seats and made a sudden rush at him. For a minute the struggle was tremendous; man after man went down under Mark's blows, others clung onto him from behind, a rope was passed round his legs and pulled, and he fell down with a crash, bringing down five or six of his assailants; a minute later he was gagged and bound.|$|E
