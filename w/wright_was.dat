5|$|<b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> {{deeply in}} debt {{following}} {{the destruction of}} Taliesin II.

5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of <b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, <b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} gigging that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London.

5|$|The Green Bay Packers {{had seven}} {{different}} players each contribute a sack, and Randy Wright's 190 yards passing {{made him the}} second player in Packers history to throw for 3,000 yards in a season. The crowd cheered the news that an Indianapolis Colts win moved the Buccaneers into first place {{for the rights to}} the first overall draft pick, and pelted Buccaneer players with lemons. Ron Holmes's sack of <b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> the Buccaneers' first since Oct. 12, and Ivory Sully recorded the first blocked punt in Buccaneers (regular-season) history. Both teams went to their second-string quarterbacks in the second half, but Steve Young returned to the game after Steve DeBerg suffered a concussion, and <b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> reinserted after the Buccaneers threatened to start a comeback.|$|E
5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the Christmas and New Year period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. <b>Wright</b> <b>was</b> Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E
