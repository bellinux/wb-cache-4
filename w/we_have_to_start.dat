Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, [...] "Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material." [...] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory, while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.|$|E

She {{could just make}} out Stewart's tall form as he leaned against his horse. Either he was listening or debating what to do--perhaps both. Presently he went inside the cabin. Madeline heard the scratching of a match; then she saw a faint light. The cabin appeared to be deserted.

50|$|A {{natural way}} to resolve {{singularities}} is to repeatedly blow up some canonically chosen smooth subvariety. This runs into the following problem. The singular set of x2 = y2z2 is the pair of lines given by the y and z axes. The only reasonable varieties to blow up are the origin, {{one of these two}} axes, or the whole singular set (both axes). However the whole singular set cannot be used since it is not smooth, and choosing one of the two axes breaks the symmetry between them so is not canonical. This means <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> by blowing up the origin, but this reproduces the original singularity, so we seem to be going round in circles.|$|E
