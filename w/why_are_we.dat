Representative Steve Largent (R-OK) said, [...] "It'll be {{on the radar screen}} for sure ... <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> giving taxpayer money to sue taxpayers?"

500|$|Corgan and Chamberlin {{continued}} to {{record as a}} duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles [...] "Superchrist" [...] and [...] "G.L.O.W." [...] later that year. That November, the group released the DVD If All Goes Wrong, which chronicled the group's 2007 concert residences in Asheville, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, [...] "The listening patterns have changed, so <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track {{to set up the}} single?

500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{thought the}} episode {{was similar to}} Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo [...] "coldly calculating", writing [...] "This is but another version of the tired cliché of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> so afraid of smart people?... It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience {{with the idea that}} intellectuals are dangerous." [...] Stegall was pleased to have the first [...] "standalone" [...] episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could [...] "relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant."

500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I {{want to give them}} even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, {{some critics}} pointed {{out how the}} lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others {{emphasised}} the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, [...] "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." [...] In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was [...] "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." [...] When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, [...] "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." [...] Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, [...] "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." [...] In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, [...] "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that [...] "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its [...] "enduring popularity".|$|E

In the interview, he denied that he is a monarchist or in favor of war with Iran; indicating that he preferred an internal revolution. In March 2007, speaking at the Secular Islam Summit in St. Petersburg, Florida, he called for the US to help to overthrow the government in Iran by supporting the [...] "silent army" [...] (the internal opposition movements in Iran) via encouragement through media, along with tough economic sanctions on Iran. In an interview with Ynet Fakhravar said that if the West launches a military attack on Iran, [...] "The top brass will flee immediately.

2500|$|John Bowker {{criticized the}} idea that [...] "God" [...] and [...] "Faith" [...] are viruses of the mind, {{suggesting}} that Dawkins' [...] "account of religious motivation ... is ... far removed from evidence and data" [...] and that, even if the God-meme approach were valid, [...] "it does not give rise to one set of consequences ... Out of the many behaviours it produces, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> required to isolate only those that might be regarded as diseased?" [...] Alister McGrath has responded by arguing that [...] "memes {{have no place in}} serious scientific reflection", that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions, that [...] "evolution" [...] of ideas is more Lamarckian than Darwinian, and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas. McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that [...] "if religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, then it cannot be conceivably regarded as analogous to a virus?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 272, Bu Chan, the {{military}} commander stationed at Xiling (西陵), started a rebellion against Wu {{and sent a}} messenger to the Jin dynasty to express his wish to defect to Jin. When Lu Kang received news of the revolt, he immediately gave orders to his subordinates Zuo Yi (左奕), Wu Yan (吾彥), Cai Gong (蔡貢) and others to lead separate forces and head towards Xiling via shortcuts. He instructed his men to construct defensive structures {{all the way from}} Chixi (赤谿) to Gushi (故市) so as to form an encirclement around Bu Chan's position, {{while at the same time}} defending the area from attacks by Jin forces. He ordered them to work day and night to complete the construction works as if the enemy had already arrived, and his soldiers were all tired and worn out. Lu Kang's subordinates said, [...] "With our current strength, we can attack Bu Chan and destroy him before Jin forces arrive. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> exhausting ourselves by constructing defensive structures instead?" [...] Lu Kang replied, [...] "Xiling's fortifications are very stable and it has sufficient supplies. Besides, I was the one who oversaw the construction of Xiling's defences. If we attack it now, I don't think we can conquer it easily. If Jin forces show up and we don't have adequate defensive structures, we'll be trapped in between Bu Chan and Jin and have nothing to protect ourselves from the enemy." [...] The officers repeatedly urged Lu Kang to attack Xiling but Lu refused. Eventually, Lei Tan (雷譚), the Administrator (太守) of Yidu (宜都), came to see Lu Kang and used kind words to persuade him to attack Xiling. To prove that he was right, Lu Kang relented and ordered an assault on Xiling. As he expected, they did not succeed in capturing the city, so his officers gave up their idea of attacking and complied with Lu Kang's orders to construct the defensive structures.|$|E
