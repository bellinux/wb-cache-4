I thought okay, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is shoot about fifty sequences, cut it into something coherent and pacey, and made it on {{the same sort of}} thing.

[...] -O'Neal, before the 2008-09 season O'Neal was given jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by Andrea Bargnani. While {{he was expected to}} combine with Toronto's three-time All-Star Chris Bosh to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors, O'Neal's arrival was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk; in the team's second game, Toronto's center blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say [...] "Don't come back here again." [...] Even so, it took O'Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled the big man out for almost a quarter of Toronto's games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under [...]500, Toronto General Manager Bryan Colangelo looked to move O'Neal to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space.|$|E

Armstrong reported Sian would be set for heartache before her departure as Sophie would embark on a relationship with Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel). Parkinson said she was sad, but excited for her final storyline, which would feature Sian and Sophie's wedding day. Of her departure, Parkinson told the Press Association, [...] "I'm very sad but I'm very excited.

She added: [...] "But I only live round the corner so I'll be popping in every day". As Sian and Sophie prepare for their wedding, Kevin questions Sophie about her feelings for Sian. Sophie tells him she is {{doing the right thing}} in getting married. During the ceremony, Sian says her vows with conviction and feeling, but Sophie stammers her way through her vows. Sian senses Sophie's doubts, about their pending marriage, and runs away from the church totally distraught. Sophie returns to her home, to find Sian heartbroken, and packing her belongings with the intent to leave Sophie and Weatherfield. Sophie sobs to Sian that she had nerves, and that she desperately wants to marry her. Sian has a change of heart, and agrees to get married. But soon after this, Sian overhears Sophie explaining to Amber, that she regrets kissing her, and saying she loved her. Sian is completely devastated by this infidelity, as she trusted Sophie, but now says, she hates her.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Oral {{endocrine}} therapy (OET) {{is standard}} therapy {{for millions of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer survivors (ER+BCS). OET reduces recurrence, mortality, and metastasis. ER+BCS often do not take their OET as recommended due to adverse side effects. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop an explanatory framework of decision making by women with ER+ breast cancer who report experiencing side effects from OET. This project was comprised of two components. The first component was a systematic review with three main findings: (1) side effects negatively impact OET non-adherence, (2) there is an absence of decisional supports provided to or available for ER+BCS who are experiencing OET side effects,, and (3) ER+BCS likely have unmet decisional needs related to OET. The second component was a grounded theory study that included 31 ER+BCS reporting OET side effects. During a single semi-structured interview, participants described the experience of OET over time. This study produced two qualitatively derived projects. First, a theoretical framework was developed that depicted four stages through which the experience of OET decision making unfolded. The stages were (1) being told <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to live, (2) doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to live, (3) enduring <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to live, and (4) deciding how I want to live. Second, a typology was developed that depicted six sources of external decisional supports (healthcare providers, husbands, other breast cancer survivors, friends and family, the internet and other media sources, and God) that met four types of decisional needs (information about OET and its side effects, in-depth discussions about side effects, help in managing side effects, and emotional support). Findings {{can be used to}} develop interventions, such as decision aids, to promote quality decision making in women experiencing OET side effects. 1 yea...|$|E

30|$|We also removed {{two items}} {{perceived}} as inappropriate for the decision-making context around abortion. We removed the initially adapted item, ‘Telling me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for my abortion’, {{because it was}} perceived to be too directive in this context. Also, participants generally felt it was redundant to ‘Working out a plan for my abortion with me’, which they preferred. As one participant explained, ‘Telling me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for my abortion’ seemed only about what the patient needs to do, whereas ‘Working out a plan for my abortion with me’ felt more like a balanced exchange about both the patient’s and provider’s responsibilities (# 3). We also removed the initially adapted item, ‘Taking my preferences about my abortion seriously’, because there was consistent confusion about what ‘preferences’ {{referred to in the}} abortion decision-making process. Participants often assumed it meant preferences for whether to have an abortion instead of about the abortion method. Some participants also shared that they knew nothing about abortion before speaking with the abortion counselor, so they did not have any preferences and therefore felt that they would have had a hard time answering this item. In addition, this item became redundant to the initially adapted item ‘Listening to what mattered to me about my abortion’, which was perceived by several participants to encompass engagement with preferences.|$|E
