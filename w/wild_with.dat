5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core theme in the series' development.|$|E

5|$|The giraffe has {{intrigued}} various cultures, both {{ancient and}} modern, for its peculiar appearance, and {{has often been}} featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the <b>wild,</b> <b>with</b> around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside <b>wild,</b> <b>with</b> a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E

5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued {{for most of}} the summer and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all called on to give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived as a result of rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

25|$|Salmon need other salmon {{to survive}} {{so they can}} {{reproduce}} and pass on their genes in the <b>wild.</b> <b>With</b> some populations endangered, precautions are necessary to prevent overfishing and habitat destruction, including appropriate management of hydroelectric and irrigation projects.

25|$|The Fisheries Agency and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government {{operate a}} {{conservation}} facility {{on the edge}} of Futami Harbor. Eggs are carefully planted in the shore and infant turtles are raised at the facility until they have reached a certain size, at which point they are released into the <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> an identification tag. Today the number of green turtles has been stabilized and is increasing slowly.|$|E

25|$|Naked and Afraid is {{an active}} series that first premiered on June 23, 2013. One man and one woman are thrown alone into the <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> nothing and left to survive.

Focus on the Family's PluggedIn gave it a critical review. Parents Television Council, One Million Moms, and American Family Association have boycotted the network.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, the Arabian oryx was relisted as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN Red List. The IUCN estimated more than 1,000 Arabian oryx in the <b>wild,</b> <b>with</b> 6,000–7,000 held in captivity worldwide in zoos, preserves, and private collections. Some {{of these are}} in large, fenced enclosures (free-roaming), including those in Syria (Al Talila), Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE. This {{is the first time}} the IUCN has reclassified a species {{as vulnerable}} after it had been listed as extinct in the wild. The Arabian oryx is also listed in CITES Appendix I.|$|E

25|$|Big Bertha {{gained a}} strong {{reputation}} {{on both sides}} of the lines due to its early successes in smashing the forts at Liege. The German press went <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> enthusiasm and declared the Bertha a Wunderwaffe. Later during the German assault upon Verdun in February 1916, it proved less effective, as the newer construction of this fort, consisting of concrete reinforced with steel, could mostly withstand the large semi-armour-piercing shells of the Berthas. Only Fort Vaux was severely damaged during this event, destroying the water storage and leading to the surrender of the fort.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the birds}} are not {{classified}} as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained {{to do so and}} the animal must {{be able to do this}} without human assistance: it must also be shown that {{the birds are}} able to do this in the <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> no experience, just on their own intelligence. But even when an animal is trained to do this, it is still unknown if they are self-aware, or are just repeating the same movements and commands that they were taught so that they may receive a treat as a reward after they have correctly completed their task.|$|E
25|$|There {{may still}} be some {{surviving}} South China tigers in the <b>wild,</b> <b>with</b> reports of tracks and local people sightings from Qizimei Mountains Nature Reserve, Hubei Province and in Yihuang county of Jiangxi Province. In May 2007, the Government of China reported to the CITES Secretariat {{that there is no}} confirmed presence, and declared the goal to reintroduce South China tigers to the wild. In September 2007, a body of an Asiatic black bear was found in Zhenping County that had possibly been killed and eaten by a South China tiger. In October 2007, a supposed South China tiger attacked a cow in the same county.|$|E
