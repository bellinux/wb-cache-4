Although the role of <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> has become increasingly important, little隨著臺灣地區快速的經濟發展和工業化，農村人口逐漸移向都市而使得農村人口 老化及婦女化。雖然農村婦女在農業經營上的角色日益重要，有關臺灣地區農村婦女其飲食 習慣、生活型態以及營養知識和狀態的研究則甚少。 本研究共調查了 928 位從事水稻、花 卉、水果或蔬菜栽培工作之已婚農村婦女。由調查結果得知有 36 ％的農村婦女不知何謂食 物之五大類或均衡飲食，顯示臺灣地區婦女的營養教育仍有待加強。 在飲食習慣方面， 有 1 / 4 的農村婦女三餐沒有定時及定量。雖然多數婦女平均每月只參加不超過一次的宴席，但...|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1996 Dr. Ruth LiepinsThis thesis argues that the multiple geographies of political practice are an important feature of activism. It investigates the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> movement, which is an informally connected web of groups and events working to increase the recognition and participation of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Australian <b>agriculture.</b> By approaching agriculture as a political and social activity, as well as and economic one, the study demonstrates diverse relations to place, in the mobilisation of the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> movement. The thesis argues that the movement is challenging Australian agriculture through actions over a variety of sites, scales and spheres. The thesis sets out to explain the development and impact of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> activism. <b>In</b> doing so it studies both the contexts and effects of the movement. Multiple dimensions of the movement’s contexts are examined: agricultural, political, discursive and locational dimensions are shown to have shaped its development and character. These dimensions have then been challenged by the movement as it acts on its agenda of recognition and participation. Three case groups within the movement were investigated to demonstrate the personal, farm and public scales at which the activism of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> has had an impact. First, the individual and collective agency of participants, at a personal level, is noted as women negotiate diverse subject positions and experience the collective relational aspects of ‘movement politics’. Second, {{the impact of the}} movement is analysed {{at the level of the}} farm unit where it challenges many of the conventional arrangements operating within family farms. Third, the movement’s impact is described within a number of spheres of agricultural and community affairs. It is argued that the movement applied specific political strategies to farmer, industry, media and state spheres which resulted in the varying success of their goals for women’s increased recognition and participation <b>in</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Analysis of the multiple geographies of activism illustrated by the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> movement reveals the political and discursive processes that operate to construct family farming. Moreover, it demonstrates the impact of activism where a movement strategically operates in multiple places and spaces to effect the social change and desires. Open Acces...|$|R

Urban agriculture holds promise at solving these intractable problems. Urban agriculture is a practice that takes place in all urban centres, but existing studies have not succinctly examined the involvement of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> <b>in</b> small urban centres of Nigeria. The aim of this paper therefore, is to examine the motives behind involvement of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> <b>in</b> small agro-towns of Kwara State, Nigeria. A total of 1, 801 women farmers were selected from 13 settlements cutting across 8 LGAs. Simple percentages, graphic illustrations, charts, tabulation and cross tabulation and stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the generated data. The study identifies three factors: food security, income supplement and accessibility to land, accounting for 98. 6 % as the best predictors of <b>women</b> involvement <b>in</b> urban <b>agriculture.</b> The study recommends that urban agriculture should be given official recognition by advocating for its support while women should be provided with financial resources to expand their farm plots...|$|R
