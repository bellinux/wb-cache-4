500|$|The author recounted how he {{initially}} {{had felt the}} 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign would be looked back on in retrospect as a brief humorous period of hysteria {{on the part of}} the American populace. He realized, [...] "It turned out to be something a lot darker and crazier than that." [...] Taibbi said of his book, [...] "Insane Clown President is the story of how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> to the beginning of our next long national nightmare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Making {{his debut}} against Australia at Lord's in 1975, he {{got lost in}} the {{pavilion}} as he went out to bat. Steele went down one too many flights of stairs and found himself in the basement toilets. He managed to make the field of play without becoming the first Test batsman to be timed out. Once he did arrive at the crease, fast bowler Jeff Thomson gave him a typically Australian welcome. Eyeing Steele's prematurely greying hair at 33, Thomson asked: [...] "Bloody hell, who've <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> Groucho Marx?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Tripoli was {{occupied}} unopposed on 13 October by the 7th (Meerut) Division led once {{again by the}} XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery following Bulfin's orders for {{the continuation of the}} coastal advance northwards. The leading column was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a [...] march over mountain passes and sand. [...] "Felt absolutely done up when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> and at times felt like lying down and giving in as I feel as if my very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all."

2500|$|Leader of the Opposition and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said [...] that [...] "Chris Alexander {{has a lot}} {{to answer}} for, but that’s not where we are right now. We’re worried about how <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>here,</b> how the {{collective}} international response has been so defective, how Canada has failed so completely." [...] NDP MP Fin Donnelly was accused of using the tragic event as a means to garner votes, because he initially told reporters that he had personally handed a letter to Immigration Minister Chris Alexander urging the minister to look at the refugee application of Alan Kurdi's family, but that Canadian immigration authorities denied the family's application. However, later the aunt of Alan Kurdi revealed that the application was made only for Kurdi's uncle and was rejected because it was not complete. Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office clarified that they had not received the proper documentation to certify refugee status for the uncle's family. Mulcair later defended Donnelly, saying that no apology was warranted because the letter had mentioned both families, and stated that he [...] "couldn’t be prouder to have someone of the strength, integrity and hard work as Fin Donnelly" [...] in caucus.|$|E
