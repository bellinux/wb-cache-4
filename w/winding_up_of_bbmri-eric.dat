40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> a {{commercial}} company with liquidation. It {{consists of two}} parts [...] theoretical (chapters 2 to 5) and practical (chapter 6). In the theoretical part I start with introduction into the issue (legal background, basic concepts) and then I write about the reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> a commercial company. Furthermore I focus on liquidation, the company liquidator and the liquidation process itself. I also briefly mention the procedure in case <b>of</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> an insolvent company. In the practical part I show on {{an example of a}} particular commercial company how would its liquidation look like. We can see what steps the associates and the liquidator have to take between the decision about <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the company and its erasure from the Companies register...|$|R

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} (theory) I tried to draw up the legal background <b>of</b> the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the commercial company, then I aimed to general aspects <b>of</b> the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation (general reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> liquidator, insolvency proceeding), specifics <b>of</b> the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation appertaining to particular type of commercial company and finally I described the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the company with the legal successor (legal forms of conversions). In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process <b>of</b> <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> <b>of</b> the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R
