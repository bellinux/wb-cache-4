5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E

Pohren described de Lucía as [...] "extremely timid and retiring", saying that, [...] "Being a very private person, [...] was dismayed at the ensuing popularity and lionization, and the increased pressure fame placed upon his shoulders, demanding that he constantly innovate and <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> achieve technical and revolutionary perfection." ...|$|E

His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out.

500|$|In the 2008–09 season, Nasri {{appeared}} in only three matches {{with the national}} team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. I told myself I need to <b>work</b> <b>harder,</b> <b>to</b> make sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E
500|$|Bear McCreary {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary {{to work with a}} full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for [...] "important" [...] episodes. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score [...] "a modern edge". Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was [...] "a sense that it had to connect" [...] to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] but also [...] "intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people." [...] McCreary had to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted [...] "the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation." ...|$|E

[...] In 2013, Campbell joined fellow black models Iman and Bethann Hardison in an advocacy group called [...] "Diversity Coalition".

2500|$|The EBU {{announced}} that they would <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bring back Austria, Italy, and Monaco to the 2010 Contest.

[...] An average length back still allows a horse to perform ambling gaits, though a very short-coupled horse usually can only perform the trot. A well-laid back {{shoulder}} and somewhat horizontal hip angle favor a longer length of stride and is helpful in horses that fox trot, while a steeper shoulder angle combined with more sloping croup produce a stride more desirable in some lateral gaits such as the running walk.|$|E

2500|$|However, Edgar Böhm, {{director}} of entertainment for ORF, {{said that the}} semi-final format [...] "still incorporates a mix of countries who will be politically favoured in the voting process" [...] and [...] "that, unless a clear guideline {{as to how the}} semifinals are organised is made by the EBU, Austria will not be taking part in Moscow 2009". ORF decided not to participate in the 2009 contest, but did broadcast the final as in 2008. The EBU announced that they would <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bring Austria back to the contest in 2010, along with former participants Monaco and Italy. It was, however, confirmed that Austria would not participate in the 2010 Contest in Oslo. In July 2010, the chairman of ORF, Alexander Wrabetz, stated that Austria would return for the 2011 contest, due to it being held in its neighbour Germany. In 2011, Austria reached the final {{for the first time since}} 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emergence}} of the new organizational strategies {{can be seen in}} the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders [...] "to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated [...] "get-out-the-vote" [...] drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.|$|E
