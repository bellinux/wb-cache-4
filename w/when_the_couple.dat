5|$|By 1914 Olivia {{seems to}} have {{realised}} that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less than he had in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914.

5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August.

5|$|In 1929, Ernest O. Thompson, a {{decorated}} World War I general {{and a major}} businessman in Amarillo, was elected mayor to succeed Lee Bivins. Thompson instituted a major capital-improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates. He joined the Texas Railroad Commission by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, and 1958. He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation.

After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8.

5|$|During {{his second}} term as {{representative}} from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure {{her that he was}} giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.|$|E

30|$|In the {{presence}} of delays many different cluster state attractors can coexist. The dynamics settle down onto a periodic orbit with clusters reaching threshold and sending pulses alternately [165 – 167]. Under the addition of weak noise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> is inhibitory, <b>the</b> dynamics stay near this periodic orbit indicating that all cluster state attractors are stable [167]. However, the collective behaviour shows a marked difference <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupling</b> is excitatory. In this case, weak noise is sufficient to drive the system away from the periodic orbit and results in persistent switching between unstable (Milnor) attractors.|$|R
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} proved difficult, as {{the couple}} did not particularly like each other. There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, {{but it was}} not specified <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> would actually take possession of them. It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain. Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131. Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August. It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey {{at a meeting of the}} King's great council in September. The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his {{alliance}} with Fulk of Anjou, {{this time by}} marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, Geoffrey. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles {{as part of her}} dowry, it was not specified <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly like each other and the disputed castles proved a point of contention, resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, Henry and Geoffrey, in 1133 and 1134.|$|E
40|$|We {{find the}} {{evolution}} of arbitrary excitations on 2 -charge supertubes, by mapping the supertube to a string carrying traveling waves.
