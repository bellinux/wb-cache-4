According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E

25|$|Known as “The Wonder Horse” and “King of the Wild Horses,” Rex {{was a black}} Morgan {{stallion}} with {{a fierce}} reputation.

Few actors were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the wild horse, so a double was often used in close-ups. He was the first horse to star in his own films.|$|E

In Tunisia, however, some pro-German Destour leaders had been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the Third Reich, despite Bourguiba's persistent warnings. After the war, Bourguiba's American connections managed to clear him of false charges {{that he was a}} collaborator.

25|$|In 1932 the Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, {{after the}} failure of the three Round Table Conferences (India) in London, now confronted Gandhi's Congress in action. The India Office told Willingdon that he should conciliate only those {{elements}} of Indian opinion that were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the Raj. That did not include Gandhi and the Indian National Congress, which launched its Civil Disobedience Movement on 4 January 1932. Therefore, Willingdon took decisive action. He imprisoned Gandhi. He outlawed the Congress; he rounded up all members of the Working Committee and the Provincial Committees and imprisoned them; and he banned Congress youth organisations. In total he imprisoned 80,000 Indian activists. Without most of their leaders, protests were uneven and disorganised, boycotts were ineffective, illegal youth organisations proliferated but were ineffective, more women became involved, and there was terrorism, especially in the North-West Frontier Province. Gandhi remained in prison until 1933. Willingdon relied on his military secretary, Hastings Ismay, for his personal safety.|$|E
25|$|Barnave {{remained}} {{the most important}} advisor and supporter of the queen, who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> him {{as long as he}} met her demands, which he did to a large extent. Barnave and the moderates comprised about 260 lawmakers in the new Legislative Assembly; the radicals numbered around 136, and the rest around 350. Initially, the majority was with Barnave, but the queen's policies led to the radicalization of the Assembly and the moderates lost control of the legislative process. The moderate government collapsed in April 1792 {{to be replaced by a}} radical majority headed by the Girondins. The Assembly then passed a series of laws concerning the Church, the aristocracy and the formation of new national guard units; all were vetoed by Louis XVI. While Barnave's faction had dropped to 120 members, the new Girondin majority controlled the legislative assembly with 330 members. The two strongest members of that government were Jean Marie Roland, who was minister of interior, and General Dumouriez, the minister of foreign affairs. Dumouriez sympathised with the royal couple and wanted to save them; however, he was rebuffed by the queen.|$|E

500|$|The {{disbanding}} of Masyumi left Fakih {{with more}} time {{to focus on the}} Muhammadiyah, serving as the Second Deputy Chair under Junus Anis. During a leadership course run by the organisation during Ramadhan of 1380 AH (February/March 1961), Fakih began promoting an institutional identity through his lecture [...] "Apakah Muhammadiyah Itu" [...] ("What is Muhammadiyah?"). This outlined the organisation as one based in dawah, focusing on real-world issues, and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the government to ensure a prosperous future for Muslims. These concepts were later formulated through 1962 and established as an institutional identity, one which called for Muhammadiyah to work towards creating a truly Islamic society while opposing leftist politics. This, in turn, was followed by refactoring within the organisation to better adapt the new identity.|$|E

He was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Bramantyo, as he found that the latter had proven to be a skilled director of religious films through his earlier work. Filming began on 5 January 2011 in Semarang; Bramantyo later described the city as a good example of tolerance in action. The film reportedly cost Rp 5 billion ($600,000) to produce. Two songs by the Indonesian band Sheila on 7, [...] "Pasti Kubisa" [...] ("Sure I Can") and [...] "Kamus Hidupku" [...] ("Dictionary to My Life") were used in the soundtrack, while Satrio Budiono and Saft Daultsyah handled sound editing.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigations}} and surveillance would, in part, assess how the anti-Vietnam War movement could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also {{anticipated that the}} Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a private investigation firm led by former Department of Justice officials who had served under Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat and former Attorney General. Caulfield noted that this firm {{had the potential to}} employ [...] "formidable and sophisticated" [...] intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it. The plan would involve black bag operations, targeting political enemies of the campaign. Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to scrutinize the private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits. The Sandwedge proposal also included a list of people <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of Inland Revenue, and a former sheriff of Cook County, Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{was set to}} star in a {{film version}} of The Yearling for 1942, but on-set {{difficulties}} and bad weather forced the production to close.

Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for Woman of the Year, saying [...] "I was just damned grateful he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> me."

William Boehnel wrote in the New York World-Telegram, [...] "To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable.
