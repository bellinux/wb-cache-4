Grugidj sub-totems included pelican, parrot, mopoke and large kangaroo. Gamadj sub-totems included emu, whip snake, possum, koala, and sparrowhawk.

25|$|During {{the gold}} rush period the Djab <b>wurrung</b> saw large numbers of European and Chinese people camping on their land in search for gold, but the search for gold also {{attracted}} many station hands, and so Djab <b>wurrung</b> people often found employment as station hands and in menial jobs around the stations during this period.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} the Djab <b>wurrung</b> {{were well aware}} of Europeans from their {{communications}} with coastal tribes. Their first explicit contact was with Major Thomas Mitchell exploring western Victoria in September 1836 when he surprised two women of the Utoul balug and their children near Mount Cole. Two years later, in 1838, a squatter invasion began with colonials and their sheep flocks settling in Djab <b>wurrung</b> country.|$|E
25|$|The Djab <b>wurrung</b> {{language}} shared 85 percent common vocabulary with Yartwatjali, 82 with Wemba-Wemba, 66% with Madhi Madhi and 68% with Letji-Letji.|$|E

25|$|The Djab <b>wurrung,</b> also Tjapwurrung, {{people are}} Indigenous Australians who occupy the {{volcanic}} plains of central Victoria from the Mount William Range of Gariwerd {{in the west}} to the Pyrenees range in the east encompassing the Wimmera River flowing north and the headwaters of the Hopkins River flowing south. The towns of Ararat, Stawell and Hamilton are within their territory. There were 41 Djab <b>wurrung</b> clans who formed an alliance with the neighboring Jardwadjali people through intermarriage, shared culture, trade and moiety system.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s the Djab <b>wurrung</b> {{were largely}} {{dispersed}} to the reservations: the Hamilton mob to Lake Condah, the Wickcliffe people to Framlingham mission, and the Mount Cole people to Framlingham and Coranderrk station.|$|E

25|$|By 1845 the Djab <b>Wurrung</b> {{population}} had {{dropped from a}} conservative pre-contact estimate of 2050 to 615. Three quarters are estimated to {{have been killed by}} introduced diseases, poisoned flour, diseased blankets and starvation due to shortage of traditional foods, and a quarter killed by rifle attack.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Djab <b>wurrung</b> clans {{are thought}} to have practiced burial of their dead in trees. According to Hyett there have been two recent discoveries to the west of Ararat of {{secondary}} tree burials, involving the re-interment of two or more individuals, and a primary interment of a child in a hollow tree in the vicinity of Stawell.|$|E
25|$|European Settlement from 1836 {{was marked}} by {{resistance}} to the invasion often by driving off or stealing sheep which then resulted in conflict and sometimes a massacre of aboriginal people. From 1840 to 1859 {{there were reports of}} 35 massacres and killings of Djab <b>wurrung</b> people, most occurring before the end of 1842. Very few of these reports were acted upon to bring the settlers to court.|$|E
25|$|Though lost to history, many {{traditional}} forms of recreation were played and while these varied from tribe to tribe, there were often similarities. Ball games were quite popular and played by tribes across Australia, as were games based on use of weapons. There is extensive documented evidence of traditional football games being played. Perhaps the most documented is a game popularly played by tribes in western Victorian regions of the Wimmera, Mallee and Millewa by the Djab <b>wurrung,</b> Jardwadjali and Jarijari people. Known as Marn Grook, it was a type of kick and catch football game played with a ball made of possum hide, the existence of which was corroborated in accounts from European eyewitnesses and depicted in illustration. According to some accounts, it was played {{as far away as}} the Yarra Valley by the Wurundjeri people, Gippsland by the Gunai people, and the Riverina in south-western New South Wales. Since the 1980s it has been speculated that Marn Grook influenced Australian rules football, however there is no direct evidence in its favour.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1980s, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Wills played or observed an Aboriginal football game, Marngrook, as a child growing up in the Grampians among the Djab <b>wurrung,</b> and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The theory has provoked intense debate, amounting to a controversy dubbed [...] "football's history wars". In her essay [...] "A Seductive Myth", published in the AFL's The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), Hibbins calls the proposed link an [...] "emotional belief" [...] lacking [...] "any intellectual credibility". She points out that neither Wills nor any of his fellow football founders mention Aboriginal games in existing documents, and states that there is no evidence of Marngrook being played in the vicinity where Wills grew up. Since then, among the personal papers of ethnographer Alfred William Howitt, an interview has been found with a Mukjarrawaint man who recalls playing Marngrook in the Grampians. Also, in his first-hand account of Aboriginal games, James Dawson, an Aboriginal rights activist, records the Djab <b>wurrung</b> word for football as [...] "Min'gorm". De Moore therefore argues that Marngrook was likely played around where Wills lived as a boy, [...] "or, at the very least, that the local Aboriginal people knew of such a game". That Wills knew of Marngrook, he adds, is speculative at best.|$|E
500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the common}} name [...] "emu" [...] is uncertain, but {{is thought to have}} come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in Australia and New Guinea. Another theory is that it comes from the word [...] "ema", which is used in Portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane. In Victoria, some terms for the emu were Barrimal in the Dja Dja <b>Wurrung</b> language, myoure in Gunai, and courn in Jardwadjali. The birds were known as murawung or birabayin to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.|$|E
500|$|Wills {{travelled}} inland in November {{to convene}} the players from Edenhope and Harrow, where they worked as station hands. One of their employers, William Hayman, acted as the team's manager and [...] "protector". They were mostly Jardwadjali men who shared common vocabulary with the neighbouring Djab <b>wurrung</b> people, which enabled Wills {{to use the}} Aboriginal language he learnt as a child. From their training ground at Lake Wallace, Wills, in a [...] "tactical strike", boasted to the Melbourne press of the Aborigines' powers, especially the batsmanship of Unamurriman, commonly known as Mullagh. In a response that drew widespread criticism, the MCC strengthened its ranks with non-members. Public sympathy was with the Aborigines when they arrived in Melbourne and over 10,000 spectators attended the MCG on Boxing Day to see them play. Captained by Wills, they lost the match, but won praise for their performance. Wills afterwards accused the MCC of [...] "treachery".|$|E
500|$|Living under canvas, the Wills family {{took up the}} leases of a large {{property}} named Lexington (near present-day Moyston) in an area used by Djab <b>wurrung</b> Aboriginal clans as {{a meeting}} place. According to family members, Tom, as an only child, [...] "was thrown much into the companionship of aborigines". In an account of corroborees from childhood, his cousin H. C. A. Harrison remembered Tom's ability to learn Aboriginal songs, mimic their voice and gestures, and [...] "speak their language as fluently as they did themselves, much to their delight." [...] It is speculated that Tom may have also played Aboriginal sports. Horatio wrote fondly of his son's kinship with Aborigines, and allowed local clans to live and hunt on Lexington. However, George Augustus Robinson, the district's Chief Protector of Aborigines, implicated Horatio and other local settlers {{in the murder of}} Aborigines. Horatio blamed [...] "distant predatory tribes" [...] for provoking hostilities in the area, and the closest he came to admitting that he had killed Aborigines was in a letter to Governor Charles La Trobe: [...] "... we shall be compelled in self defence to measures that may involve us in unpleasant consequences".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that a {{traditional}} ball-kicking aboriginal game such as Marn Grook had some influence on the formation of Australian Rules Football. Ashley Mallett suggests the form played among Wimmera tribes might have been one influence, and cites a passage from the pastoralist and aboriginal rights activist James Dawson on how the Djab <b>Wurrung</b> played the game, using a stitched possum skin for the football: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{team was}} initially coached by local pastoralist William Hayman. Coaching duties were later {{turned over to}} Tom Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team and founder of Australian rules football, who spoke to the team in an Aboriginal language he learnt as {{a child growing up}} in the Western District among the Djab <b>Wurrung</b> people. Wills' decision to join and help the team {{has been a source of}} intrigue, given that only five years earlier, he survived a massacre in Queensland in which his father and 18 other settlers were murdered by local Aborigines. [...] "It was always a matter of wonder how Tom could be friendly with the blacks, considering that they murdered his father", recalled one sportswriter.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{references}} to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland. There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman. On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab <b>Wurrung</b> for [...] "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: [...] "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." [...] Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.|$|E

50|$|The {{classification}} {{of the groups}} on this territory has been subject to controversy. Norman Tindale, referring to the same area, and clans, called them the Kirrae, whose lands he stated comprised in his estimate around 1,900 sq. miles of territory from Warrnambool and the Hopkins River down to the coast at Princetown with the northerly reaches at Lake Bolac and Darlington, and extending easterly beyond Camperdown. The historian Ian Clark states that Tindale 'failed to acknowledge the existence' of the Djargurd <b>wurrung,</b> while locating {{them in the same}} area. The Djagurd <b>wurrung</b> territory was bordered by the Wada <b>wurrung</b> in the north, the Dhauwurd <b>wurrung</b> to the west, the Girai <b>wurrung</b> to their south, and the Gulidjan in the east.|$|E
