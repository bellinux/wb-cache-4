[...] Sensing his own doom, he told the journalists accompanying him on the flight, [...] "You have to be very ready <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of a three or four minutes it could be all over, you know, and [...] I {{may not be able to}} talk to you again after this." [...] His last televised interview, with journalist Jim Laurie, took place on the flight just prior to his assassination.|$|E
