Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> like if alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> worth.|$|E

500|$|Thief: The Dark Project {{has been}} {{declared}} {{one of the greatest}} games of all time by several publications. Inducting it into its hall of fame, GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote: [...] "With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every [...] action game at that time, Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault," [...] continuing: [...] "While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters, it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre." [...] GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that, while Metal Gear Solid, [...] and Thief all defined the stealth action genre, it was Thief that displayed [...] "the purest depiction of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> like to slip from shadow to shadow" [...] and [...] "largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming." [...] In 2009, Thief was added to IGN's hall of fame. Sid Shuman, writing for GamePro, asserted that Thief [...] "pioneered its own genre ... the stealth-action title." [...] John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review: [...] "Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games, each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original." [...] In 2012, Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief [...] "the best stealth game I've ever played", superior to modern games in the genre. That same year, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.|$|E

[...] In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: [...] "While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon."

2500|$|The {{inability}} to choose and design the character the player played {{as in the}} game was both commended and criticised. The YouTube channel Extra Credits commended Rust for promoting diversity {{in the way in}} which the game decides for the player their in-game race; by randomly selecting a player's race and tying it to their Steam ID, the game can force players to experience the game as a different race than they would normally experience, thereby promoting a greater level of empathy for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> like to be someone of different ethnicity than the player. The lack of communication between Facepunch and the community when adding female models was criticised by David Craddock (Shacknews), where he mentions he understands Facepunch's reasoning behind the lack of options but the way they implemented it could've been more effective if the communication was better. In response to the criticism, Garry Newman commented that he had felt some trepidation towards adding the racial feature, fearing that it might be seen as just the original character model [...] "blacked up", and stressed how the chosen ethnicity was permanent as [...] "just like in real life, you are who you are". Garry Newman discussed the reasoning behind not giving the option to choose the gender and race of the player's character in an article on The Guardian, saying Rust is about survival, not characterization and identity. When female models were added, sales reportedly increased by 74%.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
