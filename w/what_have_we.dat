500|$|American {{composer}} Michael Kamen, who {{had contributed}} to The Wall, oversaw the orchestral arrangements. He also stood in for absent keyboardist Richard Wright, co-produced, and mediated between Waters and Gilmour. James Guthrie was employed as the studio engineer and co-producer, while Mason's drumming was supplemented by Ray Cooper, and when unable to perform the complex timing changes required of him, replaced on [...] "Two Suns in the Sunset" [...] by Andy Newmark. It was Mason who suggested the repeated reprises of [...] "Maggie, <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>we</b> done" [...] be rendered instrumental rather than sung. Raphael Ravenscroft was hired to play the saxophone. Recording {{took place in the}} latter half of 1982 across eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at Hookend Manor, and Waters' Billiard Room Studios at East Sheen. [...] The other venues were Mayfair Studios, Olympic Studios, Abbey Road Studios, Eel Pie Studios, Audio International and RAK Studios.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>we</b> done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you should have seen it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (<b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>we</b> done) achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 2,000 {{students}} {{accompanied the}} team to Chicago, and an account from Chicago was relayed to Ann Arbor's Athens theater which was [...] "packed with students and citizens." [...] When the final score was announced, the crowd of 1,500 voices sung, [...] "Oh! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>we</b> done? [...] Oh! [...] <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>we</b> done? We have put Wisconsin on the bum. That's what we have done." [...] When the Michigan team returned to Ann Arbor late in the evening, they were met by a big delegation that marched behind the bus singing." ...|$|E

2500|$|What was {{critical}} to American values, John Adams insisted, was that the government be [...] "bound by fixed laws, which the people {{have a voice in}} making, and a right to defend."

[...] "I think since we already are in that world, about 70 percent of the Navy's IT infrastructure, we are in a world where the Navy has complete control and authority over how we operate the network. That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from.
