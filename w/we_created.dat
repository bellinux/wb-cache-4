The couple first collaborated on the script of an adaptation of William Faulkner's novel The Hamlet in 1957 (released as The Long, Hot Summer), although Frank later said, [...] "...in the end, <b>we</b> <b>created</b> mostly new material, so it wasn't really a true adaptation".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But <b>we</b> <b>created</b> her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so <b>we</b> <b>created</b> her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt <b>we</b> <b>created,</b> so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so <b>we</b> <b>created</b> our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E

When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into {{the drama of the}} Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes.

500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham <b>we</b> <b>created</b> on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E

500|$|It also {{revealed}} that a mixtape, titled Welcome to the New Administration, was available for download for free on the FriendsOrEnemies website. The mixtape contained several snippets of new Fall Out Boy tracks, {{as well as new}} music from other bands such as Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, and Panic! at the Disco. However none of the titles were confirmed for Folie à Deux. It also featured a song titled [...] "America's Sweethearts" [...] which was eventually confirmed for the album but with an alternate spelling, [...] "America's Suitehearts".

500|$|At E3 2014, a re-release of {{the game}} was {{announced}} for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. This enhanced version features an increased draw distance, finer texture details, denser traffic, upgraded weather effects, and new wildlife and vegetation. It features more than 162 new songs across the game's radio stations. Players may transfer Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression between some platforms and gain exclusive content like activities, weapons and vehicles. The re-release features a new on-foot first-person view option that players may configure to personal preference (for example, by making the view toggle to third-person when taking cover). Animation director Rob Nelson said that a first-person option was raised during PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 development, but their relatively smaller banks of memory were already being pushed, such that adding new first-person animations would have inhibited the open world render. According to Nelson, the first-person view required more development effort than simply repositioning the camera, {{because of the need}} to adapt combat to a different view. The weapons were upgraded to a higher resolution, and new animations including weapon recoil, reload and switch were added. [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>created</b> 3,000 animations on weapons alone", said Nelson.|$|E

He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records <b>we</b> <b>created</b> were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E

Earl said, [...] "In [...] {{it was more like}} an aircraft carrier, now it’s an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We were all over the carriers [...] We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn’t just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all." [...] This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, [...] "The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. <b>We</b> <b>created</b> details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.|$|E
500|$|An {{earthquake}} {{on the sea}} bed—a [...] "seaquake"—could {{have caused}} sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of Mary Celestes cargo, thus releasing noxious fumes. Rising fears of an imminent explosion could plausibly have led Briggs to order the ship's abandonment; the displaced hatches suggest that an inspection, or an attempted airing, had taken place. The New York World of January 24, 1886, drew attention to a case where a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded. The same journal's issue of February 9, 1913, cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels {{as the source of}} gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in Mary Celestes hold. Briggs's cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory as providing a sufficiently alarming scenario—rumblings from the hold, the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion—for Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship. In his haste to leave the ship before it exploded, Briggs may have failed to properly secure the yawl to the tow line. A sudden breeze could have blown the ship away from the occupants of the yawl, leaving them to succumb to the elements. The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case. In 2006 an experiment was carried out for Channel Five television by Andrea Sella of University College, London, the results of which helped to revive the [...] "explosion" [...] theory. Sella built a model of the hold, with paper cartons representing the barrels. Using butane gas, he created an explosion that caused a considerable blast and ball of flame—but contrary to expectation, no fire damage within the replica hold. [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>created</b> was a pressure-wave type of explosion. There was a spectacular wave of flame but, behind it, was relatively cool air. No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching." ...|$|E
