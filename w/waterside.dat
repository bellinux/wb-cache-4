5|$|The town of Chesham grew {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. After the parish was {{transferred}} to the Diocese of Oxford, reforms introduced by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, led to the parish being partitioned, eventually becoming four independent parishes (Chesham, Latimer, <b>Waterside</b> and Ashley Green). In 1980 it was decided to reverse this decision, and over the 1980s and 1990s three of these parishes (Chesham, <b>Waterside</b> and Ashley Green) were reunited under St.Mary's Church.|$|E
40|$|As one of {{the unique}} beauties of Bosporus, Bosporus <b>watersides</b> have been {{composed}} and formed through long ages along the Bosporus. Not only an architectural form and a residential type, the Bosporus <b>watersides</b> also were {{being a part of}} the culture in which they were built. They project the life traditions of the ages in which they were built. Their users were using those buildings as summer resorts, comprised of a hall, wide rooms, kitchen and other components. The gardens of the <b>watersides</b> also have had their own characteristics, and they were setting out unique beauties. The gardens of the <b>watersides</b> in Bosporus were beyond comparison by their organizational schemes and landscape designs. The <b>watersides</b> were designed with a garden within the bounds of spatial possibilities. The gardens were decorated with colorful flowery plants. Many <b>watersides,</b> which were built in Bosporus, have reached until today. As a type of residences, these buildings are among the most important buildings of Bosporus. The Bosporus <b>watersides</b> have unique architectural samples and features {{and they need to be}} well preserved. However, it has been identified that some of those structures have disappeared in time. There are many causes for such a removal. By analyzing these causes, we need to preserve these buildings better nowadays. Bosporus <b>watersides</b> and their gardens today need a better protection by effective policies to be produced. Having unique architectural features and styles, those buildings also are a part of our culture. We must better protect our historical and cultural patterns.

5|$|In 1845 Chesham, {{along with}} the rest of Buckinghamshire, was {{transferred}} from the Diocese of Lincoln, of which for historical reasons it had been a part since the Norman Conquest despite its distance from Lincoln, to the Diocese of Oxford. It thus came under the control of Oxford's newly appointed dynamic young bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who in turn appointed Adolphus Aylward as vicar in 1847 to oversee the reform of the parish. A second church at <b>Waterside</b> was opened in 1867, and the huge parish of Chesham was partitioned between St.Mary's and the new Christ Church, <b>Waterside.</b> As Chesham and the surrounding towns grew following the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway the parish was divided further, leaving a total of four independent parishes: St.Mary's, Christ Church <b>Waterside,</b> St.John the Evangelist Ashley Green, and Latimer At the end of the 19th century the advowson of the much-reduced parish of St.Mary's was acquired by the recently created Peache Trust.|$|E

30|$|Privacy is {{the second}} element in SPECTRUM. In the context of Jakarta, privacy {{concerns}} exist, particularly for the urban poor living in informal settlements or slums situated along the <b>watersides</b> [119].

Though money can quickly incentivise people to forgo their privacy [58], the issues raised above with monetary incentives remain a concern in that context. Rather, it is argued that societal recognition of slum dwellers and their role in community building be strongly emphasised in PetaJakarta campaigns and endorsed by government authorities as an aspect of social incentive to motivate contributions from the millions of Jakarta’s citizens residing in slums. Anonymity should also be encouraged as possibly permitted through the twitter user account.|$|R

40|$|AbstractYamoussoukro, the {{political}} capital of Ivory Coast, {{is characterized by}} ten lakes built in the 1970 s. These lakes cover an area of approximately 140 ha, with a catchment area close to 28. 5 km 2. Since the creation, they lost their aesthetic charm and they are today almost completely flooded by aquatic plants, {{with the exception of}} three lakes. This eutrophication is attributable to the watershed use, and to the activities developed on the <b>watersides</b> and in the neighbouring habitats (domestic waste, oil, sewage, sludge drain). Besides, they are affected by a modification of their water balance, due to hydrological and hydrodynamical modifications, increased sedimentation and physicochemical pollutions. We propose here several complementary strategies for restoring the integrity status of these man-made lakes, protecting water resources and natural environments, in order to improve public health, and contribute to the economic and social development of the neighbouring populations...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{of space}} use {{is central to}} {{understand}} animals' role in ecosystems. The raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides is considered {{as one of the}} most influential alien mesopredator species in Europe, having the potential to cause loss of local biodiversity and act as a vector for zoonotic diseases. We collared 12 animals to study their home range and habitat use in two areas with different management regimes in Estonia: in a protected natural area and in an intensively managed area. From May to October raccoon dogs inhabiting the natural area had considerably smaller home ranges compared to the managed area, 193. 3 ha± 37. 3 SD and 391. 9 ha± 292. 9 SD, respectively. This result contradicts somewhat earlier findings in other European raccoon dog populations, where the home range sizes in natural areas in summer and autumn period have usually been larger compared to managed areas. In both study areas raccoon dogs preferred <b>watersides,</b> where amphibians and other semi-aquatic prey are abundant, to other habitats available in their home ranges. We also studied movements of a raccoon dog pair in the managed study area in winter period. Due to mild weather conditions during the study period, raccoon dogs changed their resting sites quite often, covering a relatively large 599 ha area from November 2012 to January 2013, indicating the absence of usual winter lethargy during the mild winters...|$|R

40|$|Wetland Surface Temperature (WST) {{maps are}} an {{increasingly}} important parameter to understand the extensive range of existing processes in wetlands. The Wetlands placed in neighborhoods of agricultural and industrial lands are exposed to more chemical pollutants and pesticides {{that can lead to}} spatial and temporal variations of their surface temperature. Therefore, more studies are required for temperature modeling and the management and conservation of these variations in their ecosystem. Landsat 8 time series data of Sulduz region, Western Azerbaijan province, Iran were used in this study. The WST was derived using a mono-window algorithm after implementation of atmospheric correction. The NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) threshold method was also employed to determine the surface emissivity. Our findings show that the WST experienced extensive spatial and temporal variations. It reached its maximum value in June and also experienced the highest mean in the same month. In this research, August (2013. 12. 08) had a lowest spatial standard deviation regarding surface temperature and June (2013. 06. 28) had the highest one. Wetlands' <b>watersides</b> adjacent to industrial zones have a higher surface temperature than the middle lands of these places. The map obtained from the WST variance over time can be exploited to reveal thermal stable and unstable zones. The outcome demonstrates that land use, land cover effectively contribute to wetland ecosystem health. The results are useful in the water management, preventive efforts against drying of wetland and evapotranspiration modeling. The approach employed in this research indicates that remote sensing is a valuable, low-cost and stable tool for thermal monitoring of wetlands health...|$|R
40|$|The {{city has}} always been confronting with its own end and the {{beginning}} of the water system. Among the different kind of margin areas, the ones that border the cities on their <b>watersides</b> are particularly interesting. These new liminal territories are rich in variety and differences and are set up of several elements made of different morphologies that should be carefully read and interpreted: the need of re-thinking the morphological elements that mark an urban edge leads to the identification of several shapes and forms of the water borderlands. Borders, limits, boundaries, edges, margin areas - usually considered as an obstacle to the construction of the city - turn themselves as new possible “design materials” for building that ambiguous distance between city and the sea. The article aims to focus on the case-study of Porto’s Marginal that well explain how many ways a city can live its water edges. On a large scale, it is configured as a strip of 15 kilometers of public space. Within this continuity, the different extent of the distance between city and water leads to reflect on the different types of relationships (and therefore projects) between the end of one side {{and the beginning of}} another. For Porto, those are not only urban parts, but also different geographical parts (sea, rivers, topography) that distance puts in relation through the design sometimes of the line, at time of the border or of a surface. So, the analysis of these heterogeneous but continuous projects aim to focus on the several techniques of urban composition to build contemporary public spaces. On one hand they give form to a continuous “public figure”, on the other hand each one of the project can be considered as part of a “atlas” of liminal places, giving form to public spaces.  </p...|$|R
