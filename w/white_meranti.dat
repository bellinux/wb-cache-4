40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Difficulties {{have been}} {{encountered}} in gluing some Southeast Asian woods using phenolic resin. Extractives in veneers from the trade groups yellow, <b>white,</b> and red <b>meranti</b> (Shorea, Parashorea, and Pentacme spp.), keruing (Dipterocarpus spp.), and kapur (Dryobalanops spp.) were suspected {{to be able}} to modify resin cure and to cause inferior gluelines. The average extractive content for veneers of each trade group was determined by sequential extraction with benzene, ether, ethanol, and water. Yellow meranti had the greatest quantity of extractives (15. 6...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a quantitative {{measure of the}} bonding strength of structural silicone sealant applied to wood–double glazing glass joints for wood frame applications. The joint strength is assessed by tensile and shear experimental tests. The paper aims to characterize the joint behaviour through experimental tests in order to implement and validate a ﬁnite element (FE) model of the joint {{that can be used}} for whole frame characterization. The experimental tests are carried out on three wood species (<b>Meranti,</b> <b>White</b> Oak and Pine), and two different FE models of the wood–silicone–glass joint are implemented: the ﬁrst basic model assumes the modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture of the silicone as provided by the manufacturer, while the second model assumes the results of the experimental tensile tests. The results of the ﬁrst FE model do not ﬁt well with the tests carried out, while the second FE model proves to be more reliable and is validated by experimental results. The results report that, when modelling wood–double glazing glass joints by FE methods, the equivalent structural sealant modulus of elasticity assigned in the model should be about 50...|$|R

A fairly large tree up to 40 m tall with bole up to 115 cm diameter. Seeds were dispatched from Thailand and showing 72 % germination and initial moisture content of 20. 3 %. First lot of seeds were dried to moisture content 12. 5 %, 9. 4 % and 6. 1 % respectively. Germination of seeds dried to 6. 1 % m. c. was still relatively high (68 %). Contrary to the desiccation resistance, however, the dried seeds {{seemed not to}} withstand relatively low temperature for Shorea species, i. e. 14 - 16 C.

40|$|The {{plantations}} of Shorea javanica K. &V. (Dipterocarpaceae) in {{the district}} of Krui (Lampung province, Sumatra; see Fig. 1 for situation map and main climatic data) are remarkable examples of successful land development after deforestation and shifting cultivation which was mentioned in the Indonesian forestry literature as far back as 1937 (Rappard 1937). This tree is a <b>white</b> <b>Meranti</b> which is locally found in the natural forest and tapped for its beautiful, crystalline resin, or "damar". The local name of the tree is "Damar Mata Kucing", which means "cat's eye resin". One of the traditional cultivation systems in the area is shifting cultivation ("ladang") : rain-fed rice is grown during one or two years and then coffee, other crops, and damar trees are planted to convert the ladang into a permanent agricultural field. The damar trees close their canopies above the other crops after some years and can be tapped for resin after about 15 years and during a rotation of approximately 50 years. They constitute dense stands of 40 — 50 m high trees called "kebun damar" (damar gardens) which look like a natural rain forest. Seeds for planting stock were formerly obtained from the surrounding natural forest but nowadays they come from the pre-existing plantations which cover an area of approximately 1000 ha (Scholz 1983). Fruiting seasons are occasional and irregular, often several years spaces, so that the farmers manage large nurseries of seedlings which can be maintained for several years and transplanted to the plantations when needed. Transplantation of bare-rooted seedlings is easy. Other useful trees (e. g. clove trees), are simultaneously planted in the ladang at the time of planting the damar trees, so that, although the latter largely dominate, the resulting stand is a multi-layered, mixed one, comprising of different useful plants (fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, etc.). The whole cultivation system, from the shifting cultivation stage to the establishment of a permanent tree plantation, constitutes an efficient agroforestry system which is extensively described by Michon 1984, 1985; Michon et al 1984; and Torquebiau 1984. The resin of Shorea javanica is traditionally used for torches, caulking boats, batik coloring, etc., and is now exported to industrial countries where there is market for uses such as food additives, cosmetics, paints, varnishes...|$|E
