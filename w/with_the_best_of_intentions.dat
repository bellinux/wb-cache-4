Paul Jacobson, the film's producer and a former unit manager for the television program, Howdy Doody, described his film as a [...] "Yuletide science fiction fantasy", and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>intentions,</b> hoped to bring something to movie theaters {{at a time of}} the year when there was a paucity of children's entertainment other than the annual Disney feature.|$|E

At the same time, FID and HN commanders need to recognize when they lack critical resources, or if their rules of engagement are inadequate for a rapidly developing situation. When the on-scene UN commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo Dallaire asked UN headquarters for freedom to act, it was denied due to the interpretation of UN resolutions. Hindsight is always easy, but the catastrophe that took place might have been averted had Dallaire been able to carry out certain actions, including disabling or destroying of broadcast facilities used for inflammatory propaganda, as was done early in Bosnia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} a great {{disappointment}} for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players. According to Wisden, quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had [...] "neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill {{spent a lot of}} time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of Wisden bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: [...] "W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain – but he certainly had a larger experience and a stronger will than the gentleman who, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>intentions,</b> and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886".|$|E

And the Rev. John Meredith forgot to go to bed at all because he was absorbed in reading a life of St. Augustine. It was gray dawn when he finished it and went upstairs, wrestling with the problems of two thousand years ago. The door of the girls' room was open and he saw Faith lying asleep, rosy and beautiful. He wondered where Una was. Perhaps she had gone over to [...] "stay all night" [...] with the Blythe girls. She did this occasionally, deeming it a great treat. John Meredith sighed.
