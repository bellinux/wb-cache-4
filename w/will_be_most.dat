Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Most</b> biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E

One billion people, almost one-seventh of the world's population, now live in shanty towns. In many poor countries overpopulated slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of basic health care. By 2030, over 2 billion {{people in the world}} will be living in slums. Over 90% of the urban population of Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, three of the world's most rural countries, already live in slums.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{engineers}} typically use mechanics in {{the design}} or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were {{the design of a}} vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine.|$|E
25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E

500|$|Globally, {{tropical}} cyclone rainfall {{is more common}} across the northern hemisphere than across the southern hemisphere. [...] This is mainly due to the normal annual {{tropical cyclone}} distribution, as between half and two-thirds of all tropical cyclones form north of the equator. [...] Rainfall is concentrated near the 15th parallel in both hemispheres, with a less steep dropoff seen with latitude across the northern hemisphere, due to the stronger warm water currents seen in that hemisphere which allow tropical cyclones to remain tropical in nature at higher latitudes than south of the equator. [...] In the southern hemisphere, rainfall impacts <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> common between January and March, while north of the equator, tropical cyclone rainfall impacts are more common between June and November. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{said that}} the live CD proved that Madonna is a better singer. A {{reviewer}} from The Buffalo News {{was impressed with the}} release, saying that [...] "This is exactly what you'd expect it to be– a live document of Madonna's most recent tour, which means, essentially, a tour through the dance-based pop music of the past 20 years." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website explained that [...] "though parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret frustrate, it remains a reasonably entertaining program. It probably <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> interesting for Madonna's most serious fans, though. Those in search of the broader titillation of Truth or Dare will leave disappointed." [...] He added that most of the shots in the DVD seemed accurate, time-and-again a softness crept up in the wide angle shots. Jacobson found the performance s shots to be compelling and gave the sound of the DVD a rating of B+. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 49th ceremony in the category Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
