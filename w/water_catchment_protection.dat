Residents are {{suffering}} from the scarcity and cost of water for basic human needs. Based on ethnographic research, over 100 people were consulted on the problems and potential solutions. Women are bearing {{the brunt of the}} burdens as they are responsible for the provision and management of water for domestic purposes. The present system is priced unfairly, is illegal, and unsustainable. Water supply is a significant factor in Labuan Bajo’s inability to attract the type of tourists it deserves and needs. The immediate needs are for regulation of the quality and price of the tanker water that supplies many people in the town. Longer term needs, but require starting as soon as possible, are for <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>protection</b> and water conservation education. Essential to the success of water management in Labuan Bajo is the total overhaul of the state run water supply company, PDAM, and women need to be trained for leadership and monitoring to ensure solutions are enacted and women’s voice on the provision and supply of water is heard...|$|E
40|$|To {{guarantee}} {{protection of}} our drinking <b>water,</b> <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>protections</b> are established. These {{are divided into}} three different zones {{and in the first}} zone it is most likely that an activity, such as agriculture, will contaminate the water resource. Hence the activities are strongly regulated or banned. The EU communion is working towards a sustained water quality through several directives; Nitrate Directive, Waterframwork directives and Sustainable use of pesticide directive. The main purpose is to regulate the diffuse pollution from agriculture. This thesis is about how Denmark, Germany and France are working towards a sustainable agriculture within water protection areas. Sweden is also discussed but mainly about two different methods applied in Linköpings and Ljungbys municipalties. How the different countries work is mainly the same due to the directives. However, there are some interesting water management methods to observe such as voluntary agreements between water companies and farmers. Moreover, the sustainability perspective is approached in a larger scale where you and I as consumers also contribute via consumer-pays-principle. Therefore, we are, by our demand for water, the problem but also the solution and together we can contribute with good social, economic and ecological conditions for ourselves and the farmer...|$|R

40|$|Today Darwin, {{the capital}} city of Australia’s Northern Territory, is a {{tropical}} modern metropolis of 120, 000 people. Darwin’s hinterland displays a complex mixture of rural living; a multi-million dollar horticulture industry; conservation and <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> <b>protection</b> areas; and Aboriginal lands. However, surprisingly this development did not occur through the traditional pattern of the transformation of rural land from agriculture. Darwin shows a startlingly different picture. Most of the lands in the hinterland, even in the 1950 s, were tropical savannas essentially unchanged for thousands of years, except by the Aboriginal traditional owners of the land who hunted and gathered and managed the landscape with fire. The development of Darwin, when mapped using GIS software, shows that counterurbanisation occurred in the 1960 s when the savannas were transformed into rural residential lots. Later agriculture grew out of counterurbanisation from the enterprises of residential hobby farmers. This thesis examines why the development of Darwin departs from the traditional model. Part of the explanation lies in the colonial history of Darwin. Historically Darwin was established as an administrative outpost for firstly the South Australian and later the Commonwealth Government rather than being a city that evolved organically. Land sold to speculators in the 1860 s was not taken up until the 1960 s. Commonwealth experimentation with agriculture continually failed because the environment did not respond to traditional European farming methods. Unlike most tropical savannas in northern Australia, the pastoralists never established a stronghold over Darwin’s hinterland. Finally and significantly, the land in the hinterland was mainly freehold land, while land in the urban area was successively made leasehold through compulsory acquisition by the Commonwealth Government. The implication of this case study of Darwin is that settlement {{does not have to be}} premised on agriculture. Access to freehold land and the capacity to commute aided by the Commonwealth’s tight control of land and housing supply were the initial drivers of counterurbanisation in Darwin...|$|E
40|$|The "Artificial mussel" (AM), a novel passive {{sampling}} technology, {{was used for}} the first time in Australia in freshwater to monitor and assess the risk of trace metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn). AMs were deployed at 10 sites within the Goulburn-Murray <b>Water</b> <b>catchments,</b> Victoria, Australia during a dry year (2009 - 2010) and a wet year (2010 - 2011). Our results showed that the AMs accumulated all the five metals. Cd, Pb, Hg were detected during the wet year but below detection limits during the dry year. At some sites close to orchards, vine yards and farming areas, elevated levels of Cu were clearly evident during the dry year, while elevated levels of Zn were found during the wet year; the Cu indicates localized inputs from the agricultural application of copper fungicide. The impacts from old mines were significantly less compared 'hot spots'. Our study demonstrated that climate variability (dry, wet years) can influence the metal inputs to waterways via different transport pathways. Using the AMs, we were able to identify various 'hot spots' of heavy metals, which may pose a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems (sub-lethal effects to fish) and public (via food chain metal bioaccumulation and biomagnification) in the Goulburn-Murray <b>Water</b> <b>catchments.</b> The State <b>Protection</b> Policy exempted artificial channels and drains from protection of beneficial use (including protection of aquatic ecosystems) and majority of sites ('hot spots') were located within artificial irrigation channels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Perth {{relies on}} {{groundwater}} for 60 % of its water supply. The demand for groundwater raises serious {{concerns for the}} competing users of the resource – the groundwater dependent natural ecosystems, pine plantations, irrigated horticulture, domestic bores, industry and public water supply. As an aid to management of the complex system the Water Corporation and the Water and Rivers Commission (now DEWCP – Department of Environment, <b>Water</b> and <b>Catchment</b> <b>Protection)</b> commissioned CSIRO Land and Water to develop a computer model to calculate recharge to the coastal aquifers. This recharge model {{is known as the}} Vertical Flux Model (VFM) Manager and forms a new package for MODFLOW. Because {{of the size of the}} domain (over 6000 km 2) and computational constraints, we have divided the domain into a number of Representative Recharge Units (RRUs). The RRUs are determined by soil, climate, land-use and watertable depth. There are a large number of possible RRU combinations, but only a few hundred are actually extant at any one time. Recharge is calculated on a daily basis for each existing RRU and accumulated for each MODFLOW stress period. The daily recharge is calculated by a number of models depending on land use. For pine plantations, native bushland and pasture, recharge is calculated by a detailed 1 -dimensional biophysical model (WAVES). For urban areas, irrigated horticulture and watered parkland a simple model based on rainfall and potential evaporation is used. For each time step in the MODFLOW model a new watertable surface is determined. The depth to watertable is used by the VFM Manager to interpolate the recharge between the closest RRUs. Land use information, incorporating vegetation leaf area index (LAI), can be updated at each stress period if required. This enabled an investigation of the effects of natural events such as bushfires, and changes in land use on the distribution of recharge...|$|R

In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area in Sleman Regency.

40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} have assumed {{for years that}} the availability of free-standing water was a primary factor limiting the distribution, productivity, and recruitment of desert ungulates in the southwestern United States. As a result, wildlife management agencies and sportsman's organizations have invested significant time and resources in the construction and maintenance of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> for game species, including desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Recently the efficacy of these catchments has been questioned and their use has become controversial. Although <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> {{have been used as}} a wildlife management tool for decades, very few studies have experimentally examined the influence of these catchments on populations. The objective {{of this study was to}} experimentally examine the influence of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> on diet, movement, home range size, mortality, productivity, and recruitment of desert bighorn sheep.

40|$|Access to {{safe water}} is {{essential}} to maintain life. An understanding of all the potential contamination risks {{and an ability to}} manage those risks is imperative in the supply of water for human consumption. Having multiple scientifically validated barriers to contamination is the most widely accepted management technique for drinking <b>water</b> <b>protection.</b> <b>Catchment</b> management is a barrier that aims to control contamination at the source thereby reducing the reliance of removal of contamination by treatment. Buffer strips are one such measure. They are known to be effective at minimising waterway pollution by reducing the momentum and magnitude of surface and sub-surface runoff thereby aiding infiltration into the soil column and promoting entrapment of pollutants. This process has been well researched in terms of constituents such as sediments and nutrients. In a drinking <b>water</b> <b>catchment,</b> however, the ability of these buffer strips to trap or remove human infectious pathogens is of most interest as they are the greatest risk to consumers. The aim of this research is to determine a way of predicting the decrease in risk to public health due to the implementation of buffer strips in an agricultural catchment and to validate their effectiveness. A drinking <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> with an extensive amount of water quality data and an active catchment management program was chosen as the study catchment. Detailed statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes in water quality and to determine trends. Additionally the processes most affecting water quality were established. To enable prediction of any changes a model that specifically simulated pathogen fate and transport through a catchment was necessary. A simple lumped conceptual model, EG, was chosen. EG was not, however, specifically developed to determine the effectiveness of buffer strips and therefore modifications to the pathogen transport processes were required. Calibration, validation and uncertainty analyses were undertaken. This research shows {{that it is possible to}} quantify the benefits of buffer strip implementation to final drinking water quality. Validation of the barrier’s effectiveness will allow the comparison of investing in catchment management to treatment costs and an assessment of the risk reduction benefits of both...|$|R
