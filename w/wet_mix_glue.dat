Dry <b>mix</b> differ from <b>Wet</b> <b>mix</b> plants in that <b>Wet</b> <b>Mix</b> contain a central mixer whereas dry, which can offer a more consistent mixture in a shorter time (generally 5 minutes or less). Dry mix plants typically see more break strength standard deviation and variation from load to load because of inconsistencies in mix times, truck blade and drum conditions, traffic conditions, etc. With a Central Mix plant, all loads see the same mixing action and there is an initial quality control point when discharging from the central mixer. Certain plants combine both Dry and Wet characteristics for increased production or for seasonality. le A Mobile batch plant can be constructed on a large job site.|$|R

40|$|In this research, copper nanocomposites {{reinforced}} by graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were fabricated using a <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> method {{followed by a}} classical powder metallurgy route. In order {{to find the best}} dispersion technique, ball milling and <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> were chosen. Qualitative evaluation {{of the structure of the}} graphene after mixing indicated that the <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> is an appropriate technique to disperse the GNPs. Thereafter, the influence of graphene content on microstructure, density, hardness, elastic modulus, and thermal expansion coefficient of composites was investigated. It was shown that by increasing the graphene content the aggregation of graphene is more obvious and, thus, these agglomerates affect the final properties adversely. In comparison with the unreinforced Cu, Cu–GNP composites were lighter, and their hardness and Young’s modulus were higher as a consequence of graphene addition. According to the microstructural observation of pure copper and its composites after sintering, it was concluded that grain refinement is the main mechanism of strengthening in this research. Apart from the mechanical characteristics, the coefficient of thermal expansion of composites decreased remarkably and the combination of this feature with appropriate mechanical properties can make them a promising candidate for use in electronic packaging applications...|$|R

The feed industry standard is a %CV of less than 10 using a single source tracer such as salt, trace minerals or iron filings. The {{uniformity of}} mix can be affected by many factors including ingredient properties, equipment design, mix time, sampling method, sample preparation and overall precision of method. The objectives of this thesis were to verify the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method and {{to determine the effect}} of extended mixing time, salt particle size, sample preparation, <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time, spray condition, application time of the liquid addition, percent liquid addition and mixer type on the uniformity of mix. The first experiment evaluated the effect of water temperature, technician, extraction time, dissolution time on the chloride ion test by the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The salt concentration was significantly affected by water temperature and dissolution time. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the 60 ºC water temperature and the 30 s extraction time by stirring followed by immediately placing the strip into the solution after extraction should be used for the Quantab® chloride titrator method. The second experiment evaluated the effect of extended mix time, particle size of salt and sample preparation on the %CV. The extended mix time did not result in segregation (P > 0. 30). However, particle size of the salt and sample preparation significantly affected the uniformity of mix. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that the extended mix time of up to 60 minutes did not increase the %CV of the feed; the particle size of the salt used in the uniformity of mix test can significantly change the results of the test; and grinding the sample prior to analysis improved the precision of the Quantab® chloride titrator method when coarse salt is used in the manufacturing process. The third experiment evaluated the effect of <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time and the timing of the liquid addition using different spray conditions on the %CV. The <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time significantly changed the %CV of the mixture (P = 0. 0057). The use of a spray nozzle had no effect on the %CV of the feed mixture when a 1. 14 % of a 23 % saline solution was sprayed on to the feed (P = 0. 7435). The results of Experiment 3 indicated the <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time had a greater influence on the uniformity of mix than the type of nozzle used to apply the liquid; and the shorter liquid application time allowed more time for the mechanical shear of the ribbons and paddles to break up the agglomerated wet particles and distribute them throughout the feed mixture when the total time of the liquid addition plus <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time was fixed. The fourth experiment evaluated the effect of different percent liquid addition, application time and mixer type with different <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> times on the uniformity of mix. The %CV of feed mixed using a fixed <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> time setting did not change when the percent liquid addition was increased, while the %CV of the feed mixed using a fixed total liquid mix time setting increased when increasing the percent liquid addition. The %CV of feed mixed with a ribbon mixer did not change when the liquid application time was decreased while the %CV of the feed mixed with a paddle mixer increased when decreasing the liquid application time. Differences were observed in the %CV based on the parameters of liquid cycle time, mixer type and mixer size. The results of Experiment 4 indicated the liquid addition time and the percent of liquid addition affected the uniformity of mix. The uniformity of liquid application should be tested with the highest percent liquid addition. Furthermore, application and <b>wet</b> <b>mix</b> times should be determined for each mixer type and size to establish the optimal batch cycle...|$|R

The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological <b>glues.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of gamma-PGA or gelatin increased. The swelling ratio decreased and the denaturation temperature increased upon raising the EDC concentration, indicating a greater degree of crosslinking at higher EDC concentrations. The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> crosslinked with various concentrations of EDC (1. 7 - 2. 5 %) showed no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. In addition, no significant inflammatory response was observed in the rat subcutaneous implantation. The bioadhesives based on gelatin/gamma-PGA remained at the site for 7 days while the fibrin glue had almost completely degraded. By choosing the appropriate gelatin type and higher molecular weight gamma-PGA in the mixtures, the gelatin/gamma-PGA biological glues could serve as soft tissue adhesives.

The interfacial bonding evaluation shows a poor interfacial bonding between GNPs and Al, while the interfacial bonding between Cu and GNPs is strong enough to improve the properties of the Cu/GNPs nanocomposites.

However, the CO 2 capture capacities of natural CaO-based sorbents decrease sharply {{after only a}} few cycles. This paper presents a novel <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> combustion synthesis to improve the cyclic CO 2 capture performance of CaO-based sorbents. Results show that preparation conditions significantly affected the cyclic performance of the sorbents. The optimal molar ratios of calcium to magnesium and fuel to metal oxides were 2 and 0. 5, respectively, for the preparation process. The <b>wet</b> <b>mixing</b> combustion synthesis did not show the highest CO 2 capture capacity in comparison to the sol-gel combustion synthesis, however, the proposed method is still valid due to the low cost of the materials used. The sorbent prepared by the new method could achieve relatively stable cyclic CO 2 capture behavior, and showed a porous microstructure that can be maintained during cyclic reactions. The capture capacity of the sorbent obtained a 0. 4 g CO 2 /g sorbent after 50 cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
