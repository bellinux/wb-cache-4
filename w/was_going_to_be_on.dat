The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by Steve Gomer, marking Ruggiero's fifteenth writing credit, and Gomer's fourth and final directing credit for the series. The episode features a guest appearance by Patty Hearst, a wealthy heiress and famous kidnapping victim. Series creator Rob Thomas {{came up with the}} idea for Hearst's storyline in July 2006, stating, [...] "If we can get Patty Hearst to play a board of trustees member – what if she got kidnapped? That would be a pretty great story to tell. It's not an idea we've broken, but it's up on the wall as a possibility." [...] Hearst had recently appeared on single-episode parts on Boston Common and Son of the Beach. Due to a miscommunication between Thomas, Hearst, and her agent, Hearst was booked for Veronica Mars before she knew about the guest role, with Thomas telling TV Guide that she was playing a character that was similar to herself. Hearst described reacting to the casting news: [...] "I was on the computer one day and read that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Veronica Mars. Rob Thomas was giving an interview and happily saying, 'Oh yes, and we’re very excited.'

[...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time.
