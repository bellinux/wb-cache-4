50|$|The Yasuní Biosphere Reserve {{has more}} than 500 species of birds.Endangered birds include <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa).|$|E
50|$|Threatened birds {{found in}} the Serranía de las Quinchas include the <b>wattled</b> guan, blue-billed <b>curassow,</b> saffron-headed parrot, white-mantled barbet, {{beautiful}} woodpecker, Antioquia bristle-tyrant, grey-throated warbler, turquoise dacnis and sooty ant-tanager.

50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) is a {{threatened}} {{member of the}} family Cracidae, the curassows, guans, and chachalacas. It is found in remote rainforests in the western Amazon basin in South America. Males have black plumage, except for a white crissum (the area around the cloaca), with curly feathers on the head and red bill ornaments and wattles. Females and juveniles are similar but lack the bill ornamentation and have a reddish-buff crissum area. The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> is the most ancient lineage of the southern Crax curassows. In captivity, it sometimes hybridises with the blue-billed curassow.|$|E
5000|$|... 633 {{bird species}} have been reported.These include many aquatic species such as heron and egret (Egretta and Ardea genera), {{whistling}} duck (Dendrocygna species), ibis (Cercibis and Theristicus species) and roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja).Endangered birds include <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster).|$|E
50|$|According to {{cladistic}} {{analysis of}} multisequence mtDNA data, the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is the most}} ancient lineage of the southern Crax curassows. Its origins date back some 6-5.5 mya ago (Messinian, Late Miocene) when its ancestors became isolated in the western Amazon rainforest. Although a close relationship to the red-billed curassow (C. blumenbachii) has been proposed, the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{seems to be a}} quite basal lineage without particularly close relatives. The similarity with the red-billed curassow seems to be mostly {{due to the fact that}} these are the most ancient species of the southern lineage, retaining more plesiomorphies. Though externally still fairly alike, the two species have vastly different calls and probably evolved, at about the same time, at opposite ends of the original southern Crax curassow's range.|$|E
5000|$|... 624 {{species of}} birds have been reported.Endangered birds include <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster).There are 88 species of snakes and 30 species of lizards.Large {{reptiles}} include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus).Endangered amphibians include Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni).|$|E
50|$|More than 70 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} have been identified.Fish {{in the two}} lakes include abundant members of the genera Potamorhina, Psectrogaster and Curimata.Important bird species include the toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) and Klages's antwren (Myrmotherula klagesi), both in the extreme west of their ranges, and the little-known <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) of the várzea, which may be threatened with extinction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is roughly}} {{equivalent}} to a wild turkey in size and stays in dry areas of the Amazonian forest. It is classified as endangered, with a wild population of only an estimated 350 to 1,500 scattered in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. Their primary threat is hunting, with habitat loss also contributing. White Oak maintains a population of the birds.|$|E
50|$|About 542 {{species of}} birds have been recorded, of which 500 {{are found in the}} Amacayacu National Park.Birds endemic to the {{ecoregion}} or rarely found elsewhere in the Amazon region include ashy-tailed swift (Chaetura andrei), blue-tufted starthroat (Heliomaster furcifer), pavonine quetzal (Pharomachrus pavoninus), white-eared jacamar (Galbalcyrhynchus leucotis), ochre-striped antpitta (Grallaria dignissima), Salvin's curassow (Mitu salvini), and golden-winged tody-flycatcher (Poecilotriccus calopterus).Endangered birds include <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa).|$|E
5000|$|... 572 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} including migrant toucan (Ramphastos genus), Amazon parrot (Amazona genus), and macaw (Ara genus). Resident birds included tanagers (Tangara and Tachyphonus genera), woodcreepers (Xiphorhynchus genus), resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), 15 species of curassows (Crax, Nothocrax, Mitu and Pauxi genera), and tinamous (Crypturellus and Tinamus genera).Endangered birds include <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus).|$|E
50|$|The IUCN used to {{classify}} the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> as a Vulnerable species under criteria A2bcd+3bcd+4bcd; C2a(i). This means that its numbers have declined {{and continue to}} decline by about one-third every decade, mainly due to hunting, with habitat destruction as another major threat, and that most likely between 2,500 and 10,000 adults exist, {{but not more than}} 1,000 in any one subpopulation. In 2010, this classification was uplifted to Endangered.|$|E
5000|$|... 681 {{species of}} birds have been reported, {{including}} herons and egrets (Egretta and Ardea genera), whistling ducks (Dendrocygninae family), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca), ibis (Theristicus genus), and the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Endemic birds include ash-throated crake (Mustelirallus albicollis), plain-breasted ground dove (Columbina minuta), red-shouldered macaw (Diopsittaca nobilis), green-rumped parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), scaled ground cuckoo (Neomorphus squamiger), and stygian owl (Asio stygius).Endangered birds include sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa), varzea piculet (Picumnus varzeae), green-thighed parrot (P'ionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is rarely}} {{found in the}} wild anymore, due to {{unsustainable}} hunting and habitat destruction. While its status has rarely been well studied, the number of old and modern records strongly indicates that it is much rarer nowadays {{than it was in}} the late 19th century. The species seems to have disappeared from Ecuador in the 1980s, while populations persist in remote areas of the other countries from which it is known. It is nowhere numerous, and the only known region where it can be encountered reasonably often might be along the Juruá River in Brazil, in particular in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve; it is also present in some numbers near San Marcos in Beni Department, Bolivia. It might occur in unexplored locations; its presence in Colombia for example was only proven around 1950 when a bird was shot in Caquetá Department, at Tres Troncos on the Caquetá River (from where the species has since disappeared). But any undiscovered populations are unlikely to be large - and even though they might remain unknown to science as soon as hunting with firearms starts in a region the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> is liable to get shot more often than it reproduces.|$|E
50|$|To {{the eastern}} limit of its range, the Madeira River, {{upstream}} in Bolivia, the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> occurs patchily across most of northern Bolivia in a 700 km region surrounding the confluences to the Madeira's tributaries, four major rivers of northern Bolivia. In Brazil, {{the bird is}} only found in the wild in Amazonas state (it used to occur in Rondônia also), namely near the Juruá, the Javary, the Japurá, and at its northeasternmost limit around the confluence regions along the Solimões, Madeira, Rio Negro, and the Purus Rivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-billed curassow}} {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} a length of 82 to 92 cm. The male has pure black upper parts with a large black crest, and white underparts. There are bright red wattles and knobs {{at the base of}} the bill. The male can be distinguished from the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) by being less bluish-black and from the black curassow (Crax alector) by being less purplish-black. The female lacks the wattles and has black upper parts, a black and white barred crest, reddish-brown wings barred and mottled with black, and reddish-brown or ochre underparts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is about}} 82 - 89 cm long, and weighs around 2,500 g. It {{is a large}} curassow lacking the white tail-tips found {{in many of these}} birds; the {{feathers}} along the crest of its head are curled forwards. Males have black plumage all over except for the white crissum. The irides are dark brown; legs, feet and bill are blackish. It has conspicuous crimson bill ornaments - a round red knob with bony core adorns the maxilla base, while the cere extends apically at least halfway under this knob and below the mandible base forms a small fleshy wattle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> is gallery forests and seasonally-flooded forests where it feeds {{in small groups}} on the ground. The diet is largely fruit, but {{invertebrates}} and some small vertebrates are opportunistically taken. Little is known of its breeding habits bur the nest is built of sticks and leaves and two eggs are usually laid. The population of this species is declining. It is threatened by loss of habitat, as the rainforest is progressively cleared, and by hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{wildlife}} that inhabits the ACRCTT area are monkeys the huapo Colorado or bald uakari (Cacajao calvus ucayalii), the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus); the pink dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), the grey dolphin (Sotalia fluviatilis), the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), the black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), the giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), jaguar (Panthera onca), the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax globulosa), the hoazin (Opisthocomus hoazin), the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), among others.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{look very}} much {{like those of the}} red-billed curassow (C. blumenbachii), whose males have only an indistinct maxilla knob. Its females have a blackish cere, rather pale legs and feet, and their wings - {{particularly}} the remiges - usually have distinct chestnut brown marbling. The black curassow subspecies C. alector erythrognatha, found north of the Solimões, has a cere like the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> female, but its bill is lighter and the crissum is white in both sexes. Young C. globulosa males are easily confused with those of the yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni), but the latter has a white tail-margin and yellow (not orange) bill wattle. All these similar species are allopatric however, with only C. a. erythrognatha occurring adjacent to the range of C. globulosa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6-5.5 mya, the ancestors of the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed curassow found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and black curassow lineages apparently took place around the Uquian - Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is one of}} the Crax species {{described}} in 1825 by Johann Baptist von Spix; the type locality is the Solimões (middle Amazon River) region. Its scientific name Crax globulosa can be translated as [...] "knobbed curassow". Crax is a term for curassows introduced by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his 1760s Ornithologia and adopted by Linnaeus as a genus name in the Systema naturae. globulosa indicates the possession of one or more prominent round surface features (from Latin globus [...] "a globe"); it the present case it obviously refers to the adult male's prominent bill knob. This bird, with its remarkable features, was subsequently described as new by several scientists who were unawares of von Spix' description. It has no recognized subspecies.|$|E
50|$|From captivity, hybrids {{with the}} blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti) are known. That species {{is one of}} the {{northern}} group of Crax. The yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni) is probably closest to it, but regardless, they are quite distinct from the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow.</b> But viable (though not dependably fertile) hybrids are suspected to be possible between any two species of Cracidae. The color and shape of the bill ornaments of male Crax hybrids are not easily predicted, but character displacement would demand the eastern (if any) subspecies of the black curassow (C. a. alector) to have a red ornamentation, as no red-ornamented congeners occur in or near its range. The red cere of the western black curassow may well be due to occasional hybrid introgression of C. globulosa alleles, as {{it is unlikely that the}} Solimões is entirely impassable to these birds.|$|E
50|$|The habitat {{preference}} of the <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is not well}} studied either. Some have found it in terra firme rainforest on higher ground, but it probably occurs there in any numbers only in the wet season when the lowlands are flooded. Most sightings were in gallery forest along rivers and streams (particularly blackwater), seasonally flooded várzea forest, around lakes, and on river islands. Várzea seems to be key habitat for this species, at least seasonally. Mated pairs probably defend a territory as other curassows do, and many seem to be entirely sedentary for their whole life. Young birds would thus have to disperse a bit after growing up, if their parents are still alive. But even then they probably stay in the same general area, moving perhaps a few km/miles from their place of birth at most.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow</b> (Crax globulosa) is a {{globally}} {{threatened species}} restricted to humid varzea forest (seasonally flooded forest along white-water rivers) in low-lying regions of Amazonia. The <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow</b> {{were thought to}} have been extirpated from the Beni area of Bolivia, but were rediscovered near the Rio Negro River in 2001. Our objectives were to determine the size of this population, examine habitat use, and based on our results, assess the conservation status of the <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow.</b> During July and August 2006, we used distance sampling to estimate the population density in our study area. We estimated the density of Wattled Curassows at 3. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 4 - 8. 1) individuals/km(2) and all were observed within 300 m of the river. Based on the availability of suitable habitat (18 km(2) of riparian varzea habitat within 300 m of the river), we estimated that the breeding population of Wattled Curassows in our study area consisted of 61 individuals. The specialized habitat requirements of the <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow</b> has important conservation implications because previous population estimates were based on the availability of varzea forest rather than the availability of water edge habitat within varzea forest. As a result, the current global population estimate (2500 - 9999) is higher than our estimate (500 - 2500) that takes the specialized habitat requirements of the <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow</b> into account. Given this low estimated population, along with the severely fragmented state of the few remaining populations and their dependence on a specialized and vulnerable habitat, we recommend that the status of the <b>Wattled</b> <b>Curassow</b> be upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered...|$|E
40|$|Amazon {{population}} genetics: {{the evolutionary}} {{history of the}} jaguar, ocelot, pink river dolphin, woolly monkey and <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> reconstructed through their genes The Amazon has more than the half of the world’s biodiversity. Nevertheless, the major fraction of the Amazon species has unknown evolutionary histories. This is also certain for mammals and birds. Population genetics, employing molecular markers and theoretical mathematics models, can reconstruct these evolutionary histories and offer very powerful tools {{for the application of}} correct conservation politics. Herein, we show a comparative view of population genetics results obtained for Amazon populations of jaguar, ocelot, pink river dolphin, woolly monkey and <b>wattled</b> <b>curassow</b> and provide recommendation for their biological conservation. Each species showed its own specific evolutionary particularities, characteristics that were not shared by the other species. This finding should be taken into consideration for any effective biological conservation program...|$|E
