40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors propose a new {{approach}} to the study of <b>weight</b> <b>systems.</b> Instead of considering graphs whose vertices correspond to the generators of a Lie algebra (as for Cartan subalgebras in the semisimple case), the authors consider the whole <b>weight</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose is to extract information about the <b>weight</b> <b>system</b> from the geometry of the weights. The considerations are restricted to the case where a torus of derivations induces a decomposition of a nilpotent Lie algebra g into one-dimensional weight spaces, none of which is associated with the zero weight. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 the most important facts of <b>weight</b> <b>systems</b> of nilpotent Lie algebras and the root system associated to solvable Lie algebras are recalled. In Section 3 the authors formulate their conditions on the <b>weight</b> <b>systems</b> and analyze the consequences of these conditions on the structure of the <b>weight</b> <b>system.</b> They also define associated weight graphs and deduce their elementary geometrical properties. This provides a characterization of the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra in terms of trees. Section 4 is devoted to the study of certain subgraphs of a weight graph which can be used to reconstruct the <b>weight</b> <b>system</b> from the <b>weight</b> graph. If r is a semidirect product of g and a torus T these subgraphs determine bounds for the solvability class of r. In Section 5 these results are applied to obtain a geometrical proof of the nonexistence of two-step solvable rigid Lie algebras. ...|$|R
