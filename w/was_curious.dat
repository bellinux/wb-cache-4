5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, {{made it impossible for}} them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> {{about the}} price of {{potatoes}} and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> and interested in learning.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{historical}} treatise Shi Yi Ji {{mentioned that}} Lady Pan {{was known as}} the fairest lady in Jiangdong, who also could predict the future. Therefore people in the textile factory alienated and called her Shen Nü (神女), which means goddess. Although she looked glum, Sun Quan was still shocked by her beauty and <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> about the way she smiles. Lady Pan was later brought into the palace and loved by Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> that an {{organization}} like the IWW with its revolutionary philosophy and its reputation for violence conducted a major strike {{with so little}} violence.

25|$|In addition, {{possibly}} {{two different}} animals were seen off Bonin Islands on 12th and 25th March 2014. Later one was larger, and <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> towards whale-watching vessels. The whale was observed interacting with a Humpback whale. Izu and Bonin Islands are regions with highest confirmed sightings and strandings rates among tropical {{regions in the}} past century. In 1993, Yasuhiro Morita of Ogasawara Diving Center succeeded in encountering right whales on four different occasions near the Bonin Islands.|$|E
25|$|Experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) {{concluded}} {{that one of}} the nineteen 9/11 hijackers, Ahmed al-Haznawi, had likely been exposed to anthrax. al-Haznawi and another man arrived in the emergency room of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hospital presenting an ugly, dark lesion on his leg that he said he developed after bumping into a suitcase two months earlier. Christos Tsonas thought the injury <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> cleaned it and prescribed an antibiotic. After September 11, federal investigators found the medicine prescribed by Tsonas among the possessions of al-Haznawi.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Xiapi in late 198, {{when the}} allied forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei fought against Lü Bu, Guan Yu made a request to Cao Cao, asking to marry Qin Yilu's wife Lady Du (杜氏) after they had {{achieved}} victory. Cao Cao agreed, and Guan Yu repeatedly reminded Cao Cao about his promise before the battle was won. After Lü Bu's defeat and death, Cao Cao <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> about why Guan Yu wanted Lady Du so badly and he guessed that she must be very beautiful, so he had her brought to him. Cao Cao broke his promise to Guan Yu, as he took Lady Du as his concubine and adopted her son Qin Lang (whom she had with Qin Yilu).|$|E

25|$|Odysseus <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> as to {{what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E
25|$|When Lü Bu was {{besieged by}} {{the allied forces}} of Cao Cao and Liu Bei at the Battle of Xiapi in 198, Lü Bu sent Qin Yilu to seek {{reinforcements}} from the warlords Zhang Yang and Yuan Shu. Qin Yilu's wife, Lady Du (杜氏) and their son Qin Lang remained behind in Xiapi and stayed there as the city fell to Cao Cao's forces. Liu Bei's general Guan Yu repeatedly asked Cao Cao to let him marry Lady Du after their victory over Lü Bu. Cao Cao <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> about why Guan Yu wanted Lady Du so badly, and he guessed that she must be very beautiful, so he ordered his men to bring her to meet him. As a result, despite Guan Yu's pleas, Lady Du became Cao Cao's concubine and Qin Lang became Cao Cao's adopted son.|$|E
25|$|Pholus <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> why {{the arrows}} caused so much death, and picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his foot, {{poisoning}} him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well, but Chiron was immortal, although he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great, he volunteered {{to give up}} his immortality, and take the place of Prometheus, who had been chained in {{to the top of a}} mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an eagle, although he was an immortal Titan. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught Achilles. The tale of the Centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.|$|E

500|$|The whitetip reef shark {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell as Carcharias obesus, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meere (Fishes of the Red Sea). His choice of the specific epithet obesus <b>was</b> <b>curious,</b> given that this shark is actually quite slender. Later in 1837, Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle moved this species into its own genus Triaenodon, from the Greek triaena meaning [...] "trident", and odon meaning [...] "tooth". As Rüppell did not originally designate a holotype, in 1960 a 31-cm-long specimen caught off Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was made the species lectotype. Other common names for this shark include blunthead shark, light-tip shark, reef whitetip shark, and whitetip shark.|$|E
500|$|After the battle, Xerxes <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> as to {{what the}} Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were {{participating}} in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: [...] "an olive-wreath". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: [...] "Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor!" [...] (Godley translation) or otherwise, [...] "Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Dinklage {{chose this}} episode as his {{submission}} named in his candidacy for the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Spenser Davis, writing for entertainment industry awards website GoldDerby, {{noted that the}} choice <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> because while the episode itself {{was nominated for a}} Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (which it lost to Friday Night Lights [...] "Always"), Dinklage's screen time in the episode was rather limited. Davis noted that Dinklage's nomination was the only acting Emmy nomination among the 13 received by the show, and opined that [...] "A Golden Crown" [...] better showcased Dinklage's contributions to the series. Dinklage's win was the only major award received by the series and the first Emmy of his career.|$|E

Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she actually said was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he <b>was</b> <b>curious.</b> She said, [...] "he was {{like a little kid}} who talked about the bases – what first base was, what second base was" [...] – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life.|$|E
