5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet,</b> they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

This growth has brought to light one of <b>the</b> <b>Internet’s</b> shortcomings: lack of support for efficient control and management of traffic, particularly between domains. This paper presents an extension to BGP, the inter-domain routeing protocol, that enables congestion to drive route selection and thus allows economic incentives to play their part in traffic distribution. Implementation in a deployed BGP stack is discussed and a simple simulation presented, showing better traffic distribution. ...|$|R
