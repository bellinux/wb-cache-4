However, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to officially withdraw from the election, and Chai received 5 percent of the votes.|$|E
5|$|St. Leger's {{failure to}} advance on Albany contributed to Burgoyne's {{surrender}} following the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777. Although St. Leger reached Fort Ticonderoga in late September, he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to aid Burgoyne.|$|E

5|$|Arrow Books also {{released}} a novelisation of the 1979 Quatermass serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail {{not included in}} the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for them to be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early sixties developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a monorail linking a series of individual townships to a major town centre. The county council published the proposals in 1966, but it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to influence the government.|$|E
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because {{he thought he would}} have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E

5|$|The episode closes {{with music}} from The Avengers. After the music had been recorded, Scully {{felt that it}} did not suit the ending and so wished to change it to {{something}} else. However, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> in production to get the full orchestra back to do a recording, and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> in the day to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} {{involved in}} politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became {{the leader of the}} Dixiecrat movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond at his home when he visited the state, but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign. By the time he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.|$|E
5|$|For their part, the Sassanids {{struggled}} {{to establish a}} stable government. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius' ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrow's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrow II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability, but by then it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to rescue the Sassanid kingdom.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, the blame for the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals {{intercepted by}} GC showed that even four {{hours after the}} {{invasion}} of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that {{an attack on the}} Balkans was imminent, and in late July he sent General Erwin Rommel to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to make a difference.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E

5|$|Outwardly at least, by 743 the Umayyad {{position}} in Khurasan appeared stronger than ever. The reality beneath the splendid façade however was different. Tension and mutual mistrust {{existed between the}} Khurasani Arab levies (muqatila) and the 20,000 Syrian troops introduced into the province as a security measure after the disastrous Battle of the Defile in 731, while tribal antagonism continued to create trouble: apart from continued Yemeni resentment at Nasr, there was strong dislike of the Umayyads' Syrian regime, fanned by their unjust tax policies. Although Nasr tried to remedy the situation, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight of the ships, and by then it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E

Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.|$|E
