25|$|When DreamWorks {{closed in}} 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009. He has {{released}} ten studio albums through Show Dog/Show Dog-Universal: 2006's <b>White</b> <b>Trash</b> with Money, 2007's Big Dog Daddy, 2008's That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy, 2009's American Ride, 2010's Bullets in the Gun, 2011's Clancy's Tavern, 2012's Hope on the Rocks, and 2013's Drinks After Work, 2015's 35 MPH Town, 2017's The Bus Songs, {{as well as}} the compilation 35 Biggest Hits in 2008. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film Broken Bridges, and co-starred with comedian Rodney Carrington in the 2008 film Beer for My Horses, inspired by his song of the same name.|$|E

25|$|The first Game Theory {{album was}} the Blaze of Glory LP, {{released}} on Rational Records in 1982. Due {{to a lack}} of funds to both press the album and print a jacket, a thousand copies of the LP were packaged in <b>white</b> plastic <b>trash</b> bags with Xeroxed cover art glued to each bag.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic's Stewart Mason {{wrote that}} Blaze of Glory was [...] "about as D.I.Y. as it gets.... {{recorded}} in leader Scott Miller's old bedroom at his parents' house in Sacramento, CA, {{and you can}} just barely hear his mom running the vacuum cleaner downstairs at one point." [...] Due to a lack of funds to both press the album and print a jacket, a thousand copies of the LP were packaged in <b>white</b> plastic <b>trash</b> bags with Xeroxed cover art glued to each bag.|$|R
50|$|Neveah, {{dressed in}} red sweat pants, a red {{shirt with a}} cartoon {{character}} on it and pink tennis shoes, was found on September 24, 2007, three days after being reported missing, in a <b>white</b> plastic <b>trash</b> bag under a tree stump in a ravine. She was found about 2 miles from the couple's apartment. At the time {{cause of death was}} undetermined, though it was later determined to be asphyxiation. On September 25, 2007, a candlelight vigil was held for her, with dozens of people placing flowers and stuffed toys at the ravine where Neveah was found. A permanent memorial was dedicated to Neveah on November 2, 2007.|$|R
500|$|After Till went missing, a three-paragraph {{story was}} {{printed in the}} Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They {{reported}} on his death when the body was found. The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> brings us to destruction." [...] The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the record's release, several {{critics and}} {{retailers}} openly {{questioned whether the}} band still had significant commercial appeal with mainstream consumers, with rap rock emerging as the predominant rock genre of the early 2000s. Furthermore, according to Metal Hammer, [...] "By {{the turn of the}} century, Manson was no longer America's demon dog. <b>White</b> <b>trash</b> superstar Eminem had clocked his position and supplanted him." [...] A clean version of the album was never manufactured. This resulted in Holy Wood being banned from sale at major retailers such as Walmart and Kmart, who enforce a strict policy on not stocking albums labeled with a Parental Advisory sticker. Best Buy's sales projections estimated its first-week sales at about 150,000 units nationally, significantly less than the 223,000 copies sold by Mechanical Animals during its first week.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Beckinsale {{appeared}} in Winged Creatures, {{a film about}} how six different witnesses cope with {{the aftermath of a}} shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. [...] "It was a really, really nice experience but it was quick," [...] said Beckinsale of the filming process. [...] "I just felt a bit like I was shot through a cannon." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role [...] "with a <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> verve" [...] and found her character's [...] "raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable." [...] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a [...] "tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés." [...] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.|$|E

My analysis builds and expands on recognised correspondences between the monstrous, the liminal and the carnival. I show how liminal aspects (both monstrous and carnivalesque) are cleverly co-opted by Die Antwoord into a monstrous carnivalesque extravaganza, whereby the liminal is converted into a suspended moment of consumption. The extent to which liminality is suspended and advanced as a consumable entity by Die Antwoord forms the primary focus of this investigation, after which the possibility of understanding the liminal in terms of affects is briefly explored. I argue that even that which is supposedly outside consumerist instrumentality, namely the limen, with its life-altering and transformative possibilities, can, to some degree, be aligned and made subservient to consumerist ideals. gv 201...|$|R
500|$|The {{accuracy}} of Boys Don't Cry was disputed by real-life {{people involved in}} the murder. The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered the truth about Brandon's sex, she ended the relationship and left him. Tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film, and called the film the [...] "second murder of Brandon Teena". Before the film's theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film's producers, claiming that the film depicted her as [...] "lazy, <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> and a skanky snake" [...] and that her family and friends had come to see her as [...] "a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder". [...] Tisdel said the film falsely portrayed her continuing her relationship with Teena after she discovered he was transgender. Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, [...] "There's none of it that's right. It was just weird." [...] Leslie Tisdel, Lana's sister, called the film [...] "a lie of a movie". Leslie {{was not included in the}} film, and her ties with the third victim, Phillip DeVine, were omitted due to storyline constraints.|$|E

2500|$|Winter's music {{encompasses}} {{many different}} genres, including rock, jazz, blues, and pop. From his critically acclaimed 1970 debut release, Entrance, he has demonstrated his unique style {{and ability to}} cross the genre lines and do the unexpected. His early recording of [...] "Tobacco Road" [...] propelled him into the national spotlight. Edgar followed Entrance with two hit albums backed by his group <b>White</b> <b>Trash,</b> a group originally composed of musicians from Texas and Louisiana. <b>White</b> <b>Trash,</b> with Winter and Jerry Lacroix both on lead vocals and sax, [...] enjoyed huge success, with the 1971 release of the studio album Edgar Winter's <b>White</b> <b>Trash,</b> and with 1972's follow-up live gold album (partially recorded at New York's famed Apollo Theater) Roadwork.|$|E

2500|$|The term redneck is a {{derogatory}} term chiefly {{used for}} a rural poor white person of the Southern United States.

2500|$|After They Only Come Out at Night, Winter {{released}} Shock Treatment, featuring guitarist Rick Derringer {{in place}} of Ronnie Montrose.

Regarding his ancestry, Myers wrote: [...] "I'm only half Scandinavian. The blood has been thinned with that of those domesticated English and Irish and Scots." [...] He was named [...] "Paul Zachary", after his grandfather, but preferred the initials PZ to being called [...] "Little Paul". He has described his family as [...] "probably what would be called the working poor nowadays", and noted that [...] "when I was growing up I was called <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> {{more than a few}} times".|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, NOFX {{released}} its third studio album, Ribbed. Shortly after {{the album was}} released, Steve Kidwiller left the band, and Aaron Abeyta (a.k.a. [...] "El Hefe") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play The Longest Line, followed by the studio album <b>White</b> <b>Trash,</b> Two Heebs and a Bean, released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label Mystic Records released Maximum Rocknroll, which compiles early singles and demo songs and is actually a reissue of their 1989 long-out of print compilation tape E Is for Everything. Although the band claims that Maximum Rocknroll was not released with their consent, it is listed on the discography of their website.|$|E
2500|$|A {{photograph}} of Smith {{was used by}} New York magazine {{on the cover of}} its August 22, 1994, issue titled <b>White</b> <b>Trash</b> Nation. In the photo, she appears squatting in a short skirt with cowboy boots as she eats chips. In October 1994, her lawyer T. Patrick Freydl initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the magazine, claiming that Smith did not authorize the use of her photo; the suit also alleged that the article damaged her reputation. Her lawyer stated Smith {{was under the impression that}} she was being photographed to embody the [...] "all-American look." [...] Editor Kurt Anderson said that the photo was one of dozens taken for the cover, further stating [...] "I guess they just found the picture we chose unflattering." [...] The lawsuit was reported to be settled.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2005, Keith {{founded a}} new label, Show Dog Nashville. Its first release was his 2006 album <b>White</b> <b>Trash</b> with Money, {{followed}} by the soundtrack to Broken Bridges. He also abandoned Stroud as co-producer in favor of Cannon's wife, Lari White.

2500|$|Unlike other bands {{associated}} with the 1990s alternative music movement, Primus emerged from a mostly heavy metal background, with Claypool and LaLonde previously {{a part of the}} 1980s Californian thrash metal underground. Kirk Hammett, guitarist of Bay Area thrash metal band Metallica, stated in an 1991 interview that Primus are [...] "unique, they're a square peg in a round hole". The music of Primus has been described as [...] "thrash-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr." [...] and [...] "the Freak Brothers set to music". Also, Primus has been categorized as alternative rock, alternative metal, experimental rock, funk rock, funk metal, progressive rock, and [...] "thrash-funk". Regarding the band's genre, Claypool has stated [...] "We've been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorise you". MTV suggests that Primus is [...] "a post-punk Rush spiked with the sensibility and humor of Frank Zappa". Les Claypool himself once described their music as [...] "psychedelic polka." [...] Spin have labelled Primus as [...] "pranksters" [...] and an [...] "unlikely gold-selling <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> purveyor of hard-ass pinballing funk metal".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Burleson, Clarkson {{was encouraged by}} her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series [...] in May 2002. Despite receiving a [...] "golden ticket," [...] a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode. In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred the inaugural season as [...] "ghetto", explaining: [...] "On our season we were like kids in camp. Nobody knew what to do. The show was ever-changing every day. They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK but America {{is a very different}} market. They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television'. I am maybe the closest to <b>white</b> <b>trash</b> you can get. What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress." [...] Clarkson {{went on to win the}} competition on September 4, 2002 at the then Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini and without being sent into the bottom three throughout the season.|$|E
