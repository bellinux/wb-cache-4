40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} four different absorber designs {{in this type of}} system: cross-current and counter-current packed-bed absorbers, the spray absorber and fluid-bed absorber. In a laboratory pilot, plant, <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> for the absorbers were determined under adiabatic conditions. The influences of internal solution flow, gas flow, pressure drop and dissipation are discussed. The <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> represent the efficiency for each absorber. The highest performance occurs with the packed-bed absorbers, followed by the fluid-bed absorber and finally the spray absorber. For open absorption systems in air-conditioning applications (small scale), the cross-current absorber is preferable, and for industrial utilization (large scale) the fluid-bed absorber should be chosen. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} fit a variable pitch fan. Scheduling the pitch of the fan blades has no impact upon {{the position of the}} fan <b>working</b> <b>lines,</b> but can be used to move the surge line upwards, to improve fan surge margin.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} {{is to have a}} variable area cold (or mixed) nozzle. Increasing the nozzle area at low flight speeds brings the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> away from surge.|$|E
50|$|As {{the second}} {{illustration}} shows, a low pressure ratio fan (such as that {{used on a}} high bypass ratio turbofan) has a range of working lines. At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke. Above the choking condition, the working lines tend to coalesce into a unique steep straight line. When the nozzle unchokes, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> starts to become more curved, reflecting the curvature of the nozzle characteristic. With falling flight Mach number, the cold nozzle pressure ratio decreases. Initially this has no effect upon {{the position of the}} <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> apart from the curved (unchoked) tail, which becomes longer. Eventually, the cold nozzle will become unchoked at lower flight Mach numbers, even at full throttle. The working lines will now become curved, gradually migrating towards surge as flight Mach number decreases. The lowest surge margin <b>working</b> <b>line</b> occurs at static conditions.|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the eleven current <b>working</b> <b>lines,</b> the network is currently being expanded {{with the introduction of}} a double metro line which will be the longest in continental Europe: L9/L10. Nearly all existing lines are also growing, some extensively like L2, and as of 2014 they are undergoing reforms.|$|R
50|$|Working {{lines are}} {{difficult}} to see on a conventional turbine map because the speed lines bunch up. One trick is to replot the map, with the y-axis being the multiple of flow and corrected speed. This separates the speed <b>lines,</b> enabling <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> (and efficiency contours) to be cross-plotted and clearly seen.|$|R

5000|$|Some high-bypass-ratio civil turbofans use an {{extremely}} low area ratio (less than 1.01), convergent-divergent, nozzle on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream, {{to control the}} fan <b>working</b> <b>line.</b> The nozzle acts {{as if it has}} variable geometry. At low flight speeds the nozzle is unchoked (less than a Mach number of unity), so the exhaust gas speeds up as it approaches the throat and then slows down slightly as it reaches the divergent section. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match and, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake increases nozzle pressure ratio {{to the point where the}} throat becomes choked (M=1.0). Under these circumstances, the throat area dictates the fan match and, being smaller than the exit, pushes the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly towards surge. This is not a problem, since fan surge margin is much better at high flight speeds.|$|E
5000|$|The IP {{compressor}} outlet corrected flow must match the entry corrected {{flow of the}} HP compressor, which is decreasing as the engine is throttled back. At a certain IP compressor <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slope, the IP {{compressor outlet}} corrected flow remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> the extra IP compressor pressure ratio at a given IP compressor entry corrected flow enables the IP compressor outlet corrected flow to decrease and match up with the falling HP compressor entry corrected flow. Unfortunately {{this can lead to}} a poor IP compressor surge margin at part flow.|$|E
50|$|Surge margin can be {{improved}} by adding variable stators to the IP compressor and/or adding a blow-off valve between the IP and HP compressors. The former makes the IP compressor surge line shallower, swinging {{it away from the}} shallow <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> thus improving IP compressor surge margin.|$|E
