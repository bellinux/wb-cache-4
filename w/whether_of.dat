5|$|Johnson's first fight {{probably}} {{took place}} in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter. Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him {{as a matter of}} honour, and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match. Johnson's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> England or the world is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E

After giving an analysis of ‘won’t’ claims (i. e., claims that an agent won’t Φ), the question is separated into two different issues: firstly, <b>whether</b> predictions <b>of</b> wrongdoing affect our objective moral obligations, and secondly, <b>whether</b> self-prediction <b>of</b> wrongdoing can be legitimately used in moral deliberation. I argue for an affirmative answer to both questions, although there are conditions that must be met for self-prediction to be appropriate in deliberation. The discussion illuminates an interesting and significant tension between agency and prediction. Jennie Louis...|$|R

25|$|Early timber-framed covered bridges {{consisted}} of horizontal beams laid {{on top of}} piles driven into the riverbed below. However, this construction method meant that the length between bridge spans was limited by the maximum length of each beam. The development of the timber truss circumvented that limitation and allowed bridges to span greater distances than those with beam-only structures or arch structures, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> stone, masonry, or timber.|$|E
25|$|The Karma {{theory of}} Buddhism is {{integrated}} into its Twelve Nidanas doctrine, {{and has been}} extensively commented on by ancient Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna. Karma consists of any intentional action, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> body or speech or in mind, which can be either advantageous (merit) or disadvantageous (demerit). Both good and bad karma sustain the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and associated dukkha, and both prevent the attainment of nirvana.|$|E
25|$|We treat R1 as an {{inference}} rule, {{even though}} it is like an axiom in having no premises, because it is a domain-independent rule along with R2 and R3 common to all equational axiomatizations, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> groups, rings, or any other variety. The only entity specific to Boolean algebras is axiom schema A1. In this way when talking about different equational theories we can push the rules to one side as being independent of the particular theories, and confine attention to the axioms as {{the only part of the}} axiom system characterizing the particular equational theory at hand.|$|E

25|$|Larvophile mouthbrooders {{lay eggs}} in the open or in a cave and take the hatched larvae into the mouth. Examples include some {{variants}} of Geophagus altifrons, and some Aequidens, Gymnogeophagus, and Satanoperca, as well as Oreochromis mossambicus and Oreochromis niloticus. Mouthbrooders, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> eggs or larvae, are predominantly females. Exceptions that also involve the males include eretmodine cichlids (genera Spathodus, Eretmodus, and Tanganicodus), some Sarotherodon species, Chromidotilapia guentheri, and some Aequidens species. Rare paternal mouthbrooding occurs, for example, in Sarotherodon melanotheron. This method appears to have evolved independently in several groups of African cichlids.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{technological}} inventions of the period– <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations– were to {{have great}} influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the cross-staff, the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had a greater impact on everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} employed human physiological specimen for detecting AAS usage is urine, although both blood and hair {{have been investigated}} for this purpose. The AAS, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation {{by a variety of}} enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites may be detectable for up to 30 days after the last use, depending on the specific agent, dose and route of administration. A number of the drugs have common metabolic pathways, and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the endogenous steroids, making interpretation of testing results a very significant challenge to the analytical chemist. Methods for detection of the substances or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel {{is as much about}} the nature of kingship as it is about the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having a very clear love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E

25|$|Among general {{reasons for}} {{harmful effects of}} dietary {{supplements}} are: a) absorption in a short time; b) quality and contamination; and c) enhancing {{both positive and negative}} effects at the same time. The number of incidents of liver damage from dietary supplements has tripled in a decade. Most of the products causing that effect were bodybuilding supplements. Some of the victims required liver transplants and some died. A third of the supplements involved contained unlisted steroids. Mild to severe toxicity has occurred on many occasions due to dietary supplements, even when the active ingredients were essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals or amino acids. This has been a result of adulteration of the product, excessive usage {{on the part of the}} consumer, or use by persons at risk for the development of adverse effects. In addition, a number of supplements contain psychoactive drugs, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> natural or synthetic origin.|$|E
25|$|In every discourse, <b>whether</b> <b>of</b> {{the mind}} conversing {{with its own}} thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E
