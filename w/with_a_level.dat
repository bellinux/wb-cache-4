5|$|In testing {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic gelatin covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Level</b> II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic gelatin, in tests {{conducted by}} Houston Police Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

This study {{examines}} the individual differences influencing the patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in the perception of emotional words. This study explores how individuals’ level of depression and anxiety affects how they perceive emotional words varying in valence and arousal. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> of depression demonstrated more hemispheric asymmetry <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bias toward words presented to the left hemisphere, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> of depression had no hemispheric differences. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> of depression demonstrated a bias toward positive words, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> of depression had no difference in valence. Similarly, participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> of anxiety had a positivity bias, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> of anxiety had no difference in valence. These findings indicate similarities and differences in emotional perception in depression and anxiety and may represent some of the neurological underpinnings of these disorders.

5|$|In the 1970s the {{downtown}} area experienced a resurgence, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By {{the end of the}} decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona) and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
