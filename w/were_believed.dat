50|$|Bioinformatic {{analysis}} identified four methyltransferases {{within the}} cluster. Bioinformatics suggest that btmB, is an O-methyltransferase, {{while the other}} three, btmC, G and K, are radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methyltransferases. The radical SAM methyltransferases <b>are</b> <b>believed</b> to β-methylate amino acid residues within the precursor peptide. btmC <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to methylate phenylalanine, btmG <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to methylate both valines, and btmK <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to methylate proline based on gene deletion studies.|$|R

Once the drugs arrive in their destination in the United States, it <b>is</b> then <b>believed</b> they <b>are</b> transported to New York City, where distribution cells controlled by Abadia then sell the product. During the mid-1990s Abadia <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> to <b>be</b> the youngest leader of the Cali cartel.|$|R
5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> to be shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E
5|$|Ale <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> {{to be able}} to make men insane; {{in eastern}} Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people {{encountered}} an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{peoples in}} the region <b>are</b> <b>believed</b> to have <b>been</b> nomadic hunters in search of big game roaming throughout the Four Corners region.

5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|Bentworth was {{the largest}} parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham itself.

The former comprised Lasham and Shalden and half a hide which had been taken from the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries in the Survey, but they <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> to have been included in the large manor of Odiham.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> to be carnivores. This erroneous conception {{was based}} on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
