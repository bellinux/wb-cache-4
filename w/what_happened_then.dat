25|$|The Baudelaires {{go see the}} Quagmires {{and tell}} them <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> <b>Then</b> the Quagmires plot a plan. The Quagmires {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's the Quagmires that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus {{so that they can}} study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>then</b> she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E
2500|$|After some {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} the Virgin Mary had promised a miracle for {{the last of her}} apparitions on 13 October, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathered at Cova da Iria. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then</b> became known as the [...] "Miracle of the Sun".|$|E

2500|$|On 23 December, losing patience, {{the leaders}} of the {{division}} went to the Reichskanzlei (Chancellery). By that point, the government, the six-man [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] that had been in office since 10 November, {{was on the verge of}} breaking apart with increasing differences emerging between its USPD and SPD members. The Volksmarinedivision encountered support from the former but mostly hostility from the latter. The soldiers were ordered to hand over the keys to the Schloss and left. In the afternoon the soldiers' leaders returned, with the keys but also with a group of armed troops that took position in front of the building. According to historian Sebastian Haffner <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then</b> was as follows: The soldiers' leaders under one Lieutenant Heinrich Dorrenbach gave the keys to Emil Barth, a People's Deputy of the USPD. Barth called Wels and told him that he had received the keys and asked him to hand over the outstanding pay. Wels refused, arguing that he only took orders from Friedrich Ebert who was joint chairman of the [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] and had also been handed the authority of government by the last Imperial Chancellor, Maximilian of Baden. When Barth sent the soldiers to Ebert, Ebert refused to see them. On Dorrenbach's orders the troops now closed all access to the Reichskanzlei, occupied the room with the telephone switchboard and cut the lines. The Volksbeauftragten were thus under house arrest.|$|E

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then</b> I cannot exactly say. I saw my {{opponent}} spring forward like a panther and whirl his racquet. The next moment the back net was shaking violently, {{and the ball}} was rolling swiftly along the ground on a return journey to the other court.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} I could not {{recollect}} <b>what</b> had <b>happened.</b> <b>Then</b> things {{came to me}} slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.|$|R

It ain't going to help Irene any for you to hurt yourself--or anybody else; and I don't want you should take up with any such crazy notion.

60|$|When the {{children}} were in bed, sometimes Anna and he sat and talked, desultorily, both of them idle. He read very little.

6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} well <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then</b> {{for what}} seemed a long, long time. I can feel how the place looked, but not so clear {{as it is now}} in my dreams.

6000|$|Harris {{was silent}} for a while. At last he put his {{cigarette}} out and turned toward the youth. [...] "All right, let's say you give up your job and sit in the sun.

60|$|It's because I {{thought he}} was to blame that I sent him back alone. I wanted to give you another chance.

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then</b> {{is still}} a blurred picture in my brain. I know that Cynthia was shot from under me before she had taken her leap, and we fell heavily together. And I was {{scarcely}} up again and my sword drawn, when the villains were pressing me from all sides. I remember spitting but one, and then I heard a great seafaring oath, the first word out of their mouths, and I was felled from behind with a mighty blow.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, dear, {{how little}} {{we were expecting}} <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>then!</b> We were aghast to hear her say what she said.

When the spokesman had finished, she raised her head and set her calm eye on those faces, not any more disturbed by their state and grandeur than a princess would have been, and said, with all her ordinary simplicity and modesty of voice and manner: ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Pop {{songs are}} struggles, {{conscious}} or not, between the artist's urge {{to do her}} own thing and the audience's desire for familiar satisfactions. How many stylistic tics before the big chorus? How much individual versus how much mass appeal?

60|$|I stood, {{with the}} hatful of berries in my hand, like a stiff wax {{figure in a}} museum. The {{expected}} had come at last; and how little do we expect the expected when it comes!

And I must have cut a ridiculous figure indeed, though I have since been informed on good authority {{that this was not}} so.

60|$|A fatal {{discredit}} fastened upon a {{book which}} yet had in {{it so much}} of the root of the matter, from the unfortunate circumstance that Helvétius tacked the principle of utility on to the very crudest farrago {{to be found in the}} literature of psychology. <b>What</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>then,</b> was that Rousseau swept into the field with a hollow version of a philosophy of reform, so eloquently, loftily, and powerfully enforced as to carry all before it. The democracy of sentimentalism took the place that ought to have been filled in the literature of revolutionary preparation by the democracy of utility. Rousseau's fiction of the Sovereignty of the People was an arbitrary and intrinsically sterile rendering of the real truth in Helvétius's ill-starred book.|$|E
