Charles Warren thought that the altar of burnt offerings was located at the north western end.|$|E

Glenn Swan of AllMusic described the album's mixture of genres as [...] "a sort of electronic hybrid that had listeners simultaneously scratching their heads", while Jess Harvell of Pitchfork {{stated that the}} audience will [...] "hear {{the beginnings of a}} still-thriving genre that remains slippery and unnamed, purely electronic music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> tangy rock aftertaste." ...|$|E

500|$|SFX Magazine Jordan Farley {{gave the}} episode 3 {{and a half}} out of 5 stars, saying the {{direction}} [...] "never quite [...] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare" [...] and the camera was [...] "a little flat" [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> angle. He was displeased with the discovery that {{it had all been}} a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock in the way you might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a lot of fun to watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E

Data (Brent Spiner) at one of the science stations, the energy sparks between her and the console, leaving her confused as to why she is on the bridge.|$|E

[...] Kano still believes in things she was told by her older sister Hijiri as a child as a way of coping with her past. The third and final heroine Yukito meets is a girl in Misuzu's class at school named Minagi Tohno, a top student in the school who is introverted as well. Until she met Yukito, her only friend was Michiru, with whom she often blows bubbles at the abandoned train station in town.|$|E

[...] The song developed from the band's interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as [...] "a kind of Afro-rhythmic piece" [...] and [...] "a study in rhythm." [...] The bass riff in the song, inspired by the bodhrán, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton's unused bass parts. Mullen's drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase [...] "Race against time". Bono said of the song, [...] "It {{reminds me of the}} desert. The desert is so empty, but it aches <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> kind of fullness."

500|$|The MAUD Committee {{was founded}} in June 1940. The Committee was {{originally}} {{a part of the}} Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence, but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The committee was initially named after its chairman, Thomson, but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark, Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> line: [...] "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing 'radium taken'. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation representing a codename and not an acronym. Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London. In addition to Thomson, its original members were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon. Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and William Haworth.|$|E

On June 12, at Slammiversary, Matt was defeated by Jeff in a Full Metal Mayhem match. On the June 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Matt was once again defeated by Jeff in a Six Sides of Steel match. On the June 28 episode of Impact Wrestling, Matt challenged Jeff to a final battle with the Hardy brand on the line, to take place at their home in Cameron, North Carolina the next week. On July 5, during special episode [...] "The Final Deletion", Matt defeated Jeff in the match to become sole owner of the Hardy brand, forcing Jeff to drop his last name and become referred to as [...] "Brother Nero". It was around this time that Matt's broken gimmick would become very popular due to his accent and over-the-top way of words, starting a slow face turn.|$|E

2500|$|An essay {{from the}} Kasshiyawa by Matsura Seizan also {{describes}} the ashinaga. [...] The essay documents a man's anecdotal account of an unfortunate encounter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> being.

[...] The man's servant then informs him that they had just seen an ashinaga, and that sightings of this yōkai always brought bad changes in weather.|$|E
2500|$|The {{description}} of Huns {{given by the}} Romans has prompted some historians to believe they were of East Asian origin. Denis Sinor, noting the paucity of anthropological evidence, wrote that [...] "there {{is no reason to}} question the basic accuracy of the western descriptions, and the absence of massive supporting evidence by physical anthropology cannot weaken the point they so tellingly make. It is the unusual that most attracts attention." [...] However, Austrian traveler Maenchen-Helfen wrote in the 20th century: Ammianus' description begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> misunderstanding... This was repeated by Claudian and Sidonius and reinterpreted by Cassiodorus. Ammianus' explanation of the thin beards is wrong. Like so many other people, the Huns inflicted wounds on their live flesh as a sign of grief when their kinsmen were dying.|$|E

2500|$|At {{first the}} new {{committee}} {{was named the}} Thomson Committee after its chairman, but this was soon exchanged for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. MAUD was assumed {{by many to be}} an acronym, however it is not. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. On 9 April 1940, the day Germany invaded Denmark, Niels Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> line [...] "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing 'radium taken'. Regardless of how crazy it seemed it was enough to cause concern in Britain. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and John Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named the MAUD Committee. Although the initials stood for nothing, it was officially the MAUD Committee, not the Maud Committee.|$|E
