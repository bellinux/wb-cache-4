Dove used {{a wide range of}} media, sometimes in unconventional combinations, to produce his abstractions and his abstract landscapes. Me and the Moon from 1937 {{is a good example of}} an Arthur Dove abstract landscape and has been referred to as one of the culminating works of his career. Dove did a series of experimental collage works in the 1920s.

Dove showed one painting, a large still life painted in France entitled “The Lobster”, which would be his last representational work. Stieglitz provided Dove with his first one-man show in 1912 at the 291. The show, which included a group of Dove's pastels that {{came to be known as}} [...] "The Ten Commandments", was the first public exhibition of abstract art by an American. In the two years after meeting Stieglitz, Dove became a leader in international art developments. From 1912 to 1946 Dove showed his work annually at Stieglitz’s galleries: 291, Intimate Gallery, and An American Place. Dove used a wide range of media over the course of his career, sometimes in unconventional combinations. During the 1920s Dove made many works on paper such as the pastel on paper, Nature Symbolized (or Reefs) from 1924. As stated above Dove did experimental collage works in the 1920s in works like The Critic, 1925, and The Intellectual 1925; and he experimented with techniques, combining paints like oil and/or tempera over a <b>wax</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Tanks, 1938 is an example of oil over a wax emulsion; commenting about Tanks, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts says: Set off by a halo of pale gray, the quivering structures almost seem to dematerialize and merge into the surrounding scenery, yet at the same time, they retain their hulking forms.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wax</b> <b>emulsion</b> is {{a stable}} mixture {{of one or}} more waxes in water. Waxes and water are {{normally}} immiscible but can be brought together stably by the use of surfactants and a clever preparation process. Strictly speaking a <b>wax</b> <b>emulsion</b> should be called a wax dispersion since the wax is solid at room temperature. However, because the preparation takes place above the melting point of the wax, the actual process is called emulsification, hence the name <b>wax</b> <b>emulsion.</b> In praxis, wax dispersion is used for solvent based systems.|$|E

Wax treated wood is designed for outdoor use, therefore it is of considerable importance to elucidate the influence of weathering on the photodegradation processes. It is presumed, that wax treatment will reduce water uptake and thus reduce or slow down photodegradation processes. In order to test this hypothesis, three types of <b>wax</b> <b>emulsions</b> at two different concentrations were vacuum impregnated into Norway spruce wood specimens: an <b>emulsion</b> of montan <b>wax</b> (LGE), an <b>emulsion</b> of polyethylene (WE 1) and an emulsion of oxidized polyethylene (WE 6) wax. The samples were exposed to artificial accelerated weathering (AAW) for 500 cycles. Before and after AAW colour, the contact angle of water and moisture content were determined. Chemical and morphological changes at exposed surfaces were also investigated with FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. In parallel, the uptake of <b>wax</b> <b>emulsions</b> and water into the axial surfaces of samples was determined with a tensiometer. The moisture content measurements showed that the best hydrophobic effect was achieved with LGE treated wood, where the lowest colour and FTIR changes were observed as well. These results were supported by tensiometer measurements as well. Presented data clearly showed that high loadings of waxes reduce or at least slow down weathering.

40|$|Boron {{biocides}} {{belong to}} {{the most frequently used}} ingredients of commercial wood preservatives. They are very effective fungicides and insecticides, but they do not react with wood and thus leach from it in wet applications. This fact signifi cantly limits use of boron compounds in the field of wood preservation. In order to reduce leaching of boric acid, the emulsion of polyethylene (WE 1) and an emulsion of oxidized polyethylene (WE 6) wax were combined with boric acid (cB = 0. 1 % or 0. 5 % of boron). Spruce wood specimens were vacuum impregnated and afterwards leached according to the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1, EN 1250 - 2 and EN 84 procedures. The results showed that the boron leaching is predominantly infl uenced by moisture content of wood during leaching, and furthermore by the concentration gradient (frequency of water replacement). The fact that the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 leaching procedure is less severe than other two methods is also refl ected in the results. The results of the EN 84 and ENV 1250 test are comparable, while the results of the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 testing are not in line with the other two methods. Considerable portions of boron are leached from wood in the first leaching cycles, already.
