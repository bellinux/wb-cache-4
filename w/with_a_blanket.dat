5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major {{issue with the}} fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission would make up for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E

25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} with pieces of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar so that it is visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> of pictures and patterns.|$|E

For the rest of Chile's wine regions, the Coastal Ranges serve a buffer from the current and also acts as a rain shadow.

25|$|Also {{to testify}} at the trial {{on behalf of the}} {{prosecution}} was Marjorie Barnes, who testified on July 30 to having observed Collins leaving his uncle's home carrying a laundry box covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> on either July 24 or 25, 1969. In addition, Mrs. Sandra Leik testified to Collins being given a key to the family home in order that he could feed the family's German shepherd. Mrs. Leik also testified to having cut her children's hair in her basement two days prior to she and her family embarking on their vacation, and that when they had returned home, she had noticed that several items from her basement had been moved, that she had discovered a wet, soiled cloth containing hair aside a laundry tub, and that other items—including a nearly-full bottle of ammonia—were missing. The same day, the head of the state police crime laboratory, Sgt. Kennard Christensen, testified as to the results of forensic tests conducted in the Leik family basement: the results of these tests confirmed evidence of bloodstains in four separate areas. In response to defense questioning, Sgt. Christensen further stated that although partial fingerprints had been discovered {{in the basement of the}} Leik family, no full fingerprints had been discovered in the basement which had not belonged to any Leik family member.|$|E

He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922, and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925. Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> refusal to consider their anti position, the Irish Times countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and [...] "crystallise" [...] the partition of Ireland.|$|E

500|$|Developmental {{psychologist}} Jean Piaget conducted {{experiments that}} collected behavioral tests on infants. Piaget studied object permanence by observing infants' reactions when a favorite object or toy was presented {{and then was}} covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> or removed from sight. Object permanence {{is considered to be}} one of the earliest methods for evaluating working memory. [...] An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try to grab the blanket off the toy. Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused. Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had [...] ceased to exist. Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because they knew it existed, but didn't know where it was. However, the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious. If an infant searched for the object, it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist.|$|E
500|$|During {{the attack}} Lee {{was shot in}} the leg; a bullet hit his left thigh and {{fractured}} his femur. He lay for three days between the lines having been given up for dead. A memorial service was held after the announcement of his death. After three days, Lee was found by the Germans and transported to hospital in Valenciennes. The ten-hour journey was initially made in the passenger compartment of a train, with sacks of straw, before he transferred to a Red Cross train at Lille. For the first week he was looked after by the French Red Cross, before the Germans took over. He remained in Valenciennes for six weeks, and remained bedridden for the duration of his stay. After this time, he was transferred to a second hospital in Hannover. For {{the first half of the}} two-day journey, Lee had to lie on a wooden seat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> under him and his leg in an iron case, which hurt his back significantly, and was provided with no food. The second half of the journey was completed on a Red Cross train. During his stay in Hannover, Lee began to heal quickly, but after receiving advice from a fellow prisoner, he greatly exaggerated the injury, and was selected to be returned to England. He began the journey on 1 October 1915, and boarded the boat for England five days later. Although Lee had amplified the severity of his injury, in England he discovered that one of his legs would be permanently shorter than the other, and he had suffered significant muscle death. He was told that he would neither be able to fight nor play cricket again. He was discharged from the army on 4 December 1915, and was eligible for the Silver War Badge to show that he had served honourably. [...] He later also received the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. After leaving the army, Middlesex paid for Lee to be treated by a specialist, and he was able to play a match for the Army Service Corps against Lancing College in early 1916, in which he scored a century.|$|E
