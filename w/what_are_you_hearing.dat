40|$|We {{present a}} tool for {{analyzing}} and editing audio signals in the visual domain. As visual representation we use spectrograms, which give descriptive information about the sound. This allows analysing and editing audio in a “what <b>you</b> see <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> ” style. Gabor analysis and synthesis serves as a basis to create images and recreate audio signals from the edited images in hi-fi quality. As the structures in the spectrogram are rather complex, image processing and computer vision methods are applied for smart user assisted editing. Templates based on sounds recorded under defined conditions are therefore used. This allows detecting, separating, eliminating and/or modifying audio objects supervised (interactively) or automatically. We further propose the usage of resolution zooming, to support manipulating the spectrogram of a signal at any chosen time-frequency resolution. ...|$|R

Karky called it as the [...] "most challenging song" [...] he had ever worked on. As {{some part of the}} film's story is about modeling, his team created a compilation of six-seven commercials that play to this song.

The five and a half minute track blends genres like pop, bhangra, opéra comique elements and electronic beats. In an interview with The Hindu, S.

The song slightly touches underlying feeling of romance. Portions of the track [...] "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" [...] sung only by Sunitha Sarathy were recorded on 14 February 2013. Rahman was supposed to have sung [...] "Ennodu Nee Irundhaal" [...] but chose Sid Sriram because the latter sang it well and Rahman felt that Sriram didn't earn the deserving recognition through track [...] "Adiye" [...] from Kadal, thus gave a second opportunity. Lyricist Madhan Karky's third song in the film was recorded by mid - September 2013.

40|$|In {{the digital}} age, {{increasing}} amounts of digitized music materials result in the need for automated management processes. Especially for libraries and other content-providing organizations holding large and due to ongoing digitization efforts steadily {{increasing amounts of}} digital copies of music materials, {{there is a high}} demand on automatisms to cope with the vast number of documents and streamline their processing. In this thesis, a digital library system for managing heterogeneous music collections is developed. The aforementioned heterogeneity refers to various document types and formats, as well as to different modalities, e. g., compact disc-audio recordings, scans of sheet music, and lyrics. The system offers a full-fledged, widely automated document processing chain: digitization, indexing, annotation, linking, access, and presentation. The system is implemented as a generic and modular music repository based on an extensible service-oriented architecture. As a particular benefit of the approach pursued in this thesis, the various documents, representing different aspects of a piece of music, are jointly considered in all stages of the document processing chain. Concerning retrieval functionalities, incorporated state-of-the-art music information retrieval techniques and adequately designed user interface components allow for integrated, synchronized, and multimodal presentation of documents (WYSIWYH: <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear),</b> cross-modal score- or lyrics-based navigation in audio and vice versa, as well as sophisticated cross- and multimodal retrieval.

As a part of the German PROBADO digital library initiative, with a view on practical application and integration into existing business processes, it is described how the framework is put into practice at the Bavarian State Library Munich which houses a music data stock whose volume is of internationally significant rank...|$|R
