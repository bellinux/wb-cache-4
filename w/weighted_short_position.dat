The major {{features of the}} algorithm are that the paths. defined do not form transient loops when weights change {{and the number of}} steps required to find new shortest paths when network links fail is less than for previous algorithms. Specifically, the worst case recovery time is proportional to the largest number of hops h in any of the <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> paths. For previous loop-free distributed algorithms this recovery time is proportional to h 2. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} an inverse {{problem of the}} <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> {{arborescence}} problem is discussed. That is, given a directed graph G {{and a set of}} nonnegative costs on its arcs, we need to modify those costs as little as possible to ensure that T, a given v 1 -arborescence of G, is the shortest one. It is found that only the cost of T needs modifying. An O(n 3) combinatorial algorithm is then proposed. This algorithm also gives an optimal solution to the inverse <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> path problem...|$|R

The running time is in O(zeta^{ 4 }n^ 4 /epsilon^ 2) where n is {{the complexity of}} T_ 1 and T_ 2 and zeta is the maximal ratio of the lengths of any pair of segments from T_ 1 and T_ 2. Furthermore, we give relations between <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> paths inside a single parameter cell C and the monotone free space axis of C. As a result we present a simple construction of <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> paths inside a parameter cell. Additionally, such a shortest path provides an optimal solution for the partial Fréchet similarity of segments for all leash lengths. These two aspects are {{related to each other}} and are of independent interest...|$|R

[...] If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.

Instead, the returns in the long positions are composed of the capital gains (the differences in prices), the coupon paid and the reinvestment of the coupon at the risk free rate. As our point of view is a fund manager who takes both positions with the fund’s endowment, neither long nor <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> need additional funding.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the nature}} (capital or revenue) {{of the proceeds}} arising {{from the use of}} <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in South African hedge fund fundamental paired trades. Hedge funds, which typically avail themselves of an array of alternative investment strategies such as short selling in addition to the traditional asset classes, were recently brought into the South African investment regulatory net. This was achieved by classifying regulated hedge funds as a separate category of collective investment scheme in terms of the CISCA. This categorisation brought regulated hedge funds into the ambit of section 25 BA of the Income Tax Act which carries an important distinction between amounts of a capital nature and amounts of a revenue nature. Given that hedge funds may use <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> for both profit-seeking and risk-mitigation purposes, the resulting proceeds from short sales could be capital or revenue in nature from a tax perspective based on the surrounding facts of the trade. The onus of discharging the proof that the proceeds resulting from a short sale are capital in nature is significant. The South African case law emphasises the importance of applying the various principles to the specific facts of the case. The importance of the dominant intention of the trade is highlighted, given the potentially competing purposes of profit-seeking and risk-mitigation present. Factors that should be analysed in such a scenario include the overall portfolio positioning, the size of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> relative to each other, the degree of specificity of the risk that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> purports to hedge against, the manner of re-investment of the short sale proceeds, the level of trading activity in the hedge fund, the level of <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the hedge fund, the absolute sizes of the long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the context of the}} overall portfolio, the exposure of the hedge fund to the long position after the close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position,</b> the manner of close out of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> and the holding period of the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b> While the analysis reveals factors that may be indicative of capital treatment, the classification of short sale proceeds as capital or revenue in nature remains a challenging task to undertake due to the potentially wide variety of facts and circumstances and the potential for undesirable consequences should an incorrect classification be made. Consequently, improved clarity through the provision of de jure guidance as to the nature of short sale proceeds would be welcome...|$|R

40|$|Recently many {{mutual funds}} have created hedge fund-like {{products}} for marketing to retail investors. This study empirically examines the value added for investors during the 2007 financial crisis from hedge fund-like mutual funds, including 130 / 30, market neutral, and long/short equity funds. Based {{on the information}} ratio, market neutral and long/short equity funds have higher risk-adjusted returns than a passive index fund. However, hedge fund-like mutual funds in general add no value for investors, based on either unconditional or conditional four-factor alphas, even in a down market. While <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> taken by these funds do generate alpha, the gain from <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> is not sufficiently large to offset the loss from long positions. Finally, the abnormal performance of <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> is attributable to managers’ characteristic-adjusted and industry-adjusted stock selection skills...|$|R

40|$|The Chicago Board of Trade Treasury Bond Futures Contract {{allows the}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> several {{delivery}} options {{as to when}} and with which bond the contract will be settled. The timing option allows the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> to choose any business day in the delivery month to make delivery. In addition, the contract settlement price is locked in at 2 : 00 p. m. when the futures market closes, despite the facts that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> need not declare an intent to settle the contract until 8 : 00 p. m. and that trading in Treasury bonds car, occur all day in dealer markets.

40|$|In this paper, a {{geometric}} {{shortest path}} problem in weighted regions is discussed. An arrangement of linesA, a source s, and a target t are given. The objec-tive {{is to find}} a <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> path, pist, from s to t. Existing approximation algorithms for <b>weighted</b> <b>shortest</b> paths work within bounded regions (typically triangulated). To apply these algorithms to unbounded regions, such as arrangements of lines, {{there is a need to}} bound the regions. Here, we present a minimal region that contains pist, called SP-Hull of A. It is a closed polygonal region that only depends on the geometry of the arrangement A and is independent of the weights. It is minimal in the sense that for any arrangement of lines A, it is possible to assign weights to the faces ofA and choose s and t such that pist is arbitrary close to the boundary of SP-Hull of A. We show that SP-Hull can be constructed in O(n logn) time, where n is the number of lines in the arrangement. As a direct conse-quence we obtain a shortest path algorithm for weighted arrangements of lines. ...|$|R
