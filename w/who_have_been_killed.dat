25|$|José Luis Romero (1967-around 30 December 2009), was a Mexican radio {{journalist}} for Línea Directa Radio and Radio Sistema del Noroeste in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico, and he {{was known}} for his reporting about drug trafficking. Romero was a journalist for roughly 20 years and had been with Línea Directa for ten years. He had been missing for two weeks until his body was found tortured and brutally murdered. Romero's murder, along with other Mexican journalists <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> during their job, was interpreted by CNN as intimidation toward journalists.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{reports on}} waste collection, note {{that being a}} garbage {{collector}} {{may be one of}} the most dangerous jobs in Iraq. Most of the 500 municipal workers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> in Baghdad since 2005 have been waste collectors. There are inadequate waste collection vehicles with only 380 presently in service. Before the invasion there were 1200 working trucks. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized the capital after the American invasion. The deputy mayor of Baghdad estimates the city needs 1,500 waste collection vehicles.|$|E

25|$|One {{of three}} mission {{outcomes}} is possible: either the human forces are eliminated, the alien forces are neutralized, or the player chooses to withdraw. The mission's score {{and the result}} {{are based on the}} number of X-COM operatives lost (either dead, unconscious, or under alien control), civilians saved or perished, aliens killed or captured, and the number and quality of alien artifacts obtained. Troops may also increase in rank or abilities if they made successful use of their primary attributes (e.g. killing enemies). Instead of gaining experience points, surviving human combatants might get an automatic rise (a semi-random amount depending on how much of the action in which they participated) to their attributes, such as Psi or Accuracy. The soldiers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> on a mission will remain dead, but can be replaced with raw recruits back at base. In addition to combat personnel, the player may use unmanned ground vehicles that are outfitted with heavy weapons and well armored but large, costly, and not gaining experience. Recovered alien artifacts can then be researched and possibly reproduced. Captured live aliens may produce information, possibly leading to new technologies and even an access to psionic warfare.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the deadliest}} Indian wars fought was the Snake War in 1864–1868, which was {{conducted}} by a confederacy of Northern Paiute, Bannock and Shoshone Native Americans, called the [...] "Snake Indians" [...] against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River. The war started when tension arose between the local Indians and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Indians included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the Snake River Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and {{the intervention of the}} United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed,</b> wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War was widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.|$|E

2500|$|The {{infected}} (voiced by experimental musician Mike Patton {{and voice}} actor Fred Tatasciore) are the survivors' foes in Left 4 Dead, and {{they appear to}} be partly inspired by the infected from several modern films, including Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and Quarantine. An important distinction from the former is that while the infected do resemble traditional undead zombies, they are, as cited in the game's manual, living humans infected with a rabies-like pathogen, very much like the infected in the later two films. While they are never seen eating human flesh or brains, multiple 'survivors' <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> by the infected appear throughout the game, and appear to have been partially eaten.

60|$|My {{aunt was}} a lady of large frame, strong mind, and great resolution; she was {{what might be}} termed a very manly woman.
