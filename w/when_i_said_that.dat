2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby", [...] "Trapped", and [...] "If My Homie Calls".|$|E
2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we should break up." ...|$|E

"I want {{to finish}} this matter up," [...] Francis {{continued}} calmly, [...] "by making a clean breast of it to you, because from to-night I am starting afresh, with new interests in my life, what will practically amount to a new career. That is why I preferred not to dine at the club to-night, although I {{am looking forward to}} seeing them all again. I wanted instead to have this conversation with you.

500|$|Santiago, {{rather than}} {{listening}} to popular radio, borrowed {{rock and roll}} records from the public library as he was growing up; he first discovered Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix, who led to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Santiago later commented on Montgomery's influence: [...] "And <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Ah, <b>that's</b> a hook. That's some hooky stuff in the jazz world'". He discovered jazz and country artists such as Joe Pass and Chet Atkins after studying the liner notes of albums. [...] Santiago was directly influenced by the [...] "Hendrix chord", the sharp 9th dominant chord which, {{in the words of}} author Ben Sisario, [...] "tapped a hidden rage that matched the horror of Thompson's scream". As a teenager, Santiago also listened to classic rock and protopunk artists such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop.|$|R
