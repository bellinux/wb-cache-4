5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts an immune response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E

25|$|Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 {{weeks of}} age, {{although}} production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age. This {{means that in}} many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although chickens <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> live for 6 or more years. In some countries, hens are force moulted to re-invigorate egg-laying.|$|E
25|$|Anodizing is very {{resilient}} to weathering and corrosion, so it {{is commonly}} used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned frequently. If left without cleaning, panel edge staining <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> occur. Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it.|$|E

25|$|At {{any given}} instant, the {{electron}} <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> be pushed towards the lower-voltage {{side of the}} tube. The electron will then oscillate {{back and forth as}} the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.|$|E
25|$|Oysters {{can contain}} harmful bacteria. Oysters are filter feeders, so <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> {{concentrate}} anything {{present in the}} surrounding water. Oysters from the Gulf Coast of the United States, for example, contain high bacterial loads of human pathogens in the warm months, most notably Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In these cases, the main danger is for immunocompromised individuals, {{who are unable to}} fight off infection and can succumb to septicemia, leading to death. Vibrio vulnificus is the most deadly seafood-borne pathogen.|$|E
25|$|In operation, CAS latency is a {{specific}} number of clock cycles programmed into the SDRAM's mode register and expected by the DRAM controller. Any value may be programmed, but the SDRAM will not operate correctly if it is too low. At higher clock rates, the useful CAS latency in clock cycles naturally increases. 10–15ns is 2–3 cycles (CL2–3) of the 200MHz clock of DDR-400 SDRAM, CL4-6 for DDR2-800, and CL8-12 for DDR3-1600. Slower clock cycles <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> allow lower numbers of CAS latency cycles.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} Platycerium are solitary having only one rhizome. Other species form colonies when their {{rhizomes}} branch or when new rhizomes are formed from root tips. If {{the conditions are}} right the spores <b>will</b> germinate <b>naturally</b> on surrounding trees. Platycerium gametophytes are a small heart-shaped thallus.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of birds, the GPS unit must be very {{lightweight}} to avoid interfering with the bird's ability to fly or swim. The device is usually attached by gluing or, for short deployments, taping to the bird. The unit <b>will</b> then <b>naturally</b> fall off when the bird next moults.|$|R
25|$|Typefaces {{may also}} be {{designed}} differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as the ink <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which the ink will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on high-gloss cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.|$|E
25|$|Sharad Joshi, {{founder of}} Shetkari Sangathana (farmers association), has {{announced}} {{his support for}} retail reforms. Joshi claims FDI will help the farm sector improve critical infrastructure and integrate farmer-consumer relationship. Today, the existing retail {{has not been able}} to supply fresh vegetables to the consumers because they have not invested in the backward integration. When the farmers' produce reaches the end consumer directly, the farmers <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> be benefited. Joshi feels retail reform is just a first step of needed agricultural reforms in India, and that the government should pursue additional reforms.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is stored}} in the liver, the {{pancreas}} and the heart. Long-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated. For example, similar to alcoholism, haemochromatosis can cause cirrhosis of the liver. The liver is a primary storage area for iron and <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver {{is likely to be}} damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) and stomach (gastric varices) and severe fluid retention in the abdomen (ascites). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even coma (hepatic encephalopathy).|$|E

25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the clutched system, however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking. This {{can be used on}} lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the application of braking, but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Nintendo Gamer in June 2012, series producer Hiroyuki Takahashi spoke {{about the possibility of}} a fourth Golden Sun game; [...] "A big reason for us making RPGs comes from the requests from all the people who have enjoyed our RPGs in the past. Perhaps if there are enough Nintendo users asking for another game in the Golden Sun series, then this <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> lead to the development of such a game." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc Miller, an {{original}} creator of Traveller, {{wrote in a}} letter of introduction to this game, [...] "I've always said that Traveller would make the perfect computer game for the same two reasons that it's a great role-playing game: rules and background. The background, and its wealth of detail, <b>will</b> <b>naturally</b> capture the interest of players. But it's the simplicity of the rules which makes the computerization possible." [...] After Paragon Software acquired the video game rights to Traveller from Game Designers Workshop, Miller contributed [...] "generous support and research material" [...] to Paragon's development efforts.|$|E
