5|$|The {{central area}} of the city serves as a {{satellite}} of nearby Nagoya, which has larges offices of many international companies, including Toyota. The ease of commute between the two cities, {{as well as the}} plentiful apartment construction underway, has contributed to this distinction. Just west of Gifu Station is Gifu City Tower 43, a 43-story high-rise building developed by Takenaka Corporation that opened on October 13, 2007 as the tallest building in Gifu Prefecture. The upper 30 floors are divided into two- and three-bedroom apartments, including those for senior citizens. The lower floors <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> offices or shops for targeted services such as medical care. Additionally, public space exists {{at the top of the}} building, allowing residents another 360-degree view of Gifu, complementing that offered from Gifu Castle.|$|E
5|$|Innovation Park and Ignition Park, dual-certified {{technology}} parks, {{have already}} attracted technology businesses to South Bend. Located {{across the street}} from the University of Notre Dame, Innovation Park was completed in 2009 and houses innovative researchers from companies and the university. Ignition Park, located just south of the downtown area, is planned to become home to 3 million square feet of high tech space on 140 acres of land previously owned by the Studebaker Corporation. The first tenant, Data Realty, moved into the location in the fall of 2012. The second building in the new park <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a research and testing facility for massive turbo machinery as part of a partnership between the city, General Electric, Great Lakes Capital, Indiana Michigan Power, University of Notre Dame, and the state of Indiana. This project began construction in 2015 and is expected to have an economic impact of $15 million annually.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} types of cis-acting RNA {{sequence}} elements present in pre-mRNAs and they have corresponding trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Splicing silencers are sites to which splicing repressor proteins bind, reducing {{the probability that a}} nearby site <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a splice junction. These can be located in the intron itself (intronic splicing silencers, ISS) or in a neighboring exon (exonic splicing silencers, ESS). They vary in sequence, {{as well as in the}} types of proteins that bind to them. The majority of splicing repressors are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNPA1 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Splicing enhancers are sites to which splicing activator proteins bind, increasing the probability that a nearby site <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a splice junction. These also may occur in the intron (intronic splicing enhancers, ISE) or exon (exonic splicing enhancers, ESE). Most of the activator proteins that bind to ISEs and ESEs are members of the SR protein family. Such proteins contain RNA recognition motifs and arginine and serine-rich (RS) domains.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the draft the Rams {{selected}} Cornerback Jonathan Wade from Tennessee in the third round. With a 4.4second 40-yard dash, Wade will add some speed at the cornerback position. In the fifth round the Rams selected Center Dustin Fry out of Clemson. With Andy McCollum and Brett Romberg competing for the starting position at Center, Fry will likely be the third stringer at that position. Later in the fifth round the Rams selected Defensive Tackle Clifton Ryan from Michigan State. The Rams stated that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a Nose Tackle. In the sixth round the Rams selected Offensive Tackle Ken Shackleford from Georgia. Coach Linehan commented that he could develop into a starter over the next couple of years.

25|$|From 2021, choice {{will matter}} {{when it comes}} to {{secondary}} school admissions. Pupils will get a choice of six schools and have to rank these choices in order of their preference.

For the Normal (Academic) stream, a score of 25 or less is needed, and for the Normal (Technical) stream, a score of 30 or less.|$|E
25|$|The {{band members}} were modeled using motion {{capturing}} performed by actors hired by Harmonix, incorporating video and concert footage to create avatars for each member unique to each venues. The band's support team helped to take {{photographs of the}} band member's tattoos, and identified when they were received so that the Harmonix artists could incorporate them properly into the avatars. All the songs, including the six Green Day songs previously released as downloadable content, feature unique animations tied to each song. This was a different approach than as taken for The Beatles: Rock Band, where they created snippets of framing and animation which could be easily repackaged for other songs, including future downloadable content. Because of the integrated nature of the songs and animations, {{there will be no}} further downloadable content available for the game. The game includes, as reward items, over 100 photographs and 40 minutes of video footage pulled from Warner Bros. Records' archive of the band. The video content has been pared down from over 20 hours of raw footage from concerts and studio records. Some of the live video footage <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> part of the 21st Century Breakdown venue backdrops. Many of these rewards are specific to individual songs, such as photos taken during concert performances of the song, and thus given as rewards for completing these songs.|$|E
