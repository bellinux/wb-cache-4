500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males {{over the age of}} 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E
6000|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> well {{might have}} {{passed and the}} ending have come - Points in my path when the dark might have stolen on me, artless, unrueing - Ere I had learnt {{that the world was}} a welter of futile doing: Such had <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> well might have passed, and the ending have come! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was pleased}} with the compliment. There had <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hardly thought that Poirot {{appreciated}} me at my true worth.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{anything}} to forgive. There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{thought you did}} care. I've deceived myself, that's all. Goodbye, Anne." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Godric came as mysteriously {{alive for}} me as Bebb had and, with him, all the people he knew and the whole medieval world he lived in. I had Godric narrate his own life, and despite the problem of {{developing}} a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic, and despite the difficulties of trying to recapture {{a time and place}} so unlike my own, the book, like Lion Country before it, came so quickly and with such comparative ease that there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> suspected that maybe the old saint himself was not entirely uninvolved in the process, as, were I a saint and were somebody writing a book about me, I would not be entirely uninvolved in the process either." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{sudden death}} of her partner Julius Robertson {{of a heart attack}} in November 1961 marked a turning point for Dovey Roundtree, who as an African American woman found herself a sole {{practitioner}} in a legal community still dominated by men. [...] "At a time when a female lawyer of any race was regarded skeptically, I'd derived a significant measure of credibility from my association with Julius," [...] she later wrote, adding that in the wake of Robertson's death, [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt truly vulnerable." [...] Sustained by her ordination into the ministry of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on November 30, 1961, Dovey Roundtree went on to build a thriving law practice, working as a sole practitioner for nine years before founding a second law firm, Roundtree Knox Hunter and Parker, in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls {{were kind of}} closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll try not to," [...] he answered. [...] "Perhaps I'm {{incapable}} of it; I'm not progressive. Still, there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel rather old." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawson, with {{a curious}} half-smile, broke the silence. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wish I owned a Gatling gun {{and knew how}} to use it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "there have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have cursed {{myself for}} a fool, but, on the whole, {{sentiment}} keeps many fires burning." ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> walked weeping {{through that}} {{brightness}} that was neither night nor day. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> reasoned in a topsy-turvy fashion with what I called the Spirit of All Things. But always I spoke to that white glory in the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have been}} so silly!" [...] she confessed. [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> couldn't believe that you were my Everard--mine! And now I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> doubted sadly if {{he would}} [...] "hang on." [...] As the winter wore away he grew frailer and frailer. But ever {{he looked forward to}} the coming of spring and [...] "the book," [...] his book, {{transformed}} and glorified.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] Wingrave admitted, [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{fear that}} we shall not get on together. I begin to suspect {{that you have a}} conscience." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped with}} another laugh {{that had a}} faintly suggestive ring in it. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somebody}} else who hadn't a penny!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{dropped his}} cigar, and laughed a little. [...] "Well, I'm talking {{like a fool}} again. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can't help it. It's a way of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, quietly, [...] "it {{was a great}} responsibility, {{and there}} <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was horribly afraid. Still, events have proved me right, and I {{think it is the}} {{greatest}} compliment I could pay you when I say that it was to make Carrie safe I did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I love you," [...] he said; [...] "I {{have known}} it since I have known you, but you must see why I could not tell you so. It was very hard, for there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> led myself {{to believe that you}} might come to love me. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> should have gone away if I hadn't made a promise to stay in Ripton. I ask you to marry me, because I--know that I shall love you as long as I live. I can give you this, at least, and I can promise to protect and cherish you. I cannot give you that to which you have been {{accustomed}} all your life, that which you have here at Fairview, but I shouldn't say this to you if I believed that you cared for them above--other things." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Edith Croyden, I {{can only}} say that as she stood beside me on the beach in her suit of black {{goatskin}} (she had chosen the black spots) there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt like seizing her in the frenzy of my passion and hurling her into the sea. Fur always acts on me just like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I got it for myself," [...] {{she said}} coldly. [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{have felt that}} the {{possession}} of something of that sort was an absolute necessity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, father," [...] she sighed, {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very {{dissatisfied}} with myself, and to-night, I am afraid, {{is one of}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The spirit for adventure," [...] Arnold {{repeated}} quietly. [...] "Well, {{there have}} <b>been</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought I had that, {{but it certainly}} {{never occurred to me}} to go out and rob." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--though {{it is good}} of you to say so. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{tried to}} fancy I was running the contract, but that was just a sick man's craze. You have played out the game well and bravely, Geoffrey, as only a true man could. Perhaps Helen will thank you--just now I don't feel quite equal to it." ...|$|E
60|$|Odd, {{the poor}} opinion a man always has--when {{he is in}} love--of his {{personal}} attractions. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought of Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I felt {{like one of the}} beasts that perish. But then, I'm nothing to write home about, whereas the smallest gleam of intelligence should have told Wilton that he was a kind of Ouida guardsman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing;--except {{being the}} Prime Minister's wife; and upon my word there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> didn't like that very much. I don't know {{anything}} else that I'm fit for. I wonder whether Mr. Gresham would {{let me go to}} him as housekeeper? Only we should have to lend him Gatherum, or there would be no room for the display of my abilities. Is Mr. Monk in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I {{understand}} it all. But there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel bitterly {{the necessity of}} remaining in hiding, as if I {{was in fact a}} criminal. Have you any more news?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAN. So {{like you}} that there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> almost wish I had never met you. You set me {{thinking}} about myself, {{and that is a}} subject I find it pleasanter to forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Perhaps {{even now}} {{it is only a}} mood with me. I can only speak as I feel for the moment. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel differently, but not now." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{while there}} <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> rejoiced {{in the idea}} that my sufferings were to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning. Now I find hidden somewhere away in my nature {{something}} that tells me that nothing {{in the whole world}} is meaningless, and suffering least of all. That something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility.|$|E
60|$|Somehow, {{her stories}} began to affect me {{in spite of}} myself. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt very dreary. Perhaps Aunt Philippa was right. Perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy. Certainly Mark had {{forgotten}} me. I was ashamed of myself because this hurt me so much, but I could not help it. I grew pale and listless. Aunt Philippa sometimes peered at me sharply, but she held her peace. I was grateful for this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{generally}} {{there was}} little excitement. I did not, as you can suppose, take the sensation line; spoke very rapidly, for I {{had no time to}} spare--but clearly and quietly, sometimes gravely, sometimes with exceeding earnestness, and exposed sophistries and fallacies and errors about the incapacity of the black races, &c. There <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lost all sense of nervousness and self, and only wished that 10,000 people had been present, for I felt that I was speaking out, face to face, plain simple words of truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looking for work!" [...] snorted Mrs. Wilkins with contempt; [...] "we women never 'ave much {{difficulty}} in finding it, I've noticed. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel I {{could do with}} losing it for a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one, Mr. Burns," [...] I said. [...] "There is no {{breath to}} spare on board this ship for that. Are {{you aware that}} there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can't muster more than three hands to do anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How low you are!" [...] {{she simply}} said. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> despair of you. He's {{in every way}} your superior, and I like him so that--well, he must like HER. Make him feel that he does." ...|$|R
