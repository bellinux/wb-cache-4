40|$|A {{subcutaneous}} electrode structure {{suitable for}} a chronic implant and for taking a low noise electrocardiogram of an active animal, comprises a thin inflexible, smooth disc of stainless steel having a diameter as of 5 to 30 mm, which is sutured in place to the animal being monitored. The disc electrode includes a radially directed slot extending in from {{the periphery of the}} disc for approximately 1 / 3 of the diameter. Electrical connection is made to the disc by means of a flexible lead wire that extends longitudinally of the slot and is woven through apertures in the disc and held at the terminal end by means of a spot welded tab. Within the slot, an electrically insulative sleeve, such as silicone rubber, is placed over the wire. The wire with the sleeve mounted thereon is captured in the plane of the disc and within the slot by means of crimping tabs extending laterally of the slot and over the insulative wire. The marginal lip of the slot area is apertured and an electrically insulative potting material such as silicone rubber, is potted in place overlaying the <b>wire</b> <b>slot</b> region and through the apertures...|$|E
40|$|The transmission-line {{modelling}} (TLM) {{method is}} applied to 3 -dimensional problems in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The method {{is found to be}} a versatile tool which is ideally suited to the modelling of many EMC systems. A new way of deriving the scattering properties of the TLM node is presented and the derivation of mesh parameters, the application of boundary conditions and methods of applying excitation and of taking outputs are described. Issues regarding the efficient implementation of the TLM algorithm and a way of running very large simulations are reported. A multigrid method is introduced which allows meshes of different resolutions to be connected together to form a complete system. The method is used to apply fine resolution only in areas where it is required and to move numerical boundaries away from the region of interest. Comparisons are made with the more traditional graded mesh technique, using the hybrid node. Results are presented for a number of different systems with particular emphasis on the environment in which radiated emission tests are undertaken, although more general systems are also considered. The consequences of making measurements in an unlined screened room are discussed and ways of damping resonances are investigated. <b>Wire,</b> <b>slot</b> and spherical dipole antennas are modelled. Field-to-wire coupling, the TEM cell, a simplified device under test, the shielding properties of a vehicle body and the current induced by a simplified table-top device are also considered. Techniques are developed to obtain the Q factor of a screened room loaded with radiation absorbing material (RAM) and to obtain the radiation resistance of an antenna in free-space and also in close proximity to conducting surfaces...|$|E

Considering the wide variety of vehicles on the road today, it has become increasingly important to find a loop configuration that can accurately detect oddsized vehicles.

40|$|The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District diverts up to 1400 cfs {{into its}} main canal {{system on the}} lower Yellowstone River in Northeastern Montana. In late 2010, {{as part of a}} pallid {{sturgeon}} recovery program, the USBR and USACE began construction of a new state-of-the-art screened canal head works structure. After over 100 years of unscreened operations, the new fish screened facility was opened in spring 2012. The head works will be integrated into a major river gradient fish passage facility being proposed for construction soon. When completed, the new passage and protection facilities will reduce fish entrainment and open an additional 165 miles of river habitat for the endangered and native fishes. The new headwork facility’s fish protection system consists of twelve, 6. 5 -foot diameter and 25 feet long cylindrical fish protection screens. Each screen is designed to seal over the intake’s submerged sluice gates spaced along the 350 -foot long riverbank facility. An integrated and flush-mounted track system was built into the vertical concrete walls to raise the screens in the non-irrigation season for protection from the significant ice and flood flows common on the river. When the 71 -mile long irrigation canal is operational, each screen is lowered into position and an automatic brush cleaning system is used to keep the 1. 75 mm wedge <b>wire</b> <b>slots</b> from clogging. The new intake facility was physically modeled at the USBR Hydraulics Lab along with several river fish passage options. The on-river screen design keeps the fish and debris in the river as opposed to traditional off-river screen designs with fish bypass facilities. The cylindrical design also reduced the facility footprint and allows diversions to occur over the river’s wide-ranging water surface fluctuations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the dimensions and surface characteristics of orthodontic <b>wires</b> and bracket <b>slots</b> of different commercial brands. METHODS: Thirty metallic brackets (0. 022 x 0. 028 -in and 0. 022 x 0. 030 -in) were divided in three groups: DYN/ 3 M group = Dyna-Lock, 3 M/Unitek (stainless steel, or SS); STD/MO group = Slim Morelli (SS); and Ni-Free/MO group = Slim Morelli (Ni-Free). The stainless steel wires (0. 019 x 0. 025 in) were divided into two groups: MO group = Morelli; and 3 M group = 3 M/Unitek. The bracket and wire measurements were done by two methods: (a) Surface Electron Microscopy (SEM), and (b) Profile projection. The surface analysis was done qualitatively, based on SEM images and/or by a rugosimeter. The quantitative results were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's test (p < 0. 05) and Student's t test. RESULTS: A significant difference in the dimensions of slots was observed, and the NiFree/MO group showed the greatest changes when compared to the other groups. The analysis of surface topography of the brackets indicated greater homogeneity of the metallic matrix for DYN/ 3 M and STD/MO groups.

By achieving momentum matching of the waveguides {{through an}} orthogonal junction placement, and maximizing modal overlap through an angled facet, coupling efficiency of ∼ 70 % and 3 -dB bandwidth of over 500 nm has been achieved. The nominal ex-perimental transmission through cascaded input (Si wire to SSW) and output (SSW to Si wire) orthogonal junctions match closely those obtained from simulations, {{both in the}} range from 1270 to 1360 nm and from 1480 to 1590 nm. For slot widths ranging from 30 to 230 nm, our Si wire-SSW bend can achieve coupling effi-ciency comparable to that of a direct butt-coupler over a 400 nm bandwidth.

30|$|The wire can be ligated to the bracket {{by means}} of metal {{ligature}} (ML) of different diameters, elastomeric ligature (EL), or by the specific closure system {{in the case of}} self-ligating brackets (SLB) [13]. Among the EL, the most common way to tie is the “ring” shape. Another tying option with elastomeric ligatures is the “figure 8 ” shape, which promotes greater pressure of the <b>wire</b> in the <b>slot,</b> increasing friction [14 – 17]. EL properties include light continuous force, consistent long-lasting seating archwire, resistance to water sorption, and shape memory [13]. Furthermore, they can be applied quickly, are comfortable for the patient, and have a variety of colors. However, the EL allows greater microbial accumulation {{on the surface of the}} teeth adjacent to the bracket, compared to the other ligation types, besides the fact that the archwires may not completely seat during torquing or rotational corrections, and binding may occur with sliding mechanics [13, 18 – 20]. Few studies have evaluated the influence of the ligation type in the force exerted by the wire on the tooth [6, 11, 12].|$|R
40|$|A novel {{composite}} right/left-handed leaky-wave antenna (CRLH LWA), {{based on}} periodically loaded parallel-plate waveguides (PPW) is presented.

The coupling between the antenna and freespace is rigourously modeled using a mode-matching technique, combined with the Floquet’s theorem. This provides a lossy dispersive CRLH unit-cell model, whose values are obtained using a quickly-convergent iterative algorithm.

METHODS: The fretting test set-up used allowed to control on-line the contact configuration and the positioning of the contacting parts. A specific positioning method was used to achieve a parallel alignment of arch <b>wire</b> and bracket <b>slot.</b> The effect of arch wire size, roughness, and test environment were investigated. RESULTS: It {{was found that the}} aqueous solutions act as a lubricant compared to air. Friction was affected by the arch wire width while the roughness was found to have a limited effect. Stainless steel 0. 018 '' x 0. 025 '' arch wires exhibited higher frictional forces than stainless steel 0. 017 '' x 0. 025 '' arch wires on sliding against stainless steel 0. 018 '' x 0. 025 '' brackets in the selected test environments when tested under identical fretting test conditions. The wear damage on the arch wire after these in-vitro fretting tests was investigated.

40|$|Nowadays, silicon {{photonics}} is {{a widely}} studied research topic. Its high-index-contrast and compatibility with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology make it a promising platform for low cost high density integration. Several general problems have been brought up, including the lack of silicon active devices, the difficulty of light coupling, the polarization dependence, etc. This thesis aims to give new attempts to novel solutions {{for some of these}} problems. Both theoretical modeling and experimental work have been done. Several numerical methods are reviewed first. The semi-vectorial finite-difference mode solver in cylindrical coordinate system is developed and it is mainly used for calculating the eigenmodes of the waveguide structures employed in this thesis. The finite-difference time-domain method and beam propagation method are also used to analyze the light propagation in complex structures. The fabrication and characterization technologies are studied. The fabrication is mainly based on clean room facilities, including plasma assisted film deposition, electron beam lithography and dry etching. The vertical coupling system is mainly used for characterization in this thesis. Compared with conventional butt-coupling system, it can provide much higher coupling efficiency and larger alignment tolerance. Two novel couplers related to silicon photonic wires are studied. In order to improve the coupling efficiency of a grating coupler, a nonuniform grating is theoretically designed to maximize the overlap between the radiated light profile and the optical fiber mode. Over 60 % coupling efficiency is obtained experimentally. Another coupler facilitating the light coupling between silicon photonic <b>wires</b> and <b>slot</b> waveguides is demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally. Almost lossless coupling is achieved in experiments. Two approaches are studied to realize polarization insensitive devices based on silicon photonic wires. The first one is the use of a sandwich waveguide structure to eliminate the polarization dependent wavelength of a microring resonator. By optimizing the multilayer structure, we successfully eliminate the large birefringence in an ultrasmall ring resonator. Another approach is to use polarization diversity scheme. Two key components of the scheme are studied. An efficient polarization beam splitter based on a one-dimensional grating coupler is theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated. This polarization beam splitter can also serve as an efficient light coupler between silicon-on-insulator waveguides and optical fibers. Over 50 % coupling efficiency for both polarizations and - 20 dB extinction ratio between them are experimentally obtained. A compact polarization rotator based on silicon photonic wire is theoretically analyzed. 100 % polarization conversion is achievable and the fabrication tolerance is relatively large by using a compensation method. A novel integration platform based on nano-epitaxial lateral overgrowth technology is investigated to realize monolithic integration of III-V materials on silicon. A silica mask is used to block the threading dislocations from the InP seed layer on silicon. Technologies such as hydride vapor phase epitaxy and chemical-mechanical polishing are developed. A thin dislocation free InP layer on silicon is obtained experimentally. QC 2010070...|$|R
