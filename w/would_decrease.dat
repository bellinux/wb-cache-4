5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} {{projects have been}} proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple Line has been in planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway. The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, the value would be {{determined}} by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|The main {{short-term}} {{danger to}} Enron's survival {{at the end}} of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade. Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption <b>would</b> <b>decrease.</b> However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E
5|$|Triton was {{discovered}} by William Lassell in 1846, just seventeen days after the discovery of Neptune. Nereid {{was discovered}} by Gerard P. Kuiper in 1949. The third moon, later named Larissa, was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to those discovered around Uranus four years earlier. If rings were present, the star's luminosity <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which meant that {{it was due to}} a moon rather than a ring.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, the {{composition}} of the infantry division gradually changed, and there was an increased emphasis on providing the infantry divisions with organic fire support. By 1918, a British division consisted of three infantry brigades, each of three battalions. Each of these battalions had 36 Lewis machine guns, making a total of 324 such weapons in the division. Additionally, there was a divisional machine gun battalion, equipped with 64 Vickers machine guns in four companies of 16 guns. Each brigade in the division also had a mortar battery with eight Stokes Mortars. The artillery also changed the composition of its batteries. At the start of the war, there were three batteries with six guns per brigade; they then moved to four batteries with four guns per brigade, and finally in 1917, to four batteries with six guns per brigade to economise on battery commanders. In this way, the army would change drastically over {{the course of}} the war, reacting to the various developments, from the mobile war fought in the opening weeks to the static trench warfare of 1916 and 1917. The cavalry of the BEF represented 9.28% of the army; by July 1918, it would only represent 1.65%. The infantry <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> from 64.64% in 1914 to 51.25% of the army in 1918, while the Royal Engineers would increase from 5.91% to 11.24% in 1918.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops <b>would</b> <b>decrease</b> capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E
