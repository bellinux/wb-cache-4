25|$|On January 13, 2014, Tesla {{recalled}} Model S vehicles {{manufactured in}} 2013, because the adapter, cord, or <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> could overheat during charging.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{ventilators}} typically require {{power by}} a battery or a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> (DC or AC) though some ventilators {{work on a}} pneumatic system not requiring power.|$|E
25|$|All {{but very}} old games use low DC {{voltages}} {{to power the}} solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.|$|E

2500|$|Oemtek {{offers a}} Valence powered lithium iron {{phosphate}} conversion that should provide [...] of all-electric range. The Motor Industry Research Association has announced a retrofit hybrid conversion kit that provides removable battery packs that plug into a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> for charging. Poulsen Hybrid {{is developing a}} conversion kit that will add through-the-road plug-in hybrid capability to conventional vehicles by externally mounting electric motors onto two of the wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Chromecast Ultra {{is similar}} in design to the second-generation model, but {{features}} upgraded hardware that supports the streaming of 4K resolution content, as well as high-dynamic range through the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Google stated that the Chromecast Ultra loads video 1.8 times faster than previous models. Unlike previous models that could be powered through a USB port, the Chromecast Ultra {{requires the use of}} the included power supply for connecting to a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet.</b> The power supply also offers an Ethernet port for a wired connection to accommodate the fast network speeds needed to stream 4K content.|$|E
2500|$|Voltage {{regulators}} or stabilizers {{are used}} to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. [...] Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet.</b> Automatic voltage regulators are used on generator sets on ships, in emergency power supplies, on oil rigs, etc. to stabilize fluctuations in power demand. For example, when a large machine is turned on, the demand for power is suddenly a lot higher. The voltage regulator compensates for the change in load. Commercial voltage regulators normally operate {{on a range of}} voltages, for example 150–240V or 90–280V. Servo stabilizers are also manufactured and used widely {{in spite of the fact}} that they are obsolete and use out-dated technology.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Iacocca {{became the}} head of EV Global Motors, a company formed to develop and market {{electric}} bikes with {{a top speed of}} 15mph and a range of 20 miles between recharging at <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b>|$|R
50|$|A highly {{fault-tolerant}} {{system might}} continue {{at the same}} level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> even if the grid power fails.|$|R

Concept meant to facilitate operation by patients whose disabilities {{make it difficult}} or impossible to maneuver common electrical plugs into or out of ac <b>wall</b> <b>outlets...</b>|$|R
2500|$|On August 15, 2010, {{one year}} and {{one day after the}} date his wedding was to have taken place, Markoff was found dead in his cell at Boston's Nashua Street Jail. The manner of death was later {{confirmed}} as suicide. Markoff reportedly wrote [...] "Megan", his former fiancee's name, and [...] "Pocket" [...] (their pet name for each other) in blood on the wall of his cell, and distributed photographs of his fiancee and the couple around the cell. [...] He then used a [...] "primitive scalpel", made from a prison issue pen and a piece of metal pried from a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet,</b> to cut major arteries in his ankles, legs, and neck. [...] After swallowing toilet paper to ensure that he could not be revived, he tightened a plastic bag over his head with gauze.|$|E
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as <b>wall</b> <b>outlet,</b> electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 1988, The Movie Channel debuted its [...] "eye and profile" [...] logo, which {{utilized}} various designs incorporating facial expressions, {{with the}} channel's name rendered in Helvetica Extended on tilted black bars {{at the top}} and bottom of the logo; some viewers have commented on online blogs and video websites such as YouTube that this logo, due to the eyes being prominently displayed, had frightened them as young children (this logo was replicated somewhat when WGN America used a logo featuring a set of female eyes rimmed with green mascara from 2008 to 2009). The channel ran different and unique feature presentation opens and network IDs during the nine-year period it was in use (among which included intros in which the logo changed facial expressions at the draw of a curtain, set to a bouncy keyboard tune; a grayscale version of the logo – which then winked – rotating to face the screen in front of a gray background accompanied by a steady drumbeat; and a live-action/partially computer-animated sequence set to Indiana Jones-style adventure music in which the logo shoots lasers from its eyes to escape from the newspaper it is printed on – which is set afire as kindling in a fireplace – and embarks on a calamity-filled journey through a family's living room, seen from its point of view, as it heads toward the safety of a TV set it rappels into on a cable hooked up to a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> above the fireplace's mantle).|$|E
50|$|Sub-micro AC drives {{belong to}} the class of {{electrical}} components primarily intended to convert voltage and current levels received from <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> to be compatible with motors built in another region (such as allowing motors built in France {{to run in the}} United States without major modification).|$|R
50|$|All {{electric}} scooters and motorcycles {{provide for}} recharging by plugging into ordinary <b>wall</b> <b>outlets,</b> usually taking about eight hours to recharge (i.e. overnight). Some manufacturers have designed in, included, or offer as an accessory, the high-power CHAdeMO level 2 charger, which can charge the batteries up to 95% in an hour.|$|R
50|$|The contestants in this {{challenge}} are tasked {{to build a}} triangular frame that would house a solar panel, which would power two lightbulbs and two <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> in their sheds, within 60 minutes. To help them, they are given one prototype frame from which they can take and copy their measurements.|$|R

50|$|The Johns Hopkins Beast was {{a mobile}} automaton, an early pre-robot, {{built in the}} 1960s at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The machine had a {{rudimentary}} intelligence {{and the ability to}} survive on its own. As it wandered through the white halls of the laboratory, it would seek black <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b> When it found one it would plug in and recharge.|$|R
50|$|Cable-ready {{television}} sets have coaxial cable F connectors. One end {{connects to the}} cable, antenna, or VHF jack {{on the back of}} the television set; the other end connects to the <b>wall</b> CATV <b>outlet.</b> Once the television is connected through the cable to the <b>wall</b> CATV <b>outlet,</b> the television will need to be programmed to receive the cable channels. The instruction manual that came with the television should have instructions on how to program cable channels.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, {{the terms}} jack plug and jack socket are {{commonly}} used for the respective male and female phone connectors. In the US, a stationary (more fixed) electrical connector is called a [...] "jack". The terms phone plug and phone jack are sometimes {{used to refer to}} different genders of phone connectors, but are also sometimes used colloquially to refer to RJ11 and older telephone plugs and the corresponding jacks that connect wired telephones to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Receptacle and outlet {{are common}} in American English, for {{household}} connectors, sometimes with qualifiers such as <b>wall</b> <b>outlet,</b> electrical outlet and electrical receptacle.|$|E

50|$|An AC {{power supply}} {{typically}} takes the voltage from a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> (mains supply) and lowers {{it to the}} desired voltage. Some filtering may take place as well.|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{charging}} {{requires a}} physical {{connection between the}} electronic device's battery and the power supply. The need for a metal-to-metal connection between the charger and the device requiring charging {{is one of the}} main drawbacks of this method. To accomplish this without the use of physical cords connected to <b>wall</b> <b>outlets,</b> special attachments are made from electronic devices which are fitted with technology that can detect when the device makes connection with the power source, often a charging base. Conduction based wireless accessories may include changeable backs for cellular phones, special sleeves and attachable clips.|$|R
50|$|According to {{corporate}} lore, Collins found his inspiration {{in a dramatic}} Alabama lightning storm. As he watched the electric discharges strike the ground, he imagined the dancing limbs of a powerful creature, one that could be harnessed {{in the service of}} the public. He turned to a colleague, APC engineer Dan Clinton, to create the first drawings of Reddy Kilowatt, an “electrical servant” with lightning bolt arms and legs, wearing safety gloves and shoes. He added a friendly face with a light bulb nose and <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> for ears.|$|R
50|$|Most modern North American {{homes are}} wired to receive 240 volts from the transformer, {{and through the}} use of {{split-phase}} electrical power, can have both 120 volt receptacles and 240 volt receptacles. The 120 volts is typically used for lighting and most <b>wall</b> <b>outlets.</b> The 240 volt outlets are usually placed where the oven and stovetop, water heater, and clothes dryer would go (if they are electric, rather than using natural gas). Sometimes a 240 volt outlet is mounted in the garage for machinery or for charging an electric car.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, MIRA has {{announced}} a retrofit hybrid conversion kit that provides [...] battery packs that plug into a <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> for charging. [...] Also XP Vehicles uses extension-cord-free charging hot-swap battery (removable power pack to recharge at home without extension cord).|$|E
50|$|In late July 2009 {{there was}} a recall due to a problem that was {{discovered}} with the camera's power systems. The flaw would cause the system to cease powering on, both when running on battery or <b>wall</b> <b>outlet</b> power. For affected serial numbers see Nikon advisory.|$|E
50|$|Segway Personal Transporters are two-wheeled, self-balancing, {{battery-powered}} {{machines that}} are eleven times more energy-efficient {{than the average}} American car. Operating on two lithium-ion batteries, the Segway PT produces zero emissions during operation, and utilizes a negligible amount of electricity while charging via a standard <b>wall</b> <b>outlet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{completely}} {{flat wall}} socket (pictured) 50×50 millimetres (about 2×2 inches) with the 3 flat {{holes in the}} middle. This design matches the look, junction boxes etc. of other Danish <b>wall</b> <b>outlets</b> (such as those for AC power). [...] It supersedes an earlier round model which had a slightly recessed circular depression where the plug goes. Sockets etc. based on this 50mm module may be densely packed on walls etc. both vertically and horizontally, so plugs with their cords etc. need to stay within a traditional 43 mm(?) circle around the center to avoid collisions.|$|R
