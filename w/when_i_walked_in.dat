It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E

The deadly frost which had held us for long weeks in its grip had gone, for it was now drawing to the end of March, but winter was still in the air and in the earth. Day after day a dull cloud was over all the sky and the wind blew cold from the north-east. The aspect of the country, as far as one could see in that level plain, was wintry and colourless. The hedges in that part are kept cut and trimmed so closely that they seemed less like hedges than mere faint greyish fences of brushwood, {{dividing}} field from field: they would not have afforded shelter to a hedge-sparrow. The trees were few and far apart--grey naked oaks, un-visited even by the tits that find their food in bark and twig; the wide fields between were bare and devoid of life of man or beast or bird. Ploughed and grass lands were equally desolate; for the grass was last year's, long dead and now of that neutral, faded, and palest of all pale dead colours in nature. It is not white nor yellow, and there is no name for it. Looking down <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the fields the young spring grass could be seen thrusting up its blades among the old and dead, but at a distance of a few yards these delicate living green threads were invisible.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} with Rima {{in the forest}} under the mora tree had proved so delightful that I was eager for more rambles and talks with her, but the variable little witch had a great surprise in store for me. All her wild natural gaiety had unaccountably gone out of her: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the shade she was there, but no longer as the blithe, fantastic being, bright as an angel, innocent and affectionate as a child, tricksy as a monkey, that had played at hide-and-seek with me. She was now my shy, silent attendant, only occasionally visible, and appearing then like the mysterious maid I had found reclining among the ferns who had melted away mist-like from sight as I gazed. When I called she would not now answer as formerly, but in response would appear in sight as if to assure me that I had not been forsaken; {{and after a few}} moments her grey shadowy form would once more vanish among the trees. The hope that as her confidence increased and she grew accustomed to talk with me she would be brought to reveal the story of her life had to be abandoned, at all events for the present. I must, after all, get my information from Nuflo, or rest in ignorance. The old man was out for the greater part of each day with his dogs, and from these expeditions he brought back nothing that I could see but a few nuts and fruits, some thin bark for his cigarettes, and an occasional handful of haima gum to perfume the hut of an evening. After I had wasted three days in vainly trying to overcome the girl's now inexplicable shyness, I resolved to give for a while my undivided attention to her grandfather to discover, if possible, where he went and how he spent his time.|$|E
40|$|Long {{long time}} ago, {{there was an}} old Bamboo Cutter man called Taketori-no-Okina. He cut bamboos from forests and used it for many {{different}} daily tools. ” This is the first sentence from “Princess Kaguya”, Taketori-Monogatarior Kaguya-hime in Japanese. This is the tale of the Bamboo Cutter that was written in 9 th or 10 th century Japanese folktale. It is considered the oldest existing Japanese narrative. The story is about the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya-hime, who was discovered as a baby inside a glowing bamboo plant by Taketori-no-Okina. According to the first sentence of this tale there is a very close relationship between human life and bamboo in Japan. TAKE, bamboo is one of the typical trees in Asia. I grew up in the countryside in Japan and my house was located just in front of a bamboo forest. I also have some experiences of using bamboos the same as in the tale, “Princess Kaguya”. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the bamboo forest, I have a very special feeling that is intricately related to my childhood background.

For <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> my fields <b>I</b> can see, down Berwick way, the little fluffs of white smoke which tell me of this strange new hundred-legged beast, with coals for food and a thousand men in its belly, for ever crawling over the border.

Such a sight as that would have struck my good old father speechless with wrath as well as surprise; for he was so stricken with the fear of offending the Creator that he was chary of contradicting Nature, and always held the new thing to be nearly akin to the blasphemous.

"Friend Bent hated war so heartily that {{he would}} {{have nothing to do with}} paroles, exchanges, or any martial process whatever, but bade me go when and where I liked, remembering to do by others as I had been done by.

You can imagine what both contained; and so I found myself penniless, but not poor, an outcast, but not alone. Old Bent treated me like a prodigal son, and put money in my purse; his pretty daughters loved me for Margaret's sake, and gave me a patriotic salute all round when I left them, the humblest, happiest man in Pennsylvania. Margaret once said to me that this was the time for deeds, not words; that no man should stand idle, but serve the good cause with head, heart, and hand, no matter in what rank; for in her eyes a private fighting for liberty was nobler than a dozen generals defending slavery.

40|$|In the end {{phases of}} an urban design course that was {{oriented}} towards children, it dawned on me: the shocking realization {{that we are talking}} about play as something that is only significant for children. How could it be that we are talking about playgrounds that adults have no business in. Not that children don’t require specific attention, seeing that they are the future of our world, but what I experienced was quite the epiphany. I started wondering why playfulness isn’t discussed in our studies as a quality? Why isn’t play an important activity of adult life? Personally, all I do in my free time is play. I do all the things I don’t like doing for the sake of play. I play board games, computer games, football. I am exremely playful <b>when</b> <b>I</b> hang out with my friends as I joke around and talk about unserious matters. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the city <b>I</b> play with it. <b>I</b> do not <b>walk</b> for health reasons, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> because <b>I</b> like walking for walking’s sake. I watch people for watching’s sake and I have coffee {{for the sake of a}} nice conversation. Such a big part of our lives deserves some attention, I thought. I started looking into urban design studies and found almost none that brought up play. As I was reading more, cities started looking alarmingly similar and serious. Public spaces, the areas in our cities that have the potential to be the adult playgrounds, began to feel more and more deserted. Slowly, I got increasingly convinced that play as a subject was worth studying. However, it quickly seemed like a difficult angle to approach public space design. Its definition was tricky and people I talked to associated it with children at the first chance. Regardless, in hopes of gaining a fresh perspective, something I felt the field of urban design sorely needed, I foolishly pushed onwards. The result is a short introduction to playful urban design – a merger between playtheory and urban studies...|$|R

All the sweet secrets therein hid By Fancy, ghastly spells undid.

But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> everyone stopped talking. The place was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It was just as quiet as a death chamber. I knew something must be wrong.... Everyone acted as though I might pull out a machine gun and turn it on them at any minute. As soon as I stepped outside, the talking started again...." ...|$|E
60|$|I had a {{great deal}} of work to do, and had many anxieties, but the same {{considerations}} made me keep them to myself. I am far from sure, now, that it was right to do this, but I did it for my child-wife's sake. I search my breast, and I commit its secrets, if I know them, without any reservation to this paper. The old unhappy loss or want of something had, I am conscious, some place in my heart; but not to the embitterment of my life. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> alone <b>in</b> the fine weather, and thought of the summer days when all the air had been filled with my boyish enchantment, I did miss something of the realization of my dreams; but I thought it was a softened glory of the Past, which nothing could have thrown upon the present time. I did feel, sometimes, for a little while, that I could have wished my wife had been my counsellor; had had more character and purpose, to sustain me and improve me by; had been endowed with power to fill up the void which somewhere seemed to be about me; but I felt as if this were an unearthly consummation of my happiness, that never had been meant to be, and never could have been.|$|R

'I stood on the iron bars; the restless waters toiled and struggled beneath my feet as I {{looked up into the}} place of darkness. A voice called to me, [...] "Get light, and behold me from above! Get light! get light!" [...] Sun, and moon, and stars gave no light there! but lamps burnt in the city, in the houses of the dead, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> by them <b>in</b> the night-time; and the lamp gave light when sun, and moon, and stars gave none! From the top steps I looked down, and saw the Powerful One in his golden brightness; and approached not, but watched and listened in fear. The voice again!--the voice was heard again!--"Sacrifice to me in secret, as thy brethren sacrifice! Give me the living where the living are, and the dead where the dead!" [...] The air came up cold, and the voice ceased, and the lamp was like sun, and moon, and stars--it gave no light in the place of darkness!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> late <b>I</b> <b>walked,</b> <b>in</b> earlier days, All {{was stiff}} and stark; Knee-deep snows choked all the ways, In the sky no spark; Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods, Struggling through the drifted roads; The whited desert knew me not, Snow-ridges masked each darling spot; The summer dells, by genius haunted, One arctic moon had disenchanted. All the sweet secrets therein hid By Fancy, ghastly spells undid. Eldest mason, Frost, had piled Swift cathedrals in the wild; The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts In the star-lit minster aisled. I found no joy: the icy wind Might rule {{the forest to}} his mind. Who would freeze on frozen lakes? Back to books and {{sheltered}} home, And wood-fire flickering on the walls, To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games, Without the baffled North-wind calls. But soft! a sultry morning breaks; The ground-pines wash their rusty green, The maple-tops their crimson tint, On the soft path each track is seen, The girl's foot leaves its neater print. The pebble loosened from the frost Asks of the urchin to be tost. In flint and marble beats a heart, The kind Earth takes her children's part, The green lane is the school-boy's friend, Low leaves his quarrel apprehend, The fresh ground loves his top and ball, The air rings jocund to his call, The brimming brook invites a leap, He dives the hollow, climbs the steep. The youth sees omens where he goes, And speaks all languages the rose, The wood-fly mocks with tiny voice The far halloo of human voice; The perfumed berry on the spray Smacks of faint memories far away. A subtle chain of countless rings The next into the farthest brings, And, striving to be man, the worm Mounts through all the spires of form.|$|R
