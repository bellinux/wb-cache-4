50|$|However, many of {{the early}} frames were {{converted}} to accept sloping throatplate boilers, as listed below. This modification was carried out to provide a stock of spare boilers for the early engines, which would minimise the time spent in works by engines awaiting a fresh boiler. All locomotives from no. 5225 were fitted when new with the sloping throatplate boiler. All extra boilers made had the sloping throatplate arrangement, and only {{one example of a}} later engine having been fitted with a straight throatplate boiler is known - no. 45433. Several different patterns of boiler were used on the locomotives, running into double figures. The throatplate design was the most significant, but there were also different numbers of superheater flues, firegrate arrangement, stay material, dome and water feed arrangements, <b>washout</b> <b>plug</b> placement, etc. in various combinations.|$|E
2500|$|SCOA-P wheels were {{developed}} in the late 1940s by the Steel Company of Australia Ltd (the P in the acronym standing for F. C. Paynter, who patented the design) in response to Victorian Railways experiencing fatigue problems with conventional spoked wheels. Stronger Boxpok type 'B' wheels had been installed {{on a number of}} VR locomotive classes in the late 1940s, but they had the disadvantage of being relatively heavy and also restricted maintenance access to axleboxes, underslung springs, and in some cases boiler <b>washout</b> <b>plugs.</b> Boxpok wheels were proposed for the forthcoming Victorian Railways R class 4-6-4, which had a relatively heavy [...] axle load, but it had been discovered that the use of a Boxpok wheel would make coupling rod pin removal difficult. The SCOA-P wheel was developed to allow the strength of the Boxpok design but also provide the maintenance access of a conventional spoked wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The metal {{walls of}} the firebox are {{normally}} called sheets, which are separated and supported by stays. The stays support and brace the [...] "sheets" [...] (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located {{at right angles to}} the sheets, but since the outer sheet (wrapper sheet) is radial and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each, other must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The fusible plugs, usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with fusible plugs. Also, fusible plugs should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The [...] "mudholes," [...] or <b>washout</b> <b>plugs,</b> allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale.|$|R
40|$|Data from a medium-scale {{horizontal}} {{flow loop}} test facility {{is used to}} test fault diagnosis in managed pressure drilling. The faults are downhole incidents such as formation influx, fluid loss, drillstring <b>washout,</b> pack-off, and <b>plugging</b> of the drill bit, which are important to detect and handle {{in order to avoid}} downtime and possibly dangerous situations. In this paper a fault diagnosis scheme based on an adaptive observer and the generalized likelihood ratio test is applied on the experimental data. The different types of faults are detected and their location are isolated using friction parameter estimates. Results indicate that the method can in most cases identify the type of fault, whereas the location is sometimes more uncertain...|$|R
