Poseban je naglasak stavljen na prikaz mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja školjkaša u bočatim vodama ušća. U ušću rijeke Krke utvrđeno je 56 svojti iz 27 porodica. Najrasprostranjenije su ove svojte: dagnja (Mytilus galloprovincialis), kamenica (Ostrea edulis), a česte su: jestiva srčanka (Cerastoderma glaucum), prnjavica (Venus verrucosa), kućica (Tapes decussatus), kunjka (Arca noae), mala kapica (Chlamys varia) i jakovska kapica (Pecten jacobaeus). Izlov prirodnih populacija školjkaša za prehranu tradicionalna je djelatnost i procjenjuje se na 100 tona u godini. Istraživanja mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja dagnje, kamenice, male kapice i jakovske kapice rezultirala su razvojem tehnologija konroliranog uzgoja dagnje i kamenice 1983., a jakovske kapice i male kapice godine 1989. Danas je proizvodnja organizirana na 25 lokaliteta, ukupne površine 87. 142 m 2, s mogućnošću proizvodnje oko 1. 500 tona dagnji i deset tisuća kamenica, a mogla bi se povećati iznad 10. 000 tona. Krka River {{spring is}} {{at the foot of}} Dinara mountain, {{starting}} from a 22 m high Topoljski waterfall. Its length is 72. 5 km, and total slope 242 m. The length of freshwater waterway is 49 km and brackish waterway, i. e. flooded river mouth, 23. 5 km long. Impact of seawater and depth of surface fresh water greatly vary depending on the river waterlevel, local precipitation, tides and wind directions. Owing to the extensive primary production in the river mouth shellfish are abundantly present with 56 species. The most abundant are Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprouincialis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), and partly common cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), <b>Venus</b> <b>shell</b> (<b>Venus</b> verucosa), calico clam (Tapes decussates), Noah 2 ̆ 7 s arc (Arca noae), variegated scallop (Chlamis uaria) and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus). Owing to very productive processes in the ecosystem of river mouth, fishing in the area is traditionally practice. The knowledge about natural populations of Mediterranean mussel fished out in quantities larger than 100 t/y have initiated the research on since 1979 shellfish in this area. Investigations on possibilities of commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel, flat oyster, variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) resulted in defining the technological procedure for commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel and flat oyster (1983), and variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (1989). Nowadays at 25 localities of 87. 000 m 2 area and with 19 concessions a total production around 1500 t/y of Mediterranean mussel and about 10. 000 pieces of flat oyster is provided, and there is also significant possibility to increase production up to 10. 000 tons...|$|R

60|$|Madam Chiffinch {{accordingly}} {{mingled with}} the flotilla which attended the King on his voyage down the Thames, amongst whom was the Queen, attended {{by some of the}} principal ladies of the Court. The little plump Cleopatra, dressed to as much advantage as her taste could devise, and seated upon her embroidered cushions like <b>Venus</b> in her <b>shell,</b> neglected nothing that effrontery and minauderie could perform to draw upon herself some portion of the King's observation; but Charles was not in the vein, and did not even pay her the slightest passing attention of any kind, until her boatmen having ventured to approach nearer to the Queen's barge than etiquette permitted, received a peremptory order to back their oars, and fall out of the royal procession. Madam Chiffinch cried for spite, and transgressed Solomon's warning, by cursing the King in her heart; but had no better course than to return to Westminster, and direct Chaubert's preparations for the evening.|$|R
50|$|June and Randy {{are aware}} of Mallick's illegal fishing, and attempt to hunt him down together. At one point, Randy boards Mallick's boat in search of evidence, but Mallick and Carlo knock him {{unconscious}} into the sea. June rescues him and drags him to shore. It is gradually revealed that Randy is unhappy with Cynthia, and he {{falls in love with}} June instead. Diana discovers that Venus is forced to work at the cafe because Earl Barker the owner, has taken her pearl tiara: her birthright; an object of magic that gives anyone who holds it power over the owner. Diana forces Earl to give up the tiara and also finds a large seashell, the birthright of another mermaid. Venus realizes that it belongs to Earl's middle-aged wife Betty; who has forgotten her mermaid heritage. <b>Venus</b> returns the <b>shell,</b> but Betty decides to stay on land because she has a human daughter.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of Wisconsin, Superior, 2011. 30 leaves. This thesis {{includes}} {{reading the}} chosen artworks {{as a visual}} interpretation of the written mythological birth of Venus by the sea. Reading the selected painting as visual novels, the pictorial symbolism helps prove or disprove the true theme of the Venus. The writer bases her theory on the inclusion of mythological symbols that represent the <b>Venus</b> Anadyomene; scallop <b>shell,</b> dolphins, Aros, dove, sparrow, girdle, mirror, myrtle, and roses. The comparison of various artists' interpretations of this theme and the symbols they use to recognize the Venus as such is {{a substantial part of}} the research. The writer concludes in this thesis that the chosen art pieces are or are not a Venus Anadyomene, and in fact just a female nude entitled and themed fallaciously for an allure or ambiance. Through extensive research in the mythological symbolism of the Goddess of Love, the above-mentioned symbols used by various artists across several eras prove the Venus a true character of mythological history...|$|R
