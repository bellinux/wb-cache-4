2500|$|The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics conducts {{biannual}} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) {{to assess}} the health and nutritional status of adults {{and children in the}} United States. Some results are reported as <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Eat</b> In America. The 2013-2014 survey reported that for adults ages 20 years and older, men consumed on average 83.3 mg/d and women 75.1 mg/d. This means that half the women and more than half the men are not consuming the RDA for vitamin C. The same survey stated that about 30% of adults reported they consumed a vitamin C dietary supplement or a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin C, and that for these people total consumption was between 300 and 400 mg/d.|$|E

Ingrid Newkirk wrote of Animal Liberation, [...] "It forever changed the {{conversation}} about our treatment of animals. It made people—myself included—change <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ate,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wore, and how we perceived animals." [...] Others who claim that their attitudes to animals changed after reading the book include Peter Tatchell and Matt Ball.|$|R

He supposed he was <b>eating</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ate,</b> and therefore did not like to say anything about it.' ...|$|R

However, if you can't eat <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>eat,</b> don't eat anything. We shall not be offended, and the banquet will be just as merry and delightful." ...|$|E

In the first place, we are so pleased at going that we don't care a bit <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>eat,</b> {{and in the second}} place we had breakfast on board the boat, and we were both so hungry that I am sure we could go till supper time without eating if necessary." ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{equilibrium}} {{to be established}} is fourfold. There must be a true equilibrium between <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> and what we reject again by excretion: likewise between the systole and diastole of the heart, the inspiration and expiration of our breathing. Suffice to say {{the equilibrium}} is never quite perfect. Most people are either too fat or too thin, too hot or too cold, too slow or too quick. There {{is no such thing}} as an actual norm, a living norm. A norm is merely an abstraction, not a reality.|$|E

'Good,' {{said the}} Foal; 'and now thou {{must take the}} sword away with thee, and with it shalt thou cut off the heads of all seven of us on thy wedding-day, and then we shall become princes again as we were before. For we are {{brothers}} of the Princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the King <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> and drink, {{but there is a}} mighty Troll who has cast a spell over us. When thou hast cut off our heads, thou must take the greatest care to lay each head at the tail of the body to which it belonged before, and then the spell which the Troll has cast upon us will lose all its power.' ...|$|E

From this time I banish dreams, visions, imaginings, and will no more of them. I {{am going to be}} myself--my genuine self, my honest self, my natural self, clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud, and worthy of you. There is no grain of social {{inequality}} between us; I, like you, am poor; I, like you, am without position or distinction; you are a struggling artist, I am that, too, in my humbler way. Our bread is honest bread, we work for our living. Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave, helping each other in all ways, living for each other, being and remaining one in heart and purpose, one in hope and aspiration, inseparable to the end. And though our place is low, judged by the world's eye, we will make it as high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> and wear, and conduct above reproach. We live in a land, let us be thankful, where this is all-sufficient, and no man is better than his neighbor by the grace of God, but only by his own merit." ...|$|E

40|$|Recommendations about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should <b>eat</b> and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{should not}} <b>eat</b> {{to keep us}} healthy seem to change daily in the media. Over history, trends in diets have also changed but the general {{recommendations}} for healthy living have remained relatively constant. A ‘balanced’ diet of the main constituents (proteins, carbohydrates, dairy produce and fruit and vegetables) has survived the test of time. There have been attempts to establish exactly what proportions of the diet should be filled with particular foodstuffs and how they should be eaten throughout history. Early scholars recommended that food should balance the four humours and therefore maintain the equilibrium {{of the body and}} this was dependent on individual temperaments (Wright, 2010) ...|$|R

500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ate,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea.

With approximately 40, 000 menus dating from the 1840 s to the present, NYPL’s collection {{is one of the}} largest of its kind in the world, used by historians, novelists, food writers, and general food enthusiasts. These menus are cultural artifacts and ephemera beyond simple descriptions of food; they provide insights on matters as diverse as politics, neighborhood development, and the evolution of graphic design. The planned menus database, which will store keyword-searchable structured information like restaurant location, dish-level descriptions, and food prices, will enable researchers, authors, culinary and other historians to track ingredients, dishes, prices, fads, and food vernacular through history, opening up new possibilities for discovering who <b>we</b> were through <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>ate...</b>|$|R

40|$|A pair of {{recently}} published studies demonstrate that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{happen to be}} listening to can sometimes change our perception (or, at the very least, our rating) of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are <b>eating</b> or drinking.
