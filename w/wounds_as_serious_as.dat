The U.S. Attorney said that the defendant had been moved into federal custody in Manhattan. Rahimi's lawyer, David Patton, questioned if his client would get proper medical treatment at the new location. He explained that Rahimi had eight to ten surgeries, {{and that one of}} Rahimi's hands had not adequately healed. Also, he continued to suffer from an open <b>wound</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> liver damage. Federal authorities argued that Rahimi was well enough to be in regular custody.|$|R
50|$|Mironov was violently {{attacked}} {{in his home}} on 3 June 2003 by {{a former member of}} the Russian police forces. The attack left him unconscious, with four open <b>wounds</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> brain damage, which prevented him from returning to work. On 5 June 2003, two days after the attack, Mironov went to a police station to report what had happened, in order to make sure the offence did not go unpunished and to obtain compensation for the serious harm suffered. In September, Mironov discovered that the police had refused to register his complaint and had decided to clear the person responsible for the attack. In order to denounce this serious failing on the part of the authorities, Viacheslav Igrunov, a member of the Duma at the time, wrote to the Public Prosecutor of Moscow, the Public Prosecutor of the district responsible for the inquiry, and the Chief of Police of Moscow. For its part, the 'Frontline Defenders' human rights association referred the Mironov affair to the Attorney General of Russia. On 6 January 2004, the Russian judicial authorities decided not to pursue the criminal inquiry on the basis of a police report stating that the injuries suffered by Mironov were very slight, despite all the medical files produced by Mironov proving that the injuries were serious. The acts of intimidation against Mironov continued until he was admitted to a neurological clinic in Germany on 11 January 2004. With medical help provided in Europe, Mironov gradually returned to health and resumed his work as a human rights activist, reporter and fixer.|$|R
