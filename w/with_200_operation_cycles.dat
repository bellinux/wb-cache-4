The research aimed {{to find out}} the condition of <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cycle to cigarette corporation and food and beverage corporation which has faster <b>operation</b> and cash <b>cycles.</b> Hypothesis used in the research was whether any different between <b>operation</b> and cash <b>cycles</b> between cigarette corporation and food and beverage sector and between cigarette sector and food and beverage sector, the faster cycles was cigarette sector. Data analysis technique used was <b>operation</b> equation <b>cycle</b> and cash cycle, the calculation of <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cycle, time series method, bivariate analysis. <b>Operation</b> <b>cycle</b> was get from the stock in days added with credit in day, while cash cylce from <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> substract with daily payment. The <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> average was found by sum the <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> in 5 years, divide with 5 periods; there also cash cycle. The next phase, calculate with time series method found from comparison of <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> or cash cycle in a corporation from year to year. Testing tool used for the first hypothesis was bivariate analysis with chi-square test, to test the different and measure the relation between two variables, while the second hypothesis, should be compared the average <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cycles between cigarette corporation with food and beverage corporation The result showed that there were differences between <b>operation</b> and cash <b>cycle</b> between cigarette corporation and food and beverage corporation where PT Aqua Golden Mississippi Tbk in 2002 had the fastest <b>operation</b> and cash <b>cycle</b> for 23, 92 days and 3, 47 days. Average calculation of <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cycle in 5 years showed that the fastest <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> was PT Aqua Golden Mississippi Tbk with average 44, 59 days, since the company has small stock, so that there were no passive stock and the payment was done in cash, so that could minimize the operational cost, while the fastest cash cycle was PT. Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk with average 34, 23 days, since the faster credit distribution and slow debt payment so that the corporation could process the existed fund. Time series method showed that in 2002 - 2003 PT HM. Sampoerna Tbk had faster <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk had faster cash cycle. The research showed that corporation management should process the <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cycle in optimal way. For investor of cigarette sector investment with food and beverage corporation, they should see the ability of organization ability in processing <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and cash cylcle for maximum profit...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} fuel efficiency of tractor using working <b>cycle.</b> First, baler <b>operation</b> was conducted in Italian ryegrass farmlands and engine torque and fuel consumption were measured as field data. Second, baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> was developed using the field data. The arbitrary working cycles were generated by randomly selected micro–trips, minimum working patterns. Some of the arbitrary working cycles were selected and baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> was determined considering sum of squared difference (SSD). The baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> was evaluated using performance value (PV) comparing with driving cycles. The results showed that PVs of the driving cycles were 67 ～ 109 % of the baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle.</b> Third, fuel efficiency of the baler operation was evaluated by dynamometer test using dynamometer system and the baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle.</b> The fuel consumption and engine power were measured while the engine acted on the baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> and fuel efficiency was evaluated. The results of t–test showed no significant difference between fuel efficiency by the dynamometer test and fuel efficiency of each farmland by the field test. Considering all results of this study, the baler <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> is feasible to apply to evaluate fuel efficiency of tractor with dynamometer system...|$|R

40|$|For low-volume tumours, high {{surgical}} hospital {{volume is}} associated with better survival. For high-volume tumours like breast cancer, this association is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine to what extent the yearly surgical hospital breast cancer volume {{is associated with}} overall survival. All patients, diagnosed with primary invasive non-metastatic breast cancer in the period 2001 – 2005, were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Hospitals were grouped by their annual volume of surgery for invasive breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used including patient and tumour characteristics as covariates. Follow-up was completed until the 1 st of February 2013. Primary endpoint was 10 -year overall survival rate. In total, 58, 982 patients with invasive non-metastatic breast cancer were diagnosed during the period 2001 – 2005. Hospitals were grouped by their (mean) annual surgical volume: < 75 (n = 19), 75 – 99 (n = 30), 100 – 149 (n = 29), 150 – 199 (n = 9) and ≥ 200 (n = 14). The 10 -year observed survival rates were 77, 81, 80, 82 and 82 %, respectively. After case-mix adjustment, patients in low-volume hospitals had a HR of 1. 09 (< 75 vs. ≥ 200; 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 15). Survival was significantly higher for lobular carcinoma and for diagnosis in the most recent year (2005). Being a male, having a higher age at diagnosis, a higher tumour grade, a larger tumour size, a higher number of positive lymph nodes, an earlier year of diagnosis and a lower SES resulted in a reduced survival and influenced death, all to a larger extent than surgical volume did. In the Netherlands, surgical hospital volume influences 10 -year overall survival only marginally and far less than patient and tumour characteristics. No difference in survival was revealed for invasive non-metastatic breast cancer patients in hospitals with 75 – 99 operations per year compared with hospitals <b>with</b> over <b>200</b> <b>operations</b> per yea...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, a new {{generation}} of power grid system, referred to as the Smart Grid, with an aim of managing electricity demand in a sustainable, reliable, and economical manner has emerged. With greater knowledge of operational characteristics of individual appliances, necessary automation control strategies can be developed in the Smart Grid to operate appliances in an efficient manner. This paper provides a way of classifying different operational cycles of a household appliance by introducing an unsupervised learning algorithm called k-means clustering. An intrinsic method known as silhouette coefficient was used to measure the classification quality. An identification process is also discussed in this paper to help users identify the operation mode each types of <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> stands for. A case study using a typical household refrigerator is presented to validate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed the classification and identification method can partition and identify different <b>operation</b> <b>cycles</b> adequately. Classification of <b>operation</b> <b>cycles</b> for such appliances is beneficial for Smart Grid as it provides a clear and convincing understanding of the operation modes for effective power management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{focuses on}} the MW {{contingency}} selection problem. It is assumed a real time operation environment. A multilevel prefilter is proposed, so as to discard the contingencies that are certainly harmless to the system operation {{from the standpoint of}} MW power overflows. The prefilter is also adaptive, since information from one <b>operation</b> <b>cycle</b> can be used in the next <b>operation</b> <b>cycle,</b> provided that the change in the system operating conditions is small, which is often the case. Simulation results show that the proposed prefilter is accurate and results in significant computational time savings.
