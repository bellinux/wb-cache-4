5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} made from raw sugar that has {{undergone}} a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} {{granulated}} sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} her {{movements}} and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> at Java {{and headed for the}} United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was diverted from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused to pay for it, believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce, 276 U.S. 469 (1928). The court found that under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or not}} the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{patterns}} ofsupply {{and demand}} for sugars have changed over the last fifteen years, {{particularly with regard to}} demand. The market for <b>white</b> <b>sugars</b> has increased in the developing nations, while the raw sugarmarket has shifted emphasis from the U. S. A. to the sugar-producing countries. Current and future production systems for raw and refined sugars are considered in light of these changes.

25|$|White refined is {{the most}} common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by {{dissolving}} and purifying raw sugar using phosphoric acid similar to the method used for blanco directo, a carbonatation process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies.

Beet sugar refineries produce refined <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> directly without an intermediate raw stage.|$|E

500|$|Sugar beet {{became a}} major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a {{biennial}} plant, a cultivated variety of Beta vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in a clamp in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant. Here the crop is washed and sliced and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the raw juice [...] and carbonatated in a number of stages in order to purify it. Water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum. The syrup is then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> that crystallizes out can be separated in a centrifuge and dried. It requires no further refining.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of different types of <b>sugar</b> (<b>white</b> refined <b>sugar,</b> <b>white</b> crystal <b>sugar,</b> demerara sugar, brown sugar and coconut sugar) on the physicochemical characteristics, rheological properties and sensory acceptance of physalis (Physalis L) jelly. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the information on the acceptability of the product. It was found that the type of sugar greatly influences the physicochemical and rheological characteristics of physalis jelly which reflects differences in the product acceptability. Due to higher sensory acceptance, white refined, white crystal and demerara sugars are the most suitable for processing jellies. It was also found that the sugar type information and its benefits has no significant influence on sensory acceptance of physalis jelly and that consumers have a preference for a clearer, less sweet, more acidic and softer jelly...|$|R
2500|$|Caster (or castor) (0.35mm), a {{very fine}} sugar in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, so-named because the grains are {{small enough to fit}} through a castor which is small vessel with a {{perforated}} top, from which to sprinkle sugar at table. Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as [...] "superfine" [...] sugar in the United States. Because of its fineness, it dissolves more quickly than regular <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> and is thus especially useful in meringues and cold liquids. Castor sugar can be prepared at home by grinding granulated sugar {{for a couple of minutes}} in a mortar or food processor.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} widely-traded {{commodities}} in the world throughout history, sugar accounts for around 2% of the global dry cargo market. International sugar prices show great volatility, ranging from around 3 to over 60 cents [...] per pound in the [...] 50 years. About 100 of the world's 180 countries produce sugar from beet or cane, a few more refine raw sugar to produce <b>white</b> <b>sugar,</b> and all countries consume sugar. Consumption of sugar ranges from around 3 kilograms per person per annum in Ethiopia to around 40kg/person/yr in Belgium. Consumption per capita rises with income per capita until it reaches a plateau of around 35kg per person per year in middle income countries.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{sugarcane}} processing requires two stages. Mills extract {{raw sugar}} from freshly harvested cane and [...] "mill-white” sugar is sometimes produced {{immediately after the}} first stage at sugar-extraction mills, intended for local consumption. Sugar crystals appear naturally white in color during the crystallization process. Sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules {{as well as to}} stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation. Refineries, often located nearer to consumers in North America, Europe, and Japan, then produce refined <b>white</b> <b>sugar,</b> which is 99 percent sucrose. These two stages are slowly merging. Increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products, driving a trend toward combined milling and refining.|$|E
