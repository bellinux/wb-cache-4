In the foothills of four different areas, a total of 185 <b>wild</b> <b>rodents</b> (all Apodemus speciosus, except for 3 individuals of A. argenteus) were captured alive between October 1984 and October 1985.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} three aspects of Trypanosoma cruzi {{transmission}} dynamics. The first project examines {{the prevalence of}} T. cruzi and the non-pathogenic trypanosome T. rangeli in pack rats in peri-urban areas of Tucson, Arizona. As a continuation of this study, we conducted a similar survey in Mariano Melgar, a district in the endemic region of Arequipa, Peru. These projects focus {{on the importance of}} the rodent reservoir both in endemic and nonendemic areas for human Chagas disease, and hypothesize that <b>wild</b> <b>rodent</b> populations may be contributing to continued disease transmission. The final study examines the potential for oral transmission of T. cruzi and focuses on the guinea pig as a reservoir host. Combined, these studies provide a holistic understanding of the rodent reservoir host. Understanding the transmission dynamics in both <b>wild</b> <b>rodent</b> and guinea pig populations can help us to better determine the role they play in human Chagas Disease transmission. Such research will provide insight for future intervention studies. The infectivity study in guinea pigs will also provide valuable information for potential modes of transmission in reservoir species. These studies will also provide a comparative analysis of different transmission cycles. By examining these cycles we can better understand the ecology of T. cruzi and its reservoir hosts...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the reservoir hosts of cowpox virus are <b>wild</b> <b>rodents,</b> although direct {{evidence for this}} is lacking {{for much of the}} virus's geographic range.

This {{is one of the few}} empirical studies on host-parasite ecology from a relatively under-studied geographic region (Southeast Asia), where warm and wet climates year-round may allow ectoparasites with free-living stages to breed more frequently and persist at high densities (Takahashi et al.

40|$|To clarify how Borrelia miyamotoi is {{maintained}} {{in the environment}} in Hokkaido, we examined Ixodes persulcatus for its prevalence among <b>wild</b> <b>rodents</b> and its tick vector by detecting {{a portion of the}} borrelial flaB gene in rodent urinary bladder and blood samples, and from whole ticks. We compared B. miyamotoi infection rates to Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii, which are human Lyme disease pathogens also carried by <b>wild</b> <b>rodents,</b> and which are transmitted by the same vector tick. Whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii showed age dependence of infection rates among <b>wild</b> <b>rodents</b> (18. 4 % and 9. 9 % among adults and 6. 0 % and 3. 4 % among sub-adults, respectively) when looking at urinary bladder samples, B. miyamotoi infection rates were not age dependent for either blood (4. 2 % among adults, and 7. 9 % among sub-adults) or urinary bladder samples (1. 0 % among adults, and 1. 7 % among sub-adults). Moreover, while B. garinii and B. afzelii infection rates showed increases across months (June, July [p < 0. 05] and August [p < 0. 01] had higher rates than in May for adult rodents with B. garinii, and July and August had higher rates than in May [p < 0. 01] for adult rodents with B. afzelii), B. miyamotoi infection rates did not show significant month dependence.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to observe the effects of {{long-term}} exposure of environmental pollutants during human life. For this purpose, we measured the basal levels of heavy metals in the tissue of the organs of <b>wild</b> <b>rodents.</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>rodents</b> were caught in six localities within Higashi-osaka city in the suburbs of Osaka, Japan, and the Cr, Cd and Pb content in the organs of the rodents were compared. In addition, isotope ratios of Pb were measured. No detectable Hg was measured by ICP-MS in the liver, kidney, lung, and brain of the <b>wild</b> <b>rodents.</b> When the metal contents of the organs were compared, the contents of Cr, Cd, and Pb in the kidney were higher than in the liver and brain. The lung Cr content was similar to the kidney; however, no Pb content was detected in the lungs in any rodents. Also, lung Cd content was lower than in the kidney. When metal content in the rodent organs was compared with the collection locality, only Cd content in the brain was observed as different. Next, when the 207 / 206 ratio of Pb was compared with the organs and collection locality, the ratios were different between the brain and kidney, and between the brain and liver. The ratio of Pb in the brain was a significant difference between No 1 and No 4 localities. In conclusion, metals may be absorbed into organs by different absorption routes. The spread of heavy metal environmental pollution is well reflected in the organs of <b>wild</b> <b>rodents</b> living in the suburbs of Osaka, Japan...|$|R
