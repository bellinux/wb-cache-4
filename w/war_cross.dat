5|$|Sélestat became French {{again after}} the First World War, during which almost a {{thousand}} inhabitants died. It {{was part of the}} Third Reich during the Second World War. Its liberation took three months and ended in February 1945. The town is a recipient of the <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> 1914–1918 and <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> 1939–1945. Sélestat has experienced steady demographic and economic growth since 1945. Its population almost doubled between 1946 and 1999 and two industrial parks were built to accommodate new large factories. The service industry has enriched the town's economy since the 1970s with a large number of small businesses.|$|E

50|$|The {{ribbon of}} the <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> was in red-white-black-white-red; that was, {{the red and}} black colors being {{reversed}} from the ribbon of the World War II version of the Iron Cross. The ribbon for the War Merit Medal was similar, but with a narrow red vertical red strip {{in the center of}} the black field. Soldiers who earned the <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> 2nd Class with Swords wore a small crossed-swords device on the ribbon. The <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> 1st Class was a pin-backed medal worn on the pocket of the tunic (like the Iron Cross 1st Class). The ribbon of the <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> 2nd Class could be worn like the ribbon of the Iron Cross 2nd Class (through the second buttonhole). Nonetheless combat soldiers tended to hold the <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> in low regard, referring to its wearers as being in 'Iron Cross Training'. The Knights <b>Cross</b> of the <b>War</b> Merit <b>Cross</b> was a neck order and worn the same way as the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.|$|R

5|$|During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units {{had become}} widely scattered, with forces being {{deployed}} to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey {{would spend the}} rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek <b>War</b> <b>Cross,</b> First Class.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{was back}} in Egypt, Hargest was {{critical}} of Freyberg's conduct of the fighting on Crete in a meeting with General Archibald Wavell, commander of the Allied forces in the Middle East. He expressed similar views in a meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, who was in Egypt at the time on a visit to the New Zealand forces. He also voiced concern over what he considered to be a lack of consultation by Freyberg with his senior commanders. He was able to resolve his differences with Freyberg and in later correspondence with Fraser expressed his satisfaction with the way Freyberg dealt with his subordinates. Hargest's own performance on Crete escaped official scrutiny and he was awarded a bar to his DSO. He was also awarded the Greek <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> for his services in the military campaigns in Greece and Crete.|$|E
5|$|The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens and {{situated on the}} cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England. It is one of fifteen War Crosses {{designed by}} Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two {{to serve as a}} civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.|$|E

5000|$|The {{memorial}} {{stands on}} a small triangular green {{in the middle of}} the village. It is one of Lutyens' fifteen <b>War</b> <b>Crosses,</b> the majority of which stand in small villages across England. Typical of Lutyens' <b>War</b> <b>Crosses,</b> it has a long, tapering shaft with short arms moulded near the top, though it has uncommonly deep bevelled edges and sits on a deep two-tiered stone base, which itself sits on a small stone circle in the grass. The main inscription is on the north face: [...] "PASS FRIEND ALL IS WELL / 1914 HARTBURN 1919"; the inscription [...] "1939 HARTBURN 1945" [...] was added to the south face after the Second World War.|$|R

5|$|The {{committee}} was reliant on public donations and realised {{that it was}} unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the {{committee was}} determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported {{the construction of a}} battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough {{rejoined the}} 6th Infantry Brigade in October 1940 and, {{disappointed}} with its quality, put considerable emphasis on training. This {{meant that it}} generally performed well during the campaign in Greece in April 1941. After {{the conclusion of the}} fighting in Greece, he refused to join in the criticism directed by some senior officers of the 2nd New Zealand Division at Freyberg's leadership during the battle. He later fought in Operation Crusader, the campaign to lift the Siege of Tobruk. At one point in the battle, his brigade captured elements of the headquarters of the Afrika Korps. However, he was impetuous in his efforts to capture Point 175, a strategically important hill to the south of Tobruk, and this led to heavy losses in one of the battalions of his brigade. Although Point 175 was seized, Barrowclough's brigade was only able to hold it for a few days before being forced to withdraw due to German attacks. He received a Bar to his DSO for his leadership during the Crusader offensive, having already been awarded the Greek <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> and a mention in despatches for his work in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to apply pressure, calling another public meeting—which it scheduled for 3 May 1923—forcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between {{the company and the}} city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new location—a <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> and a Stone of Remembrance—which would have cost almost £2,500. The scheme was scaled back to just the cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the £1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.|$|E

5|$|The York City War Memorial is a First World War {{memorial}} {{designed by}} Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York {{in the north}} of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.|$|E

For this purpose, when the Cross of Valour was re-instituted in 1921, the Royal Decree allowed the awardees of the <b>War</b> <b>Cross</b> – which was tainted in the eyes of the royalist government by its Venizelist associations – to petition for its replacement with the new Cross of Valour, but in the event, very few chose to do so.|$|E
