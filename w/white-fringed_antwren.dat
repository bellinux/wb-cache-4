50|$|It has a tu whistle {{followed}} by a trilled churet, and a repeated and accelerating tu-ik call. Southern birds also have a repetitive chump-chump-chump song, quite unlike northern races which are sometimes separated as northern <b>white-fringed</b> <b>antwren</b> (Formicivora intermedia). F. grisea proper would then become the southern <b>white-fringed</b> <b>antwren.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-fringed</b> <b>antwren</b> (Formicivora grisea) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} antbird family. It is {{a resident}} breeder in tropical South America from Colombia southeast to the Guianas and Brazil, and on Tobago.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a common}} and confiding bird of second growth woodland, usually found as {{territorial}} pairs. The southern populations are associated with scrubby bushes on white sandy soils and restinga habitat. These birds inhabit the lowlands, up to around 200 m ASL. In some places, they are sympatric with the rusty-backed antwren (F. rufa). The <b>white-fringed</b> <b>antwren</b> feeds on small insects and other arthropods taken from undergrowth twigs and foliage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-fringed</b> <b>antwren</b> is {{typically}} 12.7 cm long, and weighs 9.4 g. The male has a grey-brown crown and upperparts, and black wings, tail, lower face and underparts. There are two conspicuous white wing bars {{and a white}} stripe running from above the eye {{down the sides of}} the breast and flanks. The tail feathers are tipped with white. The female's upperparts are much like the male, but females of the southern populations are orange below and have an orange supercilium. These occur south and east from southeastern Colombia and southernmost Venezuela. Northern population's females have underparts which are buff with dark streaks. The Tobagonian subspecies F. g. tobagensis is larger than mainland birds.|$|E
