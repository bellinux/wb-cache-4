(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between a more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare accuse the nation of... want of {{perseverance}} in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia....

5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

Because this was a preliminary study, we focused on experimental procedure, medi-ums and data analysis tools to use in researches of this kind.

5|$|We {{all have}} a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask? Our part {{is to find the}} trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were also}} breakthroughs. Marilyn Dubow, a soloist with the symphony, won {{a seat in}} the New York Philharmonic as the first female violinist. Elayne Jones, one of the founders, joined the San Francisco Symphony as its first black woman timpanist. Thinking back on her days with the Symphony of the New World, Jones remembers, [...] "The {{legitimacy}} of our organization was not acceptable until <b>we</b> <b>had</b> people who were supporting us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> donations <b>to</b> begin to establish as a viable organization and to get union support! <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> begin getting players for this orchestra.

It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

In this work, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> study the second law of Newton by taking knowledge of the air friction, the speed of the satellite which helped us to find the equation that relates the trajectory of the satellite itself, its speed and the density of the air depending on the altitude. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find a mathematic relation that links the density with the altitude and then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put it into our movement equation.
