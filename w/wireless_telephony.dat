It {{operated}} {{a variety of}} aircraft, including Airco DH.6, Avro 504K, Avro 504N, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e, Sopwith Camel and Sopwith Snipe. Aircrew attended the school for a one-week-long course in <b>wireless</b> <b>telephony</b> procedures. The school was disbanded on 23 March 1919. Knotley Hall was offered for sale in May 1919. In September 1919, {{it was announced that}} Penshurst had been disposed of by the Royal Air Force, and that it could be considered as an emergency landing ground for civil aircraft.|$|E
25|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) {{services were}} introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of private telegrams by seamen. Implementation was slow: by 1935 HF transmitters had been installed on about 100 Norwegian ships, and 450 ships by 1940. <b>Wireless</b> <b>telephony</b> was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast. In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by wireless transmission. From 1927 new spark-gap transmitters over 300watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940. Implementation of vacuum tube transmitters was slow: by 1937, 600 of 1000 Norwegian ships with a ship radio still had spark-gap transmitters. The coast stations all received vacuum tube transmitters by 1935.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Marconi {{companies}} {{gained a}} reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous-wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, and he spoke of the close association of aviation and <b>wireless</b> <b>telephony</b> in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.|$|E

40|$|Future mobile {{wireless}} Internet {{will need}} to support flexible interactive services such as <b>wireless</b> Internet <b>telephony</b> and other streaming services like delivery of multimedia content over wireless net-works. This thesis proposal focuses on application layer mobility management schemes for <b>wireless</b> Internet <b>telephony</b> and multicast content distribution in a mobile environment involving heteroge-neous access networks. We propose an application layer mobility management scheme for <b>wireless</b> Internet <b>telephony</b> and streaming services. We focus our analysis on {{certain aspects of the}} design such as terminal mobility supporting security, quality of service and fast-handoff mechanism over heterogeneous networks. Many of the functional components such as signaling, registration, hand-off, and session continuity associated with <b>wireless</b> Internet <b>telephony</b> have been prototyped. We have carried out the performance evaluation with other layer three mobility management protocols such as Mobile IP, MIP-LR, Mobile IPv 6, IDMP and host-based routing such as MMP. As part of providing streaming services to the mobile users we have designed a multicast-based overlay con-tent distribution network called MarconiNet using extension of standard IETF based protocols such as SIP, RTP/RTCP, SAP and SDP. Several functional components of MarconiNet such as local ad-vertisement, handoff and quality of service associated with a scalable content distribution network have been analyzed. A prototype system has been built using hierarchical scope based multicast and application layer triggering techniques. ...|$|R

It has been working to de-monopolise the industry, granting several new licences in 2005. Fixed-line telephone service is a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Licences have been granted for competition in this area, but start-up is a while away.

At a private gathering before the flight, one of her guests, Guglielmo Marconi, spoke of the close association between aviation and wireless telephony: “Mention has been made of the possibility of wireless rays passing out through the terrestrial air into space, and of the sending of messages to Mars. Perhaps some day we shall be able to fly in those spaces outside the earth’s envelope, but if ever we do we shall certainly have to change the designs of our machines." ...|$|E
2500|$|The poor {{sales of}} the war years brought the Britannica {{to the brink of}} bankruptcy. [...] The CEO of Sears Roebuck, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, was devoted to the mission of the Britannica and bought its rights on 24 February 1920 from his friend Horace Everett Hooper for $1.25 million. The Britannica's {{headquarters}} were moved to Chicago, where they have remained. In 1922, a 3-volume supplement to the eleventh edition was released that summarized the developments just before, during and after World War I; these three volumes, taken together with the eleventh edition of 1910, became known as the twelfth edition. The articles describing World War I and the political changes brought about by it took up {{a large portion of the}} supplement, but articles on such things as radio (still called <b>wireless</b> <b>telephony)</b> are informative. The editor of the supplement was Hugh Chisholm, who also had been the main editor of the eleventh edition, as well as the 1902 eleven-volume supplement to the ninth edition, known as the tenth edition. Horace Hooper died in 1922, a few weeks after the publication of the twelfth edition. This edition was a commercial failure, losing Sears roughly $1.75 million, after which Sears gave it back to Hooper's widow, Harriett Meeker Cox, and her brother, William J. Cox, who ran the company from 1923 to 1928.|$|E
