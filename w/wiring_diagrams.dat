25|$|Colonel John Tiltman, {{who later}} became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy {{cryptanalysis}} office (OP-20-G) in April 1942 and recognised America's vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress, prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full blueprints and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> received by US Naval Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942. Funding for a full, $2 million, navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two types of sockets of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard type of socket system needs its <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to test nonstandard socket along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> as it has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked. Also use of other made hardware than national instruments with LabVIEW is described in nonstandard type socket testing...|$|R
