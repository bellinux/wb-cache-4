5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: {{men and women who}} have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|Referring to the {{original}} 50 workers, nuclear researcher Dr. Eric Hall opined that they {{were likely to be}} older, and unlikely to have further children, so the long-term effects of exposure to high-levels of ionizing radiation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> appear before a natural death. Some younger workers were injured and young Osaka firefighters were operating at the site. A group of 250 skilled senior citizens volunteered to work in the radioactive environment, citing reduced harm to them.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2002, 200 feet (60.9 meters) {{of one of}} VertiGo's 265-foot (80.7 meters) steel towers {{collapsed}} due to {{the removal}} of the ride vehicle as part of Cedar Point's preventative maintenance program. The vehicle was an important stabilizer of the towers and, {{as a result of the}} vehicle's removal, the towers were able to sway past the 8 foot (2.4m) sway allowance. The park was closed for the winter, so no one was injured. On March 11, 2002, the park announced the removal of VertiGo rides from both Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm, reasoning guests <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ride them after the collapse.|$|E
25|$|In {{an online}} survey carried out among over 75,000 Yougov panel {{participants}} in Britain, 90.9% identified as heterosexual, 5.8% as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 1.3% {{opted not to}} give an answer, and 2.1% gave other reasons. The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Ethnic minorities {{were less likely to}} identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not to disclose their sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). More LGB than heterosexual respondents indicated they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> disclose their true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue that the need for a recount <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|R
2500|$|However, the {{development}} of commercial production is made easier {{by the fact that}} exploration costs are very low. Such costs are a major factor when assessing the economics of drilling in a traditional oil field.

25|$|Alleles {{become more}} or less common either by chance in a process called genetic drift, or by natural selection. In natural selection, if an allele makes it more likely for an {{organism}} to survive and reproduce, then over time this allele becomes more common. But if an allele is harmful, natural selection makes it less common. In the above example, if the island were getting colder each year and snow became present {{for much of the}} time, then the allele for white fur would favor survival, since predators <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> see them against the snow, and more likely to see the gray mice. Over time white mice would become more and more frequent, while gray mice less and less.|$|E
25|$|Both East and West Paterson {{changed their}} names in hopes of dissociating {{themselves}} from the larger city of Paterson, which is significantly poorer and faces higher levels of crime, while preserving their E.P. and W.P. initials. In West Paterson, proponents of name change argued that their proposal would improve the borough's reputation and thus property values within the borough, as outsiders <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> confuse it with Paterson. Opponents of the renaming saw no need to change, with businesses and the fire department citing the cost of changing references to the borough's name {{and the consequences of}} forgetting the community's history as West Paterson. The name change has been marred with accusations of racism and discrimination due to the city of Paterson's lower quality of life and diverse minority demographics. Some Paterson residents and advocates have jokingly suggested renaming Paterson to East Woodland Park and West Elmwood Park.|$|E
25|$|Some {{news outlets}} have called into {{question}} why the Baltimore County Crisis Intervention Team was not deployed. Police say trained negotiators were involved but could not respond {{as to why the}} unit was not dispatched. Others suggest there are deficiencies in the way law enforcement attempt to deescalate interactions in minority communities, suggesting that Gaines' interactions with police may have been shaped by attitudes and beliefs regarding police and the justice system in urban black communities. According to Vox Media reports, legally, the police officers only must reasonably believe that their lives were in immediate danger, but are not required to ascertain whether the shooting victim actually posed a threat, however, activists maintain the police should have sought other means of resolving the conflict. Others have called for the hiring of more female police officers, arguing that policewomen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use lethal force to resolve conflicts.|$|E

50|$|True effect {{says that}} the object implied to have existed does exist. With that, the respondent's recall is strengthened, more readily available, and easier to {{extrapolate}} from. In true effect, presuppositions make a detail more readily recalled. For example, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> that a respondent would remember a wallet was blue if the prompt {{did not say that}} it was blue. False effect is that the object implied to have existed never was present. Despite this, the respondent is convinced otherwise and allows it to manipulate their memory. It can also alter responses to later questions to keep consistency. Regardless of the effect being true or false, the respondent is attempting to conform to the supplied information, because they assume it to be true.|$|R

25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use {{a method of}} homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard {{she would have to}} hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
25|$|Following the committal hearing, the Attorney-General advised Devlin that {{he would}} not be using the {{evidence}} regarding the Hullets in the Morrell trial, but seeking a second indictment relating to Mrs Hullett, which he did on 5 March 1957. Had this been proceeded with, a second committal hearing would have been required. The trial on the indictment relating to Mrs Morrell started on 18 March 1957 at the Old Bailey, with that relating to Mrs Hullett held back for a possible second separate trial. Three days later, a new Homicide Act came into effect; a single murder by poison became a non-capital offence. Adams, having been indicted on both charges before this date, would still face the death penalty if convicted. The Home Secretary <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> grant clemency in the case of a second murder conviction in the Hullett case, as this would make it far more difficult politically to sentence Adams to life imprisonment, particularly as a double murder could still be capital under the 1957 Homicide Act, and Devlin considered that the Attorney-General's aim in bringing forward a second indictment was to make it more likely that Adams would hang.|$|E
500|$|Canning's defence {{began with}} opening {{statements}} from Williams and Morton. [...] The latter emphasised her misfortune at twice {{being subjected to}} such anguish, firstly for prosecuting her assailants and secondly for being punished for doing so. [...] He complimented the jury and poured scorn on Davy's allegations, and seized upon the prosecution's unwillingness to call Virtue Hall to the stand. [...] Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution's complaint about Canning's description of the loft. [...] The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> pursue their assailants, {{for fear of being}} prosecuted themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Water striders G. gracilicornis have a {{behavioral}} mechanism and grasping structures allowing grasping. Male water striders use {{what is called}} an [...] "intimidating courtship". This mechanism involves males using a signal vibration to attract predators in order to manipulate females to mate. Females face more risks of being captured by predators since they idle on the water's surface {{for long periods of}} time. If a male were attached to the female, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> for the male to be harmed by the predators because he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> resting on top of the female. Therefore, males will tap their legs in order to create ripples in the water to attract predators. The female become fearful, causing her to <b>be</b> <b>less</b> resistant towards the male. As a result, copulation occurs faster, during which the male stops signaling.|$|R
5000|$|Universities have {{conducted}} studies {{to compare the}} outcomes of the consumption of regular alcoholic drinks and of caffeinated alcoholic drinks.

[...] Another study surveyed 697 students from Wake Forest University and found that the students who had consumed caffeinated alcoholic beverages were more likely to drink and drive, take advantage of someone sexually, or end up needing medical treatment.

50|$|A {{limited edition}} {{book is a}} book that is {{released}} in a limited quantity print run, usually much smaller than publishing industry standards, usually less than 1000 copies.

500|$|After {{the failure}} of the talks across the Falls, even the facade of a united front amongst the nationalists was broken on 11 September, when Muzorewa {{expelled}} Nkomo and four of his deputies from the council after they suggested a new leadership election be held. ZAPU contacted Salisbury soon after, stating that they wished to enter talks directly with the government. Smith [...] "opted for the unthinkable", in the words of Eliakim Sibanda, reasoning that for all of their differences, Nkomo was still, as Sibanda writes, [...] "a seasoned and pragmatic politician", who commanded a not insignificant force of guerrillas. The ZAPU leader was popular, too, not only locally but also regionally and internationally. If he could be brought into an internal government, and ZIPRA onto the side of the security forces, Smith thought, ZANU would find it difficult to justify continuing the guerrilla war, and even if they did so, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> win.|$|E
500|$|No Saudi women's {{national}} football {{team will be}} competing at the 2012 London Olympics, despite extensive pressure from the International Olympic Committee. Still, in 2012, the national federation was quietly arguing with the International Football Association Board not to allow women's participation if they were wearing the hijab while playing. The logic they followed was that if FIFA allowed women to wear the hijab in recognised matches, {{it would be much}} more difficult for the federation to prevent a national team from being created. There is a lot of pressure being put on the sporting community to allow for national representation of women on the international team as the kingdom will likely be the last nation in the world to prohibit women from competing at the Olympics. If the Saudis can successfully argue the hijab cannot be worn in competition, it would make them less isolated internationally as other teams in the Arab world <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> compete in the upcoming FIFA Women's Under-17 World Cup. PRI's The World said in late 2011: [...] "Who knows. In 10 years Saudi Arabia might just have a formidable national women's soccer team." [...] A current female football player in the country said of the situation as it pertains to the national team: [...] "Our generation started the game, the leagues, the structure.

5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.

The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|R
40|$|The {{propensity}} of humans {{to engage in}} prosocial behavior is unlike {{that of any other}} species. Individuals will help others even when it comes at a cost to themselves, and even when the others are complete strangers. However, to date, scant empirical evidence has been forthcoming on young children’s altruistic tendencies. To investigate this 45 4 -year-olds were presented with a task in which they had opportunity to help an adult confederate retrieve a reward from a novel box. In a control condition children were given no information about the effect of potential helping behavior. Alternatively they were informed that helping would either cost them (i. e., they would miss out on getting the reward) or benefit them (i. e., they would get the reward). It was hypothesized that children <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely,</b> and slower, to help in the cost condition, compared to the other two conditions. This hypothesis was not supported: children across all conditions provided help at near ceiling levels...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} concepts in statistics is that within-group variation {{must be taken into account}} when judging whether there is a real difference between the means of two groups.

But if such variation <b>were</b> large, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> for the difference in means to be a significant difference. Based on the scenario we presented, it <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> possible to begin such an analysis, even informally, without some sense of what the within-group variation looks like. We would hope that students who have nearly completed a course in inferential statistics know this, and would seek out information on variation, especially when it is their statistics instructor who asked them to respond to the survey. Although students do select standard deviation as a desirable piece of information when they are selecting multiple pieces of information, when they are asked to pick one, they focus on just knowing what the group means are.|$|R

The penalty for refusal was death. The majority of Chinese immigrants who moved to America only intended to stay in the United States long enough to make a living and return to China, so they needed to keep their queues to ensure their ability to return.
