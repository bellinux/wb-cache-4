5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E
5|$|In July 1822, Edward Williams and Percy Shelley drowned {{when their}} boat sank during a storm while {{returning}} to Lerici from Pisa. Shortly before their deaths, Jane dreamed of floods {{and on one}} occasion thought {{that she had seen}} Shelley's ghost through a window. After hearing of their deaths, Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt over what to do with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to England.|$|E

25|$|The Railway, {{widely known}} as The Gare Saint-Lazare, was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban {{landscape}} of Paris {{in the late}} 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, Victorine Meurent, also the model for Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass, sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Roth {{married an}} Icelandic student Sigríður Björnsdóttir, and moved <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to Reykjavik. Cut off from centres of European modernism, Roth started {{publishing}} {{a series of}} highly influential artist's books, and to publish these books he founded, with Icelandic poet Einar Bragi, the publishing company forlag ed. In works such as Bok ("Book") 1958, cut holes in the pages and dispensed with the codex, allowing the reader to rearrange the pages in any order they wished, whilst Daily Mirror Book, 1961, used the found material of a newspaper cut into 2cm squares and then rebound as a 150-page book.|$|E
25|$|Next {{come the}} gods of the heaven. Eos, goddess of the dawn, rides sidesaddle into battle. She pulls back her horse and is armed with a torch which she thrusts forward. She is {{followed}} by Helios, who rises up from the ocean with his quadriga and enters the battle armed with a torch. His target is a Giant standing in his way. He has rolled over another Giant. Theia follows, amidst her children. She {{is the mother of}} the day and night stars. Next to her mother and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to the viewer, the moon goddess Selene rides on her mule over a Giant.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
25|$|He {{also spent}} time in Râmnicu Vâlcea (1827), {{where he was a}} teacher at the Orthodox seminary and, in parallel, lectured on {{religious}} music to the nuns of the Dintr-un Lemn Monastery. A scandal erupted after Pann used his position at the latter institution to seduce Anica, the mother superior's 16-year-old niece. Unsuccessfully offering her legal guardians to marry Anica in church, he eloped <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to Şchei. While there, he became friends with the writer Ioan Barac, whom he had probably met earlier, and who, according to Pann's own testimony, gave him lessons in meter. According to some sources, he also took a trip to Buda. The literary critic Tudor Vianu attributes to Barac and Vasile Aaron, whose work constituted an adaption of various chanson de geste themes, the merit of having inspired Pann to pursue a literary career.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E

500|$|In {{the role}} of belly dancer, Steinberg engaged in {{dramatic}} interaction with Bono, especially upon entrance and exit from the stage. At times Bono would sing to the belly dancer's image on the giant video screens around the stage. During the tour, Steinberg changed the colours of her outfit to match certain occasions, such as wearing orange and black around Halloween. Steinberg was originally reluctant to put her own activities on hold to continue on to the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg of the tour, but eventually agreed. Unlike others in the tour entourage, Steinberg exhibited a professional independence from the group and did not wait on their whims. In 1993, while still on tour, Steinberg appeared in U2's Kevin Godley-directed music video for their single [...] "Numb", first with her feet {{as part of the}} video's assault on The Edge and then <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> as she belly danced.|$|E

Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to the audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap her fingers and leaned into the [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

500|$|When Homer and Marge [...] "snuggled" [...] to {{celebrate}} this development, she became pregnant. Homer {{was not happy}} {{when he found out}} about Marge's pregnancy, and was completely unenthusiastic about the impending birth. Because of the financial problems caused by the pregnancy, Homer was forced to make a sacrifice {{and go back to the}} power plant. However, Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back, and placed a large plaque in front of Homer's desk reading: [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer was once again unhappy at his work, but when Maggie was born, Homer instantly fell in love <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Back</b> in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not understand what that has to do with Maggie's photos. Homer merely mentions that they are in the place where he needs them the most. The scene then cuts to his workplace where all of the photos of Maggie are positioned on the plaque on the wall, which now reads: [...] "Do it for her".|$|E

500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art to [...] "Free Free"/"Super Music Maker" [...] {{was photographed}} by Takashiro Akihisa, who also {{directed}} the accompanying music video for the song, and was revealed on July 18, 2007. There are three different artworks; the normal CD cover featured Suzuki kneeling down, whilst the DVD had her bending down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> towards the camera. The artworks {{were placed on}} the back of the jewelcases, and the booklet featured another shot of her looking upwards; when opened, her bottom half is shown on the other side of the book. Additionally, Avex printed the booklets in a special lenticular paper that imitated the LED lights in the background of the photoshoot. This shot was then used as the official vinyl cover, tinted in pink. Taken from the video shoot, an editor for the website Sanspo compared the art to the work of Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda, where he/she described the shoot as [...] "sexy". Another reviewer, reporting from Natalie.mu, commended its [...] "decorative" [...] lights and felt it expressed the songs [...] "technopop" [...] style.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of a Carey's {{personal}} family album. As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her a disgrace to the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child of a black man, with whom she wants to move out with. As she goes to leave the home, her mother grabs her arm and rips off a [...] "charmbracelet" [...] from her wrist. As she picks it up off the floor, she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E
