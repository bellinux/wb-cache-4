500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that [...] "We Are the World" [...] had [...] "stood the test of time"; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN said he thinks the key to The Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|E

The full-length album Worn Thin {{was released}} in July 2010 on Projekt, followed by 6 Interpretations, an EP of remixes. [...] "Weep has just become something that I am really interested in," [...] Hammer remarked, regarding {{the direction of the}} band. [...] "I think it's a band of people that are capable of making a really good record. No one in the band <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> the things that ruin albums: <b>we</b> don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> being popular, <b>we</b> don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> being part of the zeitgeist, <b>we</b> don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> sounding like another band, we just want to do our own weird thing".|$|R

In October 2000 Howard Rosenberg commented [...] "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping {{out the entire}} planet. It's actually quite moving. And she looks great on her bike." [...] Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel and Wonder Woman. Time commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had [...] "an emotional range unusual among action babes." [...] Conversely, Joyce Millman said [...] "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Buffy or Faith. And that's because Max {{is little more than}} lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows". In December 2000 People listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the breakthrough performances of 2000.|$|E
500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E
500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{wrote of}} the episode, [...] "This far into the show’s run, {{shifting}} to a much more dramatic bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late." [...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down {{the path of least resistance}} and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E

Perigard of the Boston Herald {{called it an}} [...] "incredible episode"; [...] "Walking Dead again proves {{it is one of}} the best dramas on TV and almost makes me feel good about paying my cable bill." [...] Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it [...] "delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the audience [...] "finally had a reason to shed some tears and remember just how much <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the original gang of apocalyptic misfits". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it [...] "served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it [...] "especially dull" [...] when compared to the previous installment.|$|E
500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And {{when you have an}} actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about,</b> hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E

[...] Paul Attanasio, in The Washington Post, criticized the screenwriters for being [...] "much better at introducing a character than they are at developing one". David Ansen wrote, {{in his review}} for Newsweek, [...] "though it is action packed, spectacularly edited and often quite funny, one can't help feeling that Carpenter is squeezing the last drops out of a fatigued genre."

2500|$|During the war, this {{curiosity and}} {{propaganda}} underwent a transformation. Most of the German population realised that {{the fate of}} the prisoners of war was shared by their own absent detainees, and, from 1915, the prisoners noted that the visitors’ vehemence had cooled. Little by little a relationship built on understanding developed, as Charles Gueugnier, a simple zouave, noted in his daily diary: “Beautiful day, many visitors around the camp; among this crowd black dominates: grief has driven away their insolent smugness. All these griefs that pass through, I sympathise with them and salute in them those who have died for their fatherland. Especially, all these little ones hurt me a lot, because it’s sad”. Work also allowed prisoners to know the population better and better, and the longer the war dragged on, the more relaxed these relationships became. Robert d’Harcourt notes: “The inhabitants seemed rather indifferent to the war. The neighbourhood barber’s wife [...] told me one day: ‘What the f___ do <b>we</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Alsace-Lorraine? Let them give it to the French and let the slaughter cease’." ...|$|E

In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should [...] "try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. [...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s.
