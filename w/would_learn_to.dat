If so, predators <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. She and Harry soon began a sexual relationship.|$|E

Eventually, the Poor Clares in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, but she {{never got around to}} it because the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that. Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to the United States {{in the summer of}} 1856 and began his college duties. Towards the end of his professorship, then-president of Harvard Charles William Eliot noted that Lowell seemed to have [...] "no natural inclination" [...] to teach; Lowell agreed, but retained his position for twenty years. He focused on teaching literature, rather than etymology, hoping that his students <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the sound, rhythm, and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words. He summed up his method: [...] "True scholarship consists in knowing not what things exists, but what they mean; it is not memory but judgment." [...] Still grieving the loss of his wife, during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge, an area known as Professors' Row. He stayed there, along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap, until January 1861.|$|E

[...] During this period, Stevens learned from veterans Rod Langway and defensive linemate Brian Engblom on the finer points of playing defence. [...] Head coach Bryan Murray also helped calm the fiery young Stevens, who <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> fight less and play harder.

500|$|Following summer break, Takao {{returns to}} school and spots Yukari. His friends inform him {{that she is a}} {{literature}} teacher and that she had been the target of gossip and bullying. Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> overcome her fears and be able to [...] "walk" [...] again. However, Yukari quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.|$|E
500|$|When Elgar was twenty-nine, {{he took on}} a new pupil, Caroline Alice Roberts, {{daughter}} of the late Major-General Sir Henry Roberts, and a published author of verse and prose fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife three years later. Elgar's biographer Michael Kennedy writes, [...] "Alice's family was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a shop and was a Roman Catholic. She was disinherited." [...] They were married on 8 May 1889, at Brompton Oratory. From then until her death she acted as his business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings and was a perceptive musical critic. She {{did her best to}} gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success. In time he <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career. In her diary she wrote, [...] "The care of a genius is enough of a life work for any woman." [...] As an engagement present, Elgar dedicated his short violin and piano piece Salut d'Amour to her. With Alice's encouragement, the Elgars moved to London to be closer to the centre of British musical life, and Elgar started devoting his time to composition. Their only child, Carice Irene, was born at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in Elgar's dedication of Salut d'Amour, was a contraction of her mother's names Caroline and Alice.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} Summer, {{a second}} airshow took place. It was called the All-Russia Aeronautics Festival, and it opened on then the new Commandant's {{airfield}} (...) [...] The air tricks that were performed by Lebedev, Utotchkin, and Mikhail Efimov, military pilots Gorshkov, Rudnev, and others took the city by storm. After attending that festival, [...] "Molly" [...] began reading everything she could find about flying, and met up with the many pilots who were all young and {{the same age as}} her. In Fall 1910, Golanchikova finally got acquainted with , a former electrician from Odessa, who took her on a flight as a passenger, and from then on, she decided she <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> fly.

2500|$|Four {{goals to}} one adrift by half {{time in the}} reverse fixture at Burton Swifts, Small Heath [...] "never looked likely to get on even terms" [...] as they lost 6–3. A {{friendly}} visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a slippery surface was ended with 15 minutes still to go, because of rain and poor visibility, with Wanderers 2–0 ahead. Although a Small Heath team weakened by injury beat Lincoln City 4–0, the Birmingham Daily Post suggested that [...] "if the forwards <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> understand each other's movements and play a collective game, {{instead of trying to}} shine individually, the result would be a great deal more beneficial" [...] to the club. They finished September in second place in the Alliance, behind Nottingham Forest, who had won all four of their matches.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conflict}} was finally ended in November 1419, when {{a peace treaty}} was signed, in which the Ottomans recognized by name Venice's overseas possessions, and agreed to an exchange of prisoners—those taken by the Ottomans from Euboea, and by Venice at Gallipoli. The victory at Gallipoli ensured Venetian naval superiority for decades to come, but also led the Venetians to complacency and over-confidence, as, according to historian Seth Parry, the [...] "seemingly effortless trouncing of the Ottoman fleet confirmed the Venetians in their beliefs that they were vastly superior to the Turks in naval warfare". During the long Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430) and subsequent conflicts {{over the course of}} the century, however, [...] "the Venetians <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> their discomfiture that naval superiority alone could not guarantee an everlasting position of strength in the eastern Mediterranean".|$|E

2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> do battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't {{have to learn}} anything else." [...] It {{was his way of}} saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{transfer}} to Chicago, during continued fieldwork in Arizona, MacNeish set out his future goals. [...] “First I <b>would</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> dig well and skillfully, then I {{would become a}}ble to analyze archaeological findings, and finally I would become a theoretician”. [...] It was during his fieldwork as an undergraduate and graduate student that he worked on his first goal. [...] At field schools across the United States, MacNeish absorbed the knowledge and techniques of anyone he worked with. [...] Synthesis of this knowledge came to fruition during fieldwork {{in the state of}} Tamaulipas in Mexico. [...] Here MacNeish made one of his important contributions to the field methods of archaeologists, fulfilling his first goal. [...] He pioneered a method of excavating caves that involved the stripping the strata off alternate squares from a vertical profile. [...] This allowed for greater detail and more meaningful divisions of an excavation. [...] Where many previous methods involved digging by arbitrary levels, the new method [...] dubbed the La Perre technique after the cave in which it was first developed [...] dug each distinct strata, or floor, separately.|$|E
