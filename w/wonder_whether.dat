5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|While {{long-term}} {{psychological and}} neurological studies {{have yet to}} yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, {{a few studies have}} provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.|$|E

5|$|The Machination {{performs}} a successful surgery on Hunter, and Ironhide is seemingly {{killed in an}} explosion set up by them. They now begin to manufacture their own army of Sunstreaker bodies. Shockwave and the Dynobots are excavated up by archaeologists in Eureka, Nevada and Skywatch takes over the area. In Oregon, two young humans <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> to buy Soundwave, still trapped in cassette player mode. Megatron calls Sixshot to come and speed up Earth's destruction, and the Reapers follow, eager to have Sixshot join their attempt to rid the universe of war-like species. Elsewhere on Earth, Ramjet's grandiose plans for a coup against Megatron fail when the Decepticon leader kills him in one-on-one combat.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
25|$|When você is {{strictly}} a second-person pronoun, {{the use of}} possessive seu/sua may turn some phrases quite ambiguous since one would <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> seu/sua refers to the second person você or to the third person ele/ela.|$|E

2500|$|Russell {{resolves}} {{the problem}} of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: [...] " [...] <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> Scott {{is the author of}} Waverley." [...] In this case, it is obvious that King George is not <b>wondering</b> <b>whether</b> Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the de dicto / de re ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence [...] "George IV <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> Scott is Sir Walter" [...] can be interpreted as: ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, the main areas of study were set theory and formal logic. The {{discovery}} of paradoxes in informal set theory caused some to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> mathematics itself is inconsistent, and to look for proofs of consistency.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{the image}} above, one might <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> {{adequate}} account has been taken {{of the difference in}} curvature between ρ(s) and ρ(s + ds) in computing the arc length as ds = ρ(s)dθ. Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on curvature.|$|E

Throughout the series it was maintained that Chappell was never fully fit because of a tonsil infection. {{if that were the}} case one can only feel sorry for the bowlers when he returns to full health.|$|E

25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie. The mannish appearance, uncharacteristic (in photographs) half-smile, and the knowing look in the picture has caused later commentators to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Dolores was signalling {{that she was a}} lesbian, but {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that she was and her appearance at this time may simply have been a fashion statement. The photograph appeared, slightly changed, on the cover of Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture by Laura Doan in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Amlaíb {{is known}} to have built a {{fortress}} at Clondalkin, eight kilometres west of Áth Cliath. This was an important seat of Norse power for more than a century. Significantly, the fortress was built on the remains of an old monastic site, which has led some historians to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> a similar thing might not have happened at the ecclesiastical enclosure of Duiblinn. The annals are silent as to the ultimate fate of the latter settlement and its community – no Abbot or Bishop of Dublin is mentioned after 785; the possibility remains that it was abandoned in the late 8th century before the arrival of the Norsemen, who simply annexed it and built their longphort on the site.|$|E
25|$|Without {{denying that}} sex and gender can offer valid interpretive {{strategies}} for the investigation of Artemisia's art, we may <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the application of gendered readings has created too narrow an expectation. Underpinning Garrard's monograph, and reiterated in a limited way by R. Ward Bissell in his catalogue raisonné, are certain presumptions: that Artemisia's full creative power emerged only in the depiction of strong, assertive women, {{that she would not}} engage in conventional religious imagery such as the Madonna and Child or a Virgin who responds with submission to the Annunciation, and that she refused to yield her personal interpretation to suit the tastes of her presumable male clientele. This stereotype has had the doubly restricting effect of causing scholars to question the attribution of pictures that do not conform to the model, and to value less highly those that do not fit the mold.|$|E

500|$|Both Carstenszoon in 1623 and Tasman in 1644 were {{directed}} to attempt to find a passage {{in the area of}} Torres Strait, but failed. Following these explorations, [...] the Dutch continued to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> there was a passage: [...] However, Dutch maps still showed Cape York and New Guinea as being contiguous, until James Cook, who was aware of Torres' voyage through Alexander Dalrymple, sailed through the strait on his first voyage in 1770.|$|E
500|$|Rosaline {{is used as}} a {{name for}} only one other Shakespearean character—the one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), {{although}} Rosalind {{is the name of the}} main female character in As You Like It. [...] Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. Rosaline in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's Rosaline remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. [...] These similarities have led some to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.|$|E
500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} more than a dozen Tornado prototypes took flight on 14 August 1974 at Manching, Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett stated of the occasion: [...] "Aircraft {{handling}} was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> this was not yet another simulation". Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the British Grand Prix at Gateshead {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} inaugural {{fourteen}} Diamond League events, but although competitors included Tyson Gay, Powell, Jessica Ennis and Vincent Chepkok, the attendance was unusually poor, causing the local press to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Gateshead's contract for the marquee event would be renewed. Those fears were to prove well-founded when UK Athletics agreed to a three-year contract to stage the event at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. The move prompted one reporter to lament that [...] "the switch is a major blow to both Gateshead International Stadium and North-East sport in general, but can hardly be regarded as a major surprise given the dwindling support for major athletics events in the region." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord's {{invocation}} {{of an era}} of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme {{at the height of}} the Cold War. The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia [...] "thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> the world and their being are quite what they always took them to be." [...] The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of Titanics passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.|$|E
