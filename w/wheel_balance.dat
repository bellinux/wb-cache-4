50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to adjust the <b>wheel's</b> <b>balance,</b> referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust the wheel's rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the <b>wheel's</b> <b>balance</b> spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} experiments in anti-magnetic watch-making are in 1846. Watchmakers from Vacheron Constantin {{were among the}} first to experiment with anti-magnetic features of a watch. However, they succeeded in assembling the first antimagnetic watch only several decades later. That watch was able to withstand magnetic fields because some of its parts were made of non-magnetic metals: the palladium-made balance <b>wheel,</b> <b>balance</b> spring and the lever shaft.|$|E

5000|$|The {{balance spring}} {{is a fine}} spiral or helical torsion spring used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> The <b>balance</b> spring is an essential adjunct to the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> causing it to oscillate back and forth.

In 1880, Vacheron & Constantin started using the Maltese cross as its symbol, which it still does as of 2016. This was inspired by a component of the barrel, which had a cross-shape and was used for limiting the tension within the mainspring.|$|E

40|$|The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission, {{scheduled}} for a mid- 2020 's launch, is currently in its definition phase. The mission is designed to investigate essential questions {{in the areas of}} dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. WFIRST will use a 2. 4 -meter primary telescope (same size as the Hubble Space Telescope's primary mirror) and two instruments: the Wide Field Instrument (WFI) and the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). In order to ad-dress the critical science requirements, the WFIRST mission will conduct large-scale surveys of the infrared sky, requiring both agility and precision pointing (11. 6 milli-arcsec stability, 14 milli-arcsec jitter). This paper describes some of the challenges this mission profile presents to the GNC subsystem, and some of the design elements chosen to accommodate those challenges. The high-galactic-latitude survey is characterized by 3 -minute observations separated by slews ranging from 0. 025 deg to 0. 8 deg. The need for observation efficiency drives the slew and settle process to be as rapid as possible. A description of the shaped slew profile chosen to minimize excitation of structural oscillation, and the handoff from star tracker-gyro control to fine guidance sensor control is detailed. Also presented is the fine guidance sensor (FGS), which is integral with the primary instrument (WFI). The FGS is capable of tracking up to 18 guide stars, enabling robust FGS acquisition and precision pointing. To avoid excitation of observatory structural jitter, reaction wheel speeds are operationally maintained within set limits. In addition, the <b>wheel</b> <b>balance</b> law is designed to maintain 1 -Hz separation between the wheel speeds to avoid reinforcing jitter excitation at any particular frequency. The <b>wheel</b> <b>balance</b> law and operational implications are described. Finally, the candidate GNC hardware suite needed to meet the requirements of the mission is presented...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design and develop a glide control {{mechanism}} for a middle aged client with autism at the Monson Developmental Center. The client enjoyed propelling himself backward in his wheelchair which could often pose a safety hazard if he ran into objects or into other people. The development of an attachable glide control mechanism would prevent the wheelchair from excessive gliding while still maintaining its freedom of motion. The design team first created a list of preliminary design concepts that would all {{reduce the amount of}} glide when attached to the wheelchair. These concepts included bicycle brake calipers, a friction clutch, a friction belt, a “Wheel of Fortune” friction device, a dragging brake, an electromagnetic device, a piston device, and a rotating brake. Lists of advantages and disadvantages were created for each device, and then each design was rated based on a priority matrix. After further analysis of cost and feasibility, the friction belt was chosen for development into a prototype. This design would include two belts which press against two hubs that are attached to the wheels of the wheelchair. The tension that this setup creates results in a greater frictional force between the belt and the hub, decreasing the ability of the wheels to rotate freely. The device was developed and tested for maneuverability, glide limitation, safety, <b>wheel</b> <b>balance,</b> and accessibility to the client. The device was then tested by the client and {{it was found that the}} glide control mechanism appropriately limited the speed that the wheelchair was able to reach, without inhibiting the mobility of the wheelchair...|$|E
5000|$|The {{mainstream}} {{transition to}} the use of stem-wind, stem-set watches occurred at around {{the same time as the}} end of the manufacture and use of the fusee watch.

However the reader of this article should not be misled to think that the winding and setting functions are directly related to the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>balance</b> spring.

50|$|The {{railways}} {{based on}} the Ewing System are basically monorails using a <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> for <b>balancing</b> the train. The main load (almost 95%) is borne by the single rail while the rest is borne by the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> which runs on the ground. Further, in normal train systems, the rails {{have to be at}} almost exact level of other rail, failing which the train may go off the tracks. By using Ewing system, this problem is solved as the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> does not need exact level to maintain the balance of monorail. In addition the cost of laying tracks also goes down considerably since only one rail is used. Another benefit of using Ewing System was that the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> could run on existing tarred roads as well as the macadam roads thus further reducing cost to lay down tracks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> or <b>balance,</b> is the {{timekeeping}} device used {{in mechanical}} watches and some clocks, {{analogous to the}} pendulum in a pendulum clock. It is a weighted wheel that rotates back and forth, being returned toward its center position by a spiral torsion spring, the balance spring or hairspring. It {{is driven by the}} escapement, which transforms the rotating motion of the watch gear train into impulses delivered to the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> Each swing of the wheel (called a 'tick' or 'beat') allows the gear train to advance a set amount, moving the hands forward. The <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> and hairspring together form a harmonic oscillator, which due to resonance oscillates preferentially at a certain rate, its resonant frequency or 'beat', and resists oscillating at other rates. The combination of the mass of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> and the elasticity of the spring keep the time between each oscillation or ‘tick’ very constant, accounting for its near universal use as the timekeeper in mechanical watches to the present. From its invention in the 14th century until tuning fork and quartz movements became available in the 1960s, virtually every portable timekeeping device used some form of <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{balancing}} of rotating bodies {{is important}} to avoid vibration. In heavy industrial machines such as gas turbines and electric generators, vibration can cause catastrophic failure, as well as noise and discomfort. In {{the case of a}} narrow <b>wheel,</b> <b>balancing</b> simply involves moving the centre of gravity to the centre of rotation. For a system to be in complete balance both force and couple polygons should be closed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{with the development}} of a two <b>wheels</b> <b>balancing</b> robot as the maze solver.

If the wheels can be driven in such a way as to stay under the robot’s center of gravity, the robot remains balanced. The main purposes of this project are to construct a robot with the capability of balancing upright of two wheels and also as a maze solver robot. The GP 2 D 120 IR distance sensor is used to achieve the balancing mode while the GP 2 D 12 IR sensor is applied as the input for microcontroller in the determination of the path control algorithm. The path control algorithm will be coded in ATMEGA 32 microcontroller. The balancing robot will perform as a maze solver without losing the balancing functionality...|$|R

50|$|The modulus of {{elasticity}} of materials is dependent on temperature.

50|$|The largest use of Elinvar was {{in balance}} springs for {{mechanical}} watches and chronometers. A {{major cause of}} inaccuracy in watches and clocks was that ordinary steels used in springs lost elasticity slightly as the temperature increased, so the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> would oscillate more slowly back and forth, and the clock would lose time. Chronometers and precision watches required complex temperature-compensated <b>balance</b> <b>wheels</b> for accurate timekeeping. Springs made of Elinvar, and other low temperature coefficient alloys such as Nivarox that followed, were not affected by temperature, so they made the temperature-compensated <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> obsolete.|$|R
