500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, {{and when it comes to}} the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E

60|$|John saw {{the truest}} {{kindness}} was implicit obedience; and Allen and Bobus instantly joined her, the latter asking what new tomfoolery Janet had brought home, Allen following <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E

60|$|The first break {{was from}} Allen, {{who came in}} tenderly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> saying that they thought her time was come for being ready for it. His manner always did her good, and she sat up, pushed back her hair, smiled, took the cup, and thanked him lovingly.|$|E
60|$|The cooking {{places were}} again {{prepared}} for supper. At seven o'clock {{the meal was}} served, differing but little {{from that of the}} morning; except that after the men had eaten the soup, and the meat from it (in France called bouilli), they fried some thin slices of meat in the lids of their canteens, and concluded the meal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{the crews}} of the war-vessels were summoned on deck, the men ordered to wash, and {{afterwards}} served <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> All lights were extinguished except {{one on the}} stern of each ship, and that was hooded. All hands were at quarters; all guns loaded, with extra charges ready at hand; every eye was strained, and every ear on the alert to catch the slightest sound.|$|E

60|$|Then he {{went upstairs}} to his wife <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea because she was ill, and because it {{occurred}} to him.|$|R
60|$|Next morning Arthur went round {{once more}} to Professor Linklight's. The {{professor}} had promised to read through the paper immediately, and give his opinion of its chances for presentation to the Royal Society. He was sitting at his breakfast-table, in his flowered dressing-gown and slippers, when Arthur called upon him, and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in one hand, was actually skimming the last few pages through his critical eyeglass as his visitor entered.|$|E
60|$|I {{waited until}} midnight, {{but there was}} no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no {{uncommon}} thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.|$|E
60|$|Seated {{upon the}} couch in her room, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> by her side and a {{cigarette}} between her lips, Katharine listened to the conversation which passed in the opposite room, the one which had been tenanted by Phillips. For some reason, {{the end of the}} voyage, instead of bringing her the relief which she had expected, had only increased her nervous excitement. She was filled with an extraordinary prescience of some coming crisis. She found herself trembling as she listened to Doctor Gant's harsh voice and the smooth accents of his interlocutor.|$|E
50|$|The Tunnock's Teacake is a sweet food {{popular in}} the United Kingdom. Teacakes are often served <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea or coffee.|$|R

6000|$|... "I got a {{new song}} you never heard," [...] he told her {{when she came in}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> [...] "I only {{remember}} the chorus though. It's the old man talkin' to some hobo of a hired man that wants to marry his daughter. Mamie, that Billy Murphy used to run with before he got married, used to sing it. It's a kind of a sobby song. It used to always give Mamie the weeps. Here's the way the chorus goes--an' remember, it's the old man spielin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ghost had in {{her hand}} a tray <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> on it. Fred watched her motions with intense curiosity, and kept {{perfectly}} still, pretending to be asleep. She {{went straight to the}} box in which Sam Sorrel slept, and going down on her knees, looked earnestly into his face. As our artist's mouth happened to be wide-open, it may be said that she looked down his throat. Presently she spoke to him in a soft whisper--"Will de have caffe?" [...] (Will you have coffee?) A loud snore was the reply. Again she spoke, somewhat louder: [...] "Vill de have caffe?" ...|$|E
60|$|He shared {{breakfast with}} Skipper, who, instead of eating, washed down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> fifty grains of quinine {{wrapped in a}} {{cigarette}} paper, and who complained to the mate {{that he would have}} to get under the blankets and sweat out the fever that was attacking him. Despite his chill, and despite his teeth that were already beginning to chatter while the burning sun extracted the moisture in curling mist-wreaths from the deck planking, Van Horn cuddled Jerry in his arms and called him princeling, and prince, and a king, and a son of kings.|$|E
6000|$|After he had {{concluded}} his narrative, which {{was interrupted by}} frequent question and comment, and after he had refreshed himself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea, he rose and said-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The Kyivs'ky cake or the Napoleon cake or the Prague cake <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> the cappuccino {{coffee or}} <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> the black/green tea are {{considered}} as the desserts-of-choice among the locals in Bar.|$|R
60|$|Presently, as Cuthbert {{was about}} to serve his master <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> wine, the tall page pushed {{suddenly}} against him, spilling {{a portion of the}} wine over his dress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, colonel," [...] one of {{the hosts}} said; [...] "this evening you may sit {{as long as you}} like, but if we are to have another drive to-day we must waste no time. A basin of soup and a plate of stew are all you will get now, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> {{afterwards}} to arm you against the cold, and a glass of vodka or kümmil to top up with. No, colonel, not any punch just now. Punch in the evening; but if we were to begin with that now, I know {{that there would be no}} shooting this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|Turning {{my back on}} the place, I said to myself, [...] "What a fool I am to be sure! Why could I {{not have}} been {{satisfied}} for once <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> with my lunch? I should have saved a shilling, perhaps eighteen-pence, to rejoice the soul of some poor tramp; and, better still, I could have discussed some interesting questions with that charming rosy-faced woman. What, for instance, was the reason of her quarrel with the apostle; by the by, she never rebuked me for misquoting his words; {{and what is the}} moral effect (as seen through her clear brown eyes) of the Anglo-Bavarian brewery on the population of the small town and the neighbouring villages?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{camp was}} bustling with activity. The horses were in, fresh and quarrelsome, with ears laid back. Kells was sitting upon a rock near the fire <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in his hand. He was looking better. When he greeted Joan {{his voice sounded}} stronger. She walked by Pearce and Frenchy and Gulden {{on her way to}} the brook, but they took no notice of her. Bate Wood, however, touched his sombrero and said: [...] "Mornin', miss." [...] Joan {{wondered}} if her memory of the preceding night were only a bad dream. There was a different atmosphere by daylight, and it was dominated by Kells. Presently she returned to camp refreshed and hungry. Gulden was throwing a pack, which action he performed with ease and dexterity. Pearce was cinching her saddle. Kells was talking, more like his old self than at any time since his injury.|$|E
60|$|They placed {{themselves}} {{close to}} where Hatta, the other messenger, was standing watching the fight, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea {{in one hand and}} a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.|$|R

6000|$|The {{first thing}} we did, before fairly getting into the palace, was to sit down in a large ante-hall, and get some bread and butter and a pint of Bass's pale ale, {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> for S-----. This was the best refreshment we could find at that spot; but farther within we found abundance of refreshment-rooms, and John Bull {{and his wife and}} family at fifty little round tables, busily engaged with cold fowl, cold beef, ham, tongue, and bottles of ale and stout, and half-pint decanters of sherry. The English probably eat with more simple enjoyment than any other people; not ravenously, as we often do, and not exquisitely and artificially, like the French, but deliberately and vigorously, and with due absorption in the business, so that nothing good is lost upon them. [...] . It is remarkable how large a feature the refreshment-rooms make in the arrangements of the Crystal Palace.|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] {{she said}} to herself with a hard sob, [...] "I have no right to complain. He told me he loved me and I was almost indignant at the idea, and told him he was not worthy of my love. There was an end of it. He was free to do as he liked, and of course put it out of his mind {{altogether}} as I did out of mine. How could I tell that the time would come when I should find out what a terrible mistake I had made, how could I dream of such a thing! How could I guess that he would come into my life again and that he would have the power to spoil it! What a fool, I have been. What a conceited, silly fool," [...] and so Mary Brander's thoughts ran on till they become more and more vague, and sleep at last arrested them altogether. She was awakened by Madame Michaud coming into the room <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E
60|$|We {{found it}} rather long from Genoa to Monte Carlo, {{but this was}} not so much because of the {{distance}} as because of the delays of our train, which, having started late, grew reckless on the way, and before we reached the Italian frontier at Ventimiglia, had lost all shame and failed to connect there with the French train {{for the rest of our}} journey. So, instead of having barely time to affirm our innocence of tobacco, spirits, or perfumes to the customs officers, and to wash down a sandwich <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> at the restaurant, we had an hour and forty minutes at Ventimiglia, which I partly spent in vain attempts to buy the poverty of the inspector so far as to prevail with him not to delay the examination of our baggage, but to proceed to it at once, in order that we might have it all off our minds, and devote our long leisure to the inquiry by what steps the ancient Ligurian tribe of the Intemelii lost their name in its actual corruption of Ventimiglia. It is a charming old town, far more charming than the stranger who never has time to walk into it from the station can imagine, and there is a palm-bordered avenue leading from the railway to the sea, with the shops and cafes of Italy on one side and the shops and cafes of France on the other. So late as six o'clock in the evening those cafes and shops preserved a reciprocal integrity which I could not praise too highly, but after dark there must be a ghostly interchange of forbidden commodities among them which no force of customs officers could wholly suppress. At any rate, I should have liked to see them try it, though I should not have liked to be kept in Ventimiglia overnight for any less reason; it seemed a lonesome place, though mighty picturesque, with old walls, and a magnificent old fort toward the sea, and a fine bridge spanning, though for the moment superfluously spanning, the perfectly dry bed of a river.|$|E
