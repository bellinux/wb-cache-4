40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} control scheme for {{automatic}} path tracking of a four-wheeled steering and four-wheeled drive (4 WS 4 WD) vehicle subject to <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> constraint. The <b>wheel</b> <b>slip,</b> containing <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> ratio in longitudinal direction and slip angle in lateral direction, is a vector that serves as an index to avoid the tire-road friction saturation. Using linearization and singular perturbation theory, a linear and order-reduced design model is obtained, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is replaced by its quasi-steady state for the controller design. We propose a control structure of wheel torque and steering to transform the original tracking problem to a problem of state regulation subject to input constraint. A low-and-high gain technique is applied to construct the constrained controller and to enhance the utilization of the constrained <b>wheel</b> <b>slip.</b> Simulation shows that the new proposed control scheme subject to <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> constraint coordinates well between wheel steering and wheel torque during tracking. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main control}} {{objective}} of an Antilock Braking System (ABS) {{is to increase}} the tractive forces between wheel and road surface by keeping the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> at the peak value of mu-lambda curve. Conventionally, it is assumed that optimal <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is constant. In this paper a grey sliding mode controller is proposed to regulate optimal <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> depending on the vehicle forward velocity. ABS exhibits strongly nonlinear and uncertain characteristics. To overcome these difficulties, robust control methods should be employed. The concept of grey system theory, which has a certain prediction capability, offers an alternative approach to conventional control methods.

40|$|M. Ing. Adaptive {{traction}} control can greatly enhance {{the mobility of}} vehicles on varying road surfaces. Traction control includes Antilock Braking Systems (ABS) and Antislip Regulation Systems (ASR). During braking, <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is controlled with ABS, while <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> during acceleration is controlled by an ASR. Since the friction between a vehicle's tyre and the road surface {{is a function of}} <b>wheel</b> <b>slip,</b> there is an optimum <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> value at which the best road holding performance can be achieved. This optimum <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> value will however change with differing road surfaces and vehicle speeds. Optimising the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> values has several advantages: both vehicle stopping and acceleration distances can be optimised, vehicle handling during in-turn braking and acceleration are optimised and tyre wear is reduced. Currently there are various ABS and ASR systems available, with the common goal of optimising <b>wheel</b> <b>slip.</b> These systems are however mechanically complex, while the operation of both these systems is usually triggered when some <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> value is exceeded. Differing road surfaces can greatly influence the effectiveness of these systems. The central theme of this research is the development of a fuzzy logic control algorithm for vehicle {{traction control}}. The control algorithm is tested with an experimental setup. The operating conditions experienced by an ABS are closely simulated in order to study the feasibility of fuzzy logic for traction control. The results obtained indicates the viability of fuzzy logic for <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control. Confirmation of these results, obtained with the experimental ABS, have to be validated during vehicle testing. The main goal is to improve the performances of existing traction control systems and the feasibility of fuzzy controllers in automobile applications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the design, implementation and validation of a coordinated lateral and longitudinal dynamics control for a racing four-wheel driven RC vehicle. The coordination is achieved hierarchically: a <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control loop stabilizes the fastest longitudinal dynamics, {{so that the}} outer lateral dynamics control can rely on non-saturated tires. Designing a <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> controller on a scale model requires the estimation of the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> using a reduced set of sensors. The issue of estimating the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> on such a small vehicle is addressed using a complementary filter. The presence of the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control {{enables the use of}} a simple gain-scheduled yaw-rate controller to stabilize the yaw rate dynamics and make the yaw rate gain velocity independent. The combined longitudinal and lateral controller is experimentally tested, using both repeatable tests with precomputed inputs and human-in-the-loop tests.

2500|$|A fairly recent {{innovation}} in automobiles is electronic traction control. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates {{the function of}} a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. It {{should be noted that}} this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a <b>wheel</b> is <b>slipping,</b> and only activates when <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> (i.e., you can't [...] "lock the differential" [...] in advance of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip),</b> rather the system is designed to expressly permit <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to analyze the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> for a passenger car in a various velocity, road condition and driving mode. The thesis describes the post-processing method to analyze the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> and identify the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness for maximum tire life and performance. Driving and braking behaviour of vehicle were both studied in this thesis for paved and unpaved sandy road condition which commonly the contributing factors to the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> to occur. The data used for the analysis is obtained through experimental test using UMP Test Car which has been installed with Wheel Pulse Transducer, Global Positioning System and DEWESOFT software for data acquisition purpose. The post-processing method was performed using Flexpro and Microsoft Office Excel. The post-processing method to analyze the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> was performed using the SAE definition of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> and the percent error in the distance travel by the car between free rolling and actual condition. Finally, the longitudinal force, the effective rolling radius and the longitudinal tire stiffness was determined for both driving and braking maneuver of vehicle on paved and unpaved sandy road condition. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> during driving maneuver is higher for unpaved sandy road condition compares to that the paved road. It is also observed that the longitudinal force of the tire is lower for unpaved sandy road compare to the paved road condition. The effective rolling radius of the tire during driving maneuver was determined to be lower compare to the free rolling radius of the tire. During braking manuever, the results show that the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is higher for unpaved sandy road compare to that for paved road condition. The longitudinal force and tire stiffness also observed lower for unpaved sandy road condition. The effective rolling radius of the tire during braking determined higher compared to that in the free rolling radius. The results concluded that the percentage of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is strongly dependent to the longitudinal force and the tire road friction. Therefore, effective rolling radius and longitudinal tire stiffness obtained can significantly use to improve tire design and construction. The results also can be use to improve the energy usage efficiency and fuel consumption of vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{active safety}} control methods for cars, i. e., the {{antilock}} braking system (ABS), the traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC), govern the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control based on the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> ratio, which relies on the information from non-driven wheels. However, these methods are not applicable in the cases without non-driven wheels, e. g., a four-wheel decentralized electric vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes a new <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control approach based on a novel data fusion method to ensure good traction performance in any driving condition. Firstly, with the proposed data fusion algorithm, the acceleration estimator makes use of the data measured by the sensor installed near the vehicle center of mass (CM) to calculate the reference acceleration of each wheel center. Then, the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is constrained by controlling the acceleration deviation between the actual wheel and the reference wheel center.

The piezoactuator located in {{one side of}} a rigid beam makes a displacement required to control the pressure at a flapper-nozzle of the pneumatic valve.

30|$|From {{the above}} {{simulation}} results, {{it is found}} that when <b>wheels</b> <b>slip</b> on the rail and the friction coefficient between the wheel and rail is large enough, unstable vibration of the wheel–rail system will occur, signifying that rail corrugation will arise. Therefore, the effective method for controlling and suppressing rail corrugation in high-speed tracks is to prevent <b>wheels</b> <b>slipping</b> on rails. If the <b>wheel</b> does not <b>slip</b> on the rail, self-excited vibration of the wheel–rail system will not take place. Thus, rail corrugation will not occur. The present result explains why rail corrugation most probably takes place in train brake sections of tracks. This is because the wheel is easy to slip on the rail due to a low coefficient of friction when a train is braked at a high speed. This result {{can also be used to}} explain why most of rails in high-speed tracks are not subjected to corrugation, where <b>wheel</b> <b>slipping</b> on rail rarely takes place.|$|R
