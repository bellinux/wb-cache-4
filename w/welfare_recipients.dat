5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements {{had been created}} {{in the first six}} months of 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and that the proportion of <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there was}} no formal tie between the {{participating}} groups, the NWRO refers to the June 30 demonstrations as [...] "the birth of a movement." [...] Broad coalitions of groups sponsored each city’s activities, including, but not limited to, <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient</b> organizations. Over time, {{there was an increase}} in coordination and cooperation between these <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient</b> groups and thus a nationwide welfare recipients’ organization was needed.|$|R

25|$|Wade Rathke founded ACORN in 1970, {{after the}} National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) {{sent him to}} Little Rock, Arkansas, as an organizer. Rathke had {{previously}} dropped out of Williams College to promote draft resistance for Students for a Democratic Society. Gary Delgado and George Wiley were also instrumental in its founding. ACORN's first campaign was to help <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> attain their basic needs, such as clothing and furniture. This drive, inspired by a clause in the Arkansas welfare laws, began their effort to create and sustain a movement to assist welfare and lower-income working individuals; they developed the Arkansas Community Organizations for Reform Now, the beginnings of ACORN.|$|E

During these years he protected, among others, sixteen prostitutes, nine <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients,</b> five preachers, eight bankers, ten school teachers, and four store owners. As his reputation improved, however, he was contracted to guard, among others, seven clothes designers, five models, seven judges, three politicians, six athletes and forty-two millionaires. He protected well-known personalities such as Muhammad Ali, Steve McQueen, Michael Jackson, Leon Spinks, Joe Frazier and Diana Ross, charging $3,000 per day, to a maximum of $10,000 per day, depending on the clientele's risk-rate and traveling locations.|$|E

25|$|An October 2012 {{study by}} the American Association of University Women found that {{over the course of}} a 35-year career, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2million less than a man with the same education. Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a {{stimulus}} effect that would grow the U.S. economy by at least 3% to 4%. Women currently make up 70 percent of Medicaid recipients and 80 percent of <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients.</b> Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, a {{television}} licence {{is required for}} any address at which there is {{a television}} set or device not exempted under Staturory Instrument 319 of 2009 see. In 2008, the annual licence fee is €160. Revenue is collected by An Post, the Irish postal service. The bulk of the fee is used to fund Raidió Teilifís Éireann, the state broadcaster. The licence must be paid for any premises that has any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals, even those that are not RTÉ's. The licence is free to senior citizens (to anyone over the age of 70, some over 66), some Social <b>Welfare</b> <b>recipients,</b> and individuals who are blind. The fee for the licences of such beneficiaries is paid for by the state.|$|E
25|$|Democrats held a small {{majority}} in the General Assembly during Schricker's first two years in office, but in the midterms, Republicans again took power. They passed legislation to make public the names of <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> and the amounts received. This was in violation of federal welfare laws, and {{would have resulted in}} a loss of federal funding for the state welfare system. Schricker vetoed the bill, but the legislature overrode his veto. The federal government immediately cut off funding, creating an $18 million budget deficit for the state. Schricker called a special session of the legislature to resolve the financial situation, but no solution could be agreed upon. Instead the legislators passed a bill that delayed the opening of the public welfare records by two years. Meanwhile, Senator William E. Jenner successfully introduced legislation at the federal level to prevent the state from losing its funding once the bill took effect.|$|E
50|$|From the 1970s onwards, women {{became the}} {{predominant}} face of poverty. In a 1999 study by Franklin Gilliam that examined people's attitudes on race, gender, and the media, an eleven-minute news clip featuring {{one of two}} stories on welfare was shown to two groups of participants. Each story on welfare had a different recipient—one was a white woman {{and the other was}} a black woman. The results showed that people were extremely accurate in their recall of the race and gender of the black female <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient</b> in comparison to those who saw the story with the white female <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient.</b> This outcome confirmed that this unbalanced narrative of gender and race had become a standard cultural bias and that Americans often made implicit associations between race, gender, and poverty.|$|R

We use the subsample of the PASS consisting of households that were drawn from the administrative data covering the population of <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient</b> households.|$|R
25|$|This {{change in}} {{demographics}} coincided {{with changes in}} the local economy. Rising energy costs, advances in transportation, and {{the invention of the}} steel can encouraged beer companies to move out of New York City. As breweries in Bushwick closed, the neighborhood's economic base eroded. Discussions of urban renewal took place in the 1960s, but never materialized, resulting in the demolition of many residential buildings with the intent of replacing these structures with public housing, but nothing new was built in its place as these proposals were scrapped. Another contribution to the change in the socioeconomic profile of the neighborhood was the John Lindsay administration's policy of raising rent for <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients.</b> Since these tenants now brought higher rents than ordinary tenants would pay on the open market, Bushwick landlords actively began to fill vacant units with such tenants. By the mid-1970s, half of Bushwick's residents were on public assistance.|$|E
500|$|Baird {{supported}} mandatory drug-testing for <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> {{and argued}} that those who refused such tests should be at risk of have their assistance cut off. He introduced a policy initiative to this effect {{at a press conference}} in late 2000, in which he dramatically cast a box of syringes onto the floor and said that his department planned to [...] "stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success". Baird acknowledged that his department did not have reliable figures on the number of <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> abusing drugs, although he cited estimates of between 4% and 10%. The proposal was criticized by several people, including Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Keith Norton, a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, who expressed concern that it could violate Ontario's human rights code, but officials including Baird justified the measures as, [...] "necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence." ...|$|E

Two girls of the Relf family in Mississippi, deemed mentally incompetent at ages 12 and 14, and also 18-year-old <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient</b> Nial Ruth Cox of North Carolina, were prominent cases of involuntary sterilization. Jet magazine presented the story under the headline [...] "Genocide". Critics said these stories were publicized by activists against legal abortion.|$|R
50|$|Critics of {{the reforms}} {{sometimes}} {{point out that the}} massive decrease of people on the welfare rolls during the 1990s wasn't due to a rise in actual gainful employment in this population, but rather, was due almost exclusively to their offloading into workfare, giving them a different classification than classic <b>welfare</b> <b>recipient.</b> The late 1990s were also considered an unusually strong economic time, and critics voiced their concern about what would happen in an economic downturn.|$|R
500|$|The {{organization}} {{was very successful}} at committing major corporations with large presences {{in the black community}} to adopt affirmative action programs in which they hired more black executives and supervisors and to buy from black suppliers, wholesalers, and distributors. [...] The organization employed prayer vigils as a technique to call attention to issues. [...] The organization opposed Ronald Reagan's workfare initiative to compel that <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> work for part of their benefits.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Baird's announcement, a {{government}} website {{operated by the}} Ministry of Community and Social Services launched an attack against Liberal Party leader Dalton McGuinty for opposing the drug testing plan. The site claimed that McGuinty was [...] "opposed to helping <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> who are addicted to drugs". Baird denied that the message was partisan and initially refused to apologize. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario subsequently ruled that the site content was inappropriate and it was removed by the government, with an apology.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Baird {{announced}} that his government's proposed drug-testing {{plan would be}} extended to identify <b>welfare</b> <b>recipients</b> addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. He later {{announced that}} provincial welfare applicants {{would be required to}} pass a literacy test. The Harris government's welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001 after a pregnant woman in Sudbury, Kimberly Rogers, died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud. The woman had been confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was [...] "exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment". Responding to criticism, Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner's inquest was completed. He defended his government's general policy on welfare issues. A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman's death, but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated, and that adequate food, housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest.|$|E
