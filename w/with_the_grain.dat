5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, Diocletian {{effected}} a large {{increase in}} the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it. The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the civil service doubled from 15,000 to 30,000. The classicist Roger Bagnall estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5–10,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (no one knows the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century Song dynasty China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50–65 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per diocese depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13–15,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their comitatus, with the praetorian prefects, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.|$|E

50|$|A transgranular {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{that follows the}} edges of lattices in a granular material, ignoring <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> in <b>the</b> individual lattices.

25|$|Nowadays, as {{in other}} western Canadian cities, the old {{warehouses}} have long since outlived their utility as the railways {{have given way to}} the trucking on the highways as the preferred mode of commercial transport: in western Canada, as elsewhere, shipping by rail was supplanted by highway trucking once the Trans-Canada highway was extended from Ontario to the West and transport from eastern to western Canada no longer needed to dip into the United States below the Great Lakes. The old warehouses, however, have survived long enough that their destruction is not a foregone conclusion: they are, in Regina {{as in other}} North American cities, being turned into residential condominiums, tony restaurants and shopping precincts.

500|$|During the Victorian period, {{the art of}} book {{illustration}} gained popularity, supported {{through the}} work of wood engravers. Woodcut extended back centuries in Europe and further in Asia. Typically the parts to be printed in black were left in relief by the carver, allowing illustrations to be printed along with the text. Thomas Bewick developed the technique in the 18th century and [...] "perfected the process that was used extensively throughout the 19th century, which necessitated the use of hardwood blocks and tools for metal engraving". The preferred method of relief engraving had been to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> on the plank side of a block; however Bewick worked {{the end of the}} block and carved against the grain using a burin.

Haynes spent five and a half weeks making detailed notes on Gonçalves's assembly edit, and produced his director's cut within four weeks.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} research works {{a thorough}} understanding on how <b>grain</b> size influences <b>the</b> electrochemical behavior of metals is still lacking due to the inability to decouple grain size effects from other microstructural characteristics. In this work, the combination of potentiodynamic polarization measurements and the gold-nanoplating technique was used on high purity copper to further explore this relationship. The high purity copper was thermomechanically processed {{in such a way}} that three samples were produced with markedly different average grain sizes, namely 1. 4, 48 and 191 A mu m. All other parameters influencing the electrochemical behavior, such as internal stresses and texture were kept constant; microstructural characterization was performed by electron backscatter diffraction.
