The East Hudson Parkway Authority (EHPA) originally proposed raising the tolls on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways and building new tolls on the Hutchinson, along with the Bronx River and Taconic parkways. However, NYSDOT reported during a meeting in Albany that contracts on the new extension would be given in 1978.

The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed Mellon's proposals, but some congressmen, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> tax rates on corporations, fought the measure. Harding was unsure what side to endorse, telling a friend, [...] "I can't make a damn thing out of this tax problem.

[...] Harding tried compromise, and gained passage of the bill in the House {{after the end of}} the excess profits tax was delayed a year. In the Senate, the tax bill became entangled in efforts to vote World War I veterans a soldier's bonus. Frustrated by the delays, on July 12, Harding appeared before the Senate and urged it to pass the tax legislation without the bonus. It was not until November that the revenue bill finally passed, with higher rates than Mellon had proposed.|$|E
