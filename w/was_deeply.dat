5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> {{involved in the}} Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland.

He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> affected by Chopin's death.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.'

5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover.

It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E

5|$|For two years, Hand {{tried to}} succeed {{as a lawyer}} by force of will, giving all his time to the practice. By 1900, he <b>was</b> <b>deeply</b> {{dissatisfied}} with his progress.

He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at Albany Law School, and joined a lawyers' discussion group in New York City. He also developed an interest in politics.|$|E

Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to the readiness of the Me 262for combat operations.|$|E

Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E
