Faye, angered by Mark and Natasha's behaviour, moved into the village with Ryan, wanting them {{to get to know each}} other. Natasha, however, insisted that Mark arrange a job for Ryan in Dubai, which he initially did but later withdrew only days before Ryan was due to leave, as he had bonded with Ryan. Natasha was not happy, <b>warning</b> <b>Mark</b> that it was only a matter of time before the truth came out.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Frank Cassilis (Gilbert), a wanderer, returns once each year to {{a spot on the}} bleak Scottish coast to fulfill his word of honor to his archenemy Northmour (Northrup), a wealthy soldier of fortune in whose hands hang his life. During the visit in 1860 during the night Northmour lands from his yacht in company with Bernard Huddlestone (Aitken), a London banker fleeing from the danger of the Society of Carbonari, formed of Italians in London. The white circle is the <b>warning</b> <b>mark</b> used by this society. Huddlestone has misused funds entrusted to him by the society and lost them in speculation, so he has bargained away his daughter Clara (Wilson) to Northmour for his protection. Accompanying them on this night, she finds love when she sees Cassilis. Later, following the death of Huddlestone and the burning of Northmour's great home on the Scottish shore by the Italians, the worth of Northmour's reputed character is revealed when he leaves the young woman with Cassilis and spares the latter's life.|$|E

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} need obstacle warning aids to {{help the}} crew of airplanes, helicopters and ships to avoid collisions with the turbines. So far, the organizations performing the logistics of applying for building permits, site preparation and erection of wind turbines have generally handled each such activity as an isolated event. Thus, obstacle warning lights or markings have been applied as seen fit for the particular wind turbine or group of turbines. Obstacle markings have to be visible for aviators and seamen, this is obvious, but may be an annoyance to the public dwelling in the neighbourhood. This will put demands on the functioning and intensity of the system. For example: an unsynchronized blinking of light may have an adverse effect on the public acceptance of a wind farm. Two international organisations, ICAO 1 and IALA 2 work with recommendations for marking of wind turbines. ICAO {{is currently working on}} producing requirements specifically for marking and lighting wind turbines but have not yet completed these deliberations. The ICAO requirements for marking and lighting obstacles apply to all obstacles including wind turbines at present. But, there is still not a unifying agreement on the aviation <b>warning</b> <b>marking</b> lights. From a few meetings in Sweden on this topic it appears that the present sea markings, for fixed obstacles, will be accepted in their present IALA forms without modifications. Participants/Presentations A total of eight participants attended this meeting with representatives from Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. The participants represented both maritime and aviation interests as well as manufacturers and developers. Five presentations were given on the following topics...|$|R
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the flood {{fatality}} with a view to identifying risks which may inform public policy responses to future flood. On July 21 st, 2012, Beijing suffered the heaviest rain since 1963. The average rainfall was 215 mm over a 24 hour period in the central city (301 mm in Fangshan District). The rain resulted in a flood that caused severe health, social and financial impact. Results This flood caused 79 deaths. Of the 71 deaths for which a specific cause could be identified, 5 were rescue team members, 42 were killed by drowning (11 in the car), and the others by electricity shock, fallen house, falling items and lightning. The total financial cost was estimated to be US 1. 7 billion. The causations of the deaths inform the risks associated with the flood. Discussion This flood had a catastrophic impact on Beijing, mainly due to the intensity of the rain (the rain was the heaviest in the modern Beijing history; possibly due to global warming and urban heat island effect), the vulnerability of the infrastructure (poor standards of drainage, disorganized water management systems and decreased permeability of the earth as a result of the city’s rapid development), and the capacity of the response system (mainly dependent on the awareness of the citizens, warning systems and the capacity of the emergency rescue). Implication Many risk management measures have been implemented as a result of this flood, including water level <b>warning</b> <b>marks,</b> flood safety education and warnings sent to mobile phones, a project to move about 74, 500 farmers away from the flood-prone areas within 5 years. However, further measures targeted at the fundamental issues identified by this analysis are necessary, especially those targeting at health issues. These may include better planning, improved drainage systems and ecological development to increase permeability etc. ...|$|R

30|$|In this work, the optimizer filters the <b>warnings</b> {{and only}} <b>marks</b> {{them as a}} PUE attack when the anomaly {{continues}} for a configurable time. Each node has a window {{time in order to}} manage the spurious effects of the channel and to minimize the false alarms. This window time is configurable depending on the PU transmission rate. If a node detects a configurable number of anomalies in this time, it generates a node-level alarm in the system by sending a message through the VCC channel. When the window time is running out, all the anomalies are removed. The specific values of these parameters are presented in Section 6.2. The window time improves the results, reducing the random effects of the channel.|$|R

This paper deals with the preparation of an early warning system, aimed to predict {{the beginning of the}} CCHF season in Turkey based on a clear, simple and repeatable remotely-sensed signal. Decadal (mean of 10 days) values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 1 km resolution were used on a set of 952 confirmed, accurately geo-referenced, clinical cases between 2003 and 2006. A prerequisite is that the signal should be observable between 2 and 3 decadals before a given moment of the season to be of value as early <b>warning.</b> Decadals <b>marking</b> the 10 th percentile or the 25 th quartile in the frequency distribution of case reporting were selected as markers for the beginning of season of risk.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low <b>marks,</b> <b>warning</b> that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from GamePro, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that [...] "if you're looking for some classic shooter action on your new GBA, Iridion 3D will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the dance, {{the band}} Dio plays their song [...] "Holy Diver". The boys {{of the school}} hatch a plan to duct tape Mark to the {{flagpole}} while the adults also hatch a similar plan for Mark's father. When Rebecca enters the dance dressed up promiscuously and kissing every boy in sight, Mark is outraged and attacks Kyle for turning his sister [...] "into a slut." [...] The other boys perceive his beating up Kyle as cool and finally accept him; Randy Marsh breaks up the fight, with <b>Mark</b> <b>warning</b> Kyle he's not through with him. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswald arrive and interrupt the dance, looking for their children so they could leave. Mark gets onstage and makes a speech to his parents (particularly to his father) {{about the benefits of}} public schools - [...] "...it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves." [...] Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss. Mark's father, however, is then duct taped to the flagpole in front of the school by the adults, regardless of his change in attitude and opinion. Dio restarts and plays [...] "Holy Diver" [...] over the end credits, with Phonics Monkey joining in on drums.|$|R
