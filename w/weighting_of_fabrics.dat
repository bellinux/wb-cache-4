However, no study has investigated the ultraviolet properties <b>of</b> natural <b>fabrics</b> dyed with natural colorants. This study reports the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) <b>of</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> dyed with colorants of plant and insect origins. Methods Three cotton fabrics were dyed with three natural colorants. Fabrics were characterized with respect to fabric construction, weight, thickness and thread count. Influence <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> characteristics on Ultraviolet Protection Factor was studied. Role of colorant concentration on the ultraviolet protection factor was examined via color strength analysis. Results A positive correlation was observed between the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fabric</b> and their UPF values. Similarly, thicker fabrics offered more protection from ultraviolet rays. Thread count appears to negatively correlate with UPF. Dyeing with natural colorants dramatically increased the protective abilities <b>of</b> all three <b>fabric</b> constructions. Additionally, within the same fabric type UPF values increased with higher depths of shade. Conclusion Dyeing cotton fabrics with natural colorants increases the ultraviolet protective abilities <b>of</b> the <b>fabrics</b> and {{can be considered as}} an effective protection against ultraviolet rays.

Such goals as cost reduction, reducing installation time and increasing the service life of structures are accomplishing by creating new technologies of erecting buildings and developing ways ofquickconstruction, using different types of fixed formwork. One of themis textstone. Textstone is an artificial construction stone, containing on the outer surface the reinforcing fine-mesh shell with multifunctional properties, formed by the interwoven threads of a vigorous fixed formwork textile material (basalt, linen, silica and other glass yarns) adhered by binding material. The innovative construction technology of production and installation {{of a new generation}} of textstone buildings has been registered as a brand TextStone. The fundamental difference between texstone and reinforced concrete and all known building materials is that the whole outer surface of solidified light binders is protected by strong, vigorous and fixed formwork made from inexpensive textile materials. Manufacturing textile shells allows using it as an internal finishing material, reducing or eliminating the cost of finishing work. The use of fixed textile construction shutters during the construction of buildings has obvious technical, economic, operational, sanitary and environmental benefits: short construction time (from 3 to 10 days), compact packaging and light <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> shells, high fire resistance, frost resistance, ease of engineering services installation in the hollow communicating shells; minimal amount of finishing, roofing, heat and noise insulation works.

The type of abrasion applied included surface abrasion in dry and wet condition, edge abrasion in dry condition, and flexing abrasion in dry condition. Dry flexing abrasion was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other abrasion procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate abrasion damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the percentage losses in physical properties or (2) between period of abrasion and the percentage losses in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the percentage losses in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage <b>of</b> the <b>fabric,</b> yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of abrasion. The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the percentage losses in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of abrasion. Some abrasion procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater percentage losses in breaking load and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion than to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in elongation.

For this reason has increased social awareness {{about the need for}} protection against ultraviolet radiation. Since 20 years ago, and especially during the last years, the research of textiles protection has increased exponentially. The main areas under investigation are the structure <b>of</b> the <b>fabric,</b> the materials used, the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fabric,</b> the title <b>of</b> the yarns, the color <b>of</b> the <b>fabric,</b> and some finishings which are subjected the fabric to improve their characteristics. Also, the different ways to evaluate the UPF are under research. The most used system is the spectrophotometric method, although in vivo method and dosimetric systems are used too. In recent years, the dosimetric methods are being studied depth with new photo-sensible materials. In this paper an evaluation of different weft density and materials is done. First of all a weft density study is made to test what importance has as structural parameter. Then is made a study of three different materials like cotton, polyester and seaweed. That study concludes that the most important material of those three is the last one...|$|R

The {{alkaline}} hydrolysis <b>of</b> polyester <b>fabric</b> in NaOH solution {{in the presence}} of several 1 -alkyl- 3 - methylimidazolium bromine ionic liquids (ILs), CnMImBr (n= 8, 12, 14, 16) was examined in comparison to the use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as an accelerant. The <b>weight</b> loss <b>of</b> polyester <b>fabric</b> was found to be greatly dependent on the concentrations of ILs and the length of alkyl groups in ILs. C 14 MImBr and C 16 MImBr exhibited good catalytic actions. The use of C 16 MImBr as an accelerator could endow polyester fabrics with slightly higher weight loss in comparison with CTAB. In the presence of C 16 MImBr, the activation energy of polyester hydrolysis reaction was slightly higher than that for the use of C 14 MImBr as a catalyst. In summary, the CnMImBr with long carbon chain can be employed as the novel accelerator for the <b>weight</b> reduction process <b>of</b> polyester <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R
