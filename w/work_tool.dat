40|$|Objectives of the study: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to create a measurement tool, a maturity model, which enables companies to assess the implementation process of knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> and identify how to improve the implementation. The output of the study will be a knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> implementation maturity model. The model has been constructed, tested and validated by means of literature study, interviews and application of the model in business context. Academic background and methodology: This master's thesis research project falls under the category of design research and is heavily influenced by the research done by van Steenbergen et al. (2010) on the creation of a focus area maturity matrix. The model is constructed using vast amounts of literature, found by means of structured literature approach, iterating the literature based model by means of expert consultation and interviews conducted with six large Finnish law firms' Knowledge Work Managers. Findings and conclusions: The findings of this master's thesis research suggest {{that it is possible to}} create a maturity model in the field of knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> implementation. The created model provides an overview of the possibilities of knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> implementation. The model is constructed around four focus areas strategy, culture, methods and tools which are then divided into sub focus areas. The capabilities for each focus area are described and positioned in a matrix with maturity levels. Using this model, companies can determine the level of maturity they need to achieve the business results on which they have staked their resources, clarify the current state of maturity of their existing knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> implementation and identify and envision with clarity the requisite knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> capabilities needed to get from where they are to where they need to be. The companies can use the maturity model individually to benchmark the knowledge <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> practices and evaluate the company's performance at the given operational levels. The model identifies the steps towards more mature processes at every given process area and aid the companies to take these steps in order to proceed to more mature processes and therefore to better financial performance...|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> based only on &quot;common sense &quot; and good intuitions. But the history of technology is replete with examples of good theories greatly aiding the development of useful technology. Where, then, might we look for theories to help us design computer-supported cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools?</b> In this paper, we will describe one possible perspective-the interdisciplinary study of coordination-that focuses, in part, on how people work together now and how they might do so differently with new information technologies. In one sense, there is little that is new about the study of coordination. Many different disciplines [...] including computer science, sociology, political science, management science, systems theory, economics, linguistics, and psychology [...] have all dealt, {{in one way or}} another, with fundamental questions about coordination. Furthermore, several previous writers have suggested that theories about coordination are likely to be important for designing cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> (e. g., Holt 8], (Wino 86]). We hope to suggest here, however, that the potential for fruitful interdisciplinary connections concerning coordination is much greater than has as yet been widel...|$|R

50|$|To harden by quenching, a metal (usually {{steel or}} cast iron) must be heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature {{and then quickly}} cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil, tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 hot <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> steel should be quenched in forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be quenched in brine.|$|E

Close-ups of two prisoners (Louis and Émile, the film's main protagonists) indicate they've taken a <b>work</b> <b>tool.</b> The prisoner next to Louis occasionally looks on, looking somewhat bored. After dinner everyone goes back to their cell. After feigning sleep during a guard's nightly rounds, Louis and Émile sing the title song as they resume a project of sawing off the prison window. Émile cuts himself, and Louis kindly mends the wound with a handkerchief. The window breaks free and they attempt to escape. Louis is able to get over the retaining wall, but Émile is not successful. Louis escapes, accidentally knocks someone off a bicycle, and rides off on the bicycle. Meanwhile, we hear a chorus suggesting he's about to be captured (Ce sera bientôt fini = [...] "It'll soon be over"). Louis heads into a village emblazoned with the words [...] "Finishing Line" [...] - the cyclist he knocked over was in a bicycle race, and Louis has won first prize.|$|E
50|$|At least 25% of {{the input}} power must be {{dissipated}} by the cooler when peak power is utilized for long periods. In normal case however, the peak power {{is used for}} only short periods, thus the actual cooler capacity required might be considerably less. The oil volume in the hydraulic tank is also acting as a heat accumulator when peak power is used. The system efficiency is very much dependent {{on the type of}} hydraulic <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> equipment, the hydraulic pumps and motors used and power input to the hydraulics may vary a lot. Each circuit must be evaluated and the load cycle estimated. New or modified systems must always be tested in practical work, covering all possible load cycles. An easy way of measuring the actual average power loss in the system is to equip the machine with a test cooler and measure the oil temperature at cooler inlet, oil temperature at cooler outlet and the oil flow through the cooler, when the machine is in normal operating mode. From these figures the test cooler power dissipation can be calculated and this is equal to the power loss when temperatures are stabilized. From this test the actual required cooler can be calculated to reach specified oil temperature in the oil tank. One problem can be to assemble the measuring equipment inline, especially the oil flow meter.|$|E

The Evangelists' Window on the right carries the attributes of the four evangelists, the angel for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the bull for Luke, and the eagle for John. The faҫades are also decorated with various figures and ornaments such as four children playing with domestic animals, the staff of Mercury, the trident of Neptune for trade and shipping, two playing angels on the Domshof architrave, squirrels nibbling at the national property, a lion killing a basilisk, several lions with rings in their mouths, one with the key from the Bremen coat of arms, several other animals, a siren tempting sailors and a man with a shield.

40|$|Abstract. Although {{cooperative}} work {{is widely}} used in a daily basis, nonetheless cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> are not being used as their potential would suggest. Even though the reasons behind this fact are not completely clear, {{the truth is that}} users see current cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools</b> as a burden to their working activities. To work around this problem, the notion of locality-awareness can be extremely helpful. Additionally, if we adapt consistency models to the cooperative activities being performed by each individual user, then {{we will be able to}} improve their experience without compromising the overall application performance. For example, we can decide which updates each user is most interested in and which ones he should be unaware of. The VFC algorithm does just that but in the environment of ad-hoc gaming. We propose VFC for Cooperative Work (VFC 4 CW), an adaptation of the original VFC consistency model to the environment of cooperative work, namely document-based cooperative work. In this work, we first study the state of the art of consistency maintenance in cooperative <b>work</b> <b>tools.</b> Then we propose an architecture which combines a generic VFC 4 CW middleware layer with a cooperative work application. At last, we discuss how to evaluate a future implementation of the proposed architecture...|$|R
