5|$|D'Angelo {{promoted}} Voodoo with {{an international}} supporting tour in late 2000. While successful early on, the tour became plagued by concert cancellations and D'Angelo's personal frustrations. Voodoo has since been regarded by music <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> a creative milestone of the neo soul genre during its apex. It has sold over 1.7 million copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as {{a cautionary tale}} of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values. Alexander was used by these <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> an example of ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).|$|E

5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|Cortina {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in hosting writers, intellectuals, poets and editors from all over the world. Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow, Dino Buzzati, as well as Vittorio Gassman, Leonardo Sciascia, Leonardo Mondadori and many others, spent their vacations in the town and took part in the cultural life of the city. Through the years, this led to a continuous activity of literature festivals and book presentations, like Una Montagna di Libri ("A Mountain of Books"), held twice a year since 2009. The festival attracted to Cortina <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> Azar Nafisi, Peter Cameron, Emmanuel Carrère.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's previous work, Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E

5|$|In English, Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), {{often called}} the {{foremost}} satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they {{spent most of their}} lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang <b>writers,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, 2006, {{the pilot}} for Studio 60 aired on NBC, {{directed}} by Schlamme. The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12million people, but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The seething anticipation {{that preceded the}} début was followed up by {{a large amount of}} thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the blogosphere. In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> sources. After two months on hiatus, Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.|$|E

5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, {{known for}} his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world, and the animals who {{inhabited}} it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially {{in the name of}} progress. Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas together.|$|E
5|$|Ralph de Luffa (or Ralph Luffa (died 1123) was an English {{bishop of}} Chichester, from 1091 to 1123. He built {{extensively}} on his cathedral {{as well as}} being praised by contemporary <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> an exemplary bishop. He took little part in the Investiture Crisis which took place in England during his episcopate. Although at one point he refused to allow his diocese to be taxed by King Henry I of England, Luffa remained on good terms with the two kings of England he served.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{new school}} and ghettoblaster {{subculture}} in the U.S. during the mid-1980s, Radio belongs to a pivotal {{moment in the history}} and culture of hip hop. Its success contributed to the displacement of the old school with {{the new school}} form and to the genre's mainstream success during the period. Its success also served as a career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin. Radio has been recognized by music <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> one of the first cohesive and commercially successful hip hop albums.|$|E

5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers traces the story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. The metaphor of the villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a special}} {{appearance}} by Green Wing cast at the British Film Institute, on 17 January 2007. Pile, Greig, Mangan and Rhind-Tutt appeared. Some of the other <b>writers,</b> <b>as</b> well as Theobald and Heap, were in the audience. The event was hosted by John Lloyd. Green Wing appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series Imagine, entitled A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Studio. Some of the funeral scenes from the special were shown, and the presenter of the show, Alan Yentob, appeared {{as one of the}} mourners.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (1876) is an epic poem of over 10,000 lines by William Morris {{that tells}} the tragic story, drawn from the Volsunga Saga and the Elder Edda, of the Norse hero Sigmund, his son Sigurd (the {{equivalent}} of Siegfried in the Nibelungenlied and Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung) and Sigurd's wife Gudrun. It sprang from a fascination with the Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author's youth, and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story. It was Morris's own favorite of his poems, and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as T. E. Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw. In recent years it has been rated very highly by many William Morris scholars, but has never succeeded in finding a wide readership on account of its great length and archaic diction. It {{has been seen as}} an influence on such fantasy <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> Andrew Lang and J. R. R. Tolkien. The Story of Sigurd is available in modern reprints, both in its original form and in a cut-down version, but there is no critical edition.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{literary}} {{influence on}} film noir was the hardboiled school of American detective and crime fiction, led {{in its early}} years by such <b>writers</b> <b>as</b> Dashiell Hammett (whose first novel, Red Harvest, was published in 1929) and James M. Cain (whose The Postman Always Rings Twice appeared five years later), and popularized in pulp magazines such as Black Mask. The classic film noirs The Maltese Falcon (1941) and The Glass Key (1942) were based on novels by Hammett; Cain's novels provided the basis for Double Indemnity (1944), Mildred Pierce (1945), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), and Slightly Scarlet (1956; adapted from Love's Lovely Counterfeit). A decade before the classic era, a story by Hammett was the source for the gangster melodrama City Streets (1931), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and photographed by Lee Garmes, who worked regularly with Sternberg. Wedding a style and story both with many noir characteristics, released the month before Lang's M, City Streets has a claim to being the first major film noir.|$|E
