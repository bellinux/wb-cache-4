Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E

The first train—a construction engineers train—arrived in Key West on January 21, 1912, while Mr. Flagler's special train and other passenger trains arrived the next day, January 22, 1912, and that is considered the first day of service on the new route.|$|E

[...] According to executive producer and showrunner Kelly Souders, she and fellow executive producer and showrunner Brian Peterson kept Gough and Millar's original ending in mind when they began working on the finale, because the scenes that Gough and Millar had envisioned represented [...] "real wish fulfillments for fans".

500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973 in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up {{splitting}} {{time between}} the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, where {{he lived with his}} mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought I could bring something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> else was doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E

It would be a kindness, he said, because Tony seemed considerably distressed by the affair. The girl fancied that he appeared so when he came into the room where she sat beside a sinking fire. Only one lamp was lighted and the room was dim; while a cold wind wailed outside, and the rain beat upon the windows. Tony shivered, and his face seemed a trifle haggard when he stopped and leaned {{on the back of her}} chair.|$|R
500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know what you know you can do, not <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> else tells you to do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite." [...] Bigelow was fascinated with exploring [...] "the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of his or her aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> else is running from." ...|$|E

Although Schoolboy Q was against the idea at first, he ultimately agreed with the label. When the album's production credits were revealed, it was rumored that Kendrick Lamar landed production placement on the song [...] "Overtime". In an interview with New York City radio station Hot 97, Schoolboy Q addressed the hearsay: [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>everybody's</b> saying. I wasn't there to see him produce it but I remember seeing Cardo produce it. I mean I think Kendrick got some background vocals. He's done a lot of background vocals for me." ...|$|R

[...] He then ordered Arpaio's attorney to prepare a corrective letter setting the record straight, to be distributed to all MCSO deputies. Because of Arpaio's First Amendment free speech rights, {{the court did not}} require him to personally sign the corrective letter.|$|E
