5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> and George H. W. Bush {{at the time of the}} earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> as {{president}} and the growing involvement {{of the religious right}} in conservative politics, Goldwater's libertarian views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice and as such supported abortion rights.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} such criticisms {{and the initial}} {{distrust}} among black African leaders, Crocker persevered in his pursuit of a negotiated settlement for the related conflicts in Angola and Namibia. With help from skilled subordinates such as Frank G. Wisner and Vernon Walters, he managed to gain the trust of Kenneth Kaunda, the Zambian president. Kaunda visited the White House for talks <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> in March 1983, and agreed to host an international conference in February 1984 {{which resulted in the}} Lusaka Accords, a small but significant step forward in the search for peace in southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|Thatcher {{formed a}} {{government}} on 4 May 1979, with {{a mandate to}} reverse the UK's economic decline and to reduce {{the role of the}} state in the economy. Thatcher was incensed by one contemporary view within the Civil Service that its job was to manage the UK's decline from the days of Empire, and wanted the country to punch above its weight in international affairs. She was a philosophic soulmate <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> elected in 1980 in the United States, and to a lesser extent, Brian Mulroney, who was elected in 1984 in Canada. It seemed for a time that conservatism might be the dominant political philosophy in the major English-speaking nations for the era.|$|E

500|$|He {{supported}} {{political activist}} and labor leader Thomas Mooney's defense fund, but was repelled by {{the behavior of}} some of Mooney's supporters at a rally. Around the same time, he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War, which he put down to being [...] "a soft touch". This donation enhanced his liberal reputation. He also became involved in a [...] "liberal group...with a leftist slant," [...] along <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan.</b> However, when Reagan {{and he saw the}} direction the group was heading, they resigned on the same night.|$|E
500|$|According to a 1996 {{issue of}} U.S. News & World Report, a [...] tunnel was {{dug into the}} White House {{connecting}} the Oval Office to a location in the East Wing. The tunnel is purportedly accessed through a door adjacent to the president's restroom, {{which leads to a}} staircase used to enter the tunnel. The excavation of this tunnel, called [...] "Project ZP", was undertaken in 1987 to provide a route for the president to be quickly and privately moved to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center {{in the event of an}} emergency. [...] During the last days of the Reagan presidency, the Project ZP tunnel was allegedly used, in combination with the White House to Treasury Building tunnel, to allow Richard Nixon discreet access to the Oval Office for at least one consultation <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan.</b>|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1980, there was a {{short-lived}} [...] "Draft Muskie" [...] movement; Secretary of State Edmund Muskie {{was seen as a}} favorable alternative to a deadlocked convention. One poll showed that Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as {{to the fact that he}} was not Carter. Muskie was polling even <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> at the time, while Carter was seven points behind.

The episode, originally broadcast December 12, 1954, drew international attention and highlights were featured on numerous national media outlets including: CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and Good Morning America. It was later revealed that some footage from the episode was first featured in the 2005 documentary, James Dean: Forever Young.|$|E

A New York Times reviewer described Leslie as [...] "just as deft and versatile a lady as the character she {{is supposed to}} be." [...] For the second, she was loaned to RKO for The Sky's the Limit (1943), starring with Fred Astaire. Leslie's character introduced the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer song [...] "My Shining Hour.

2500|$|The GOP {{lost its}} {{majorities}} during the Great Depression (1929–1940). Instead, the Democrats under Franklin D. Roosevelt formed a winning [...] "New Deal" [...] coalition, which was dominant from 1932 through 1964. That coalition {{collapsed in the}} mid-1960s, partly because of white Southern Democrats' disaffection with passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Republicans won {{five of the six}} presidential elections from 1968 to 1988, <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> as the party's iconic conservative hero. From 1992 to 2016, the Republican candidate has been elected to the White House in three of the seven presidential elections—and only in one out of those three elections (in 2004) did he win the popular vote.|$|E
2500|$|He wrote {{hundreds}} of songs, many becoming major hits, {{which made him}} a legend before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including [...] "Easter Parade", [...] "White Christmas", [...] "Happy Holiday", [...] "This Is the Army, Mr. Jones", and [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business". [...] His Broadway musical and 1943 film, This is the Army, <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> had Kate Smith singing Berlin's [...] "God Bless America" [...] which was first performed in 1938.|$|E

[...] He met personally with several prisoners who described to the governor the deplorable conditions under which they were living. Laxalt sympathized with their concerns and ordered the prison staff to address the problems. When he was later asked by the media if he had qualms about entering the prison yard, Laxalt, a former trial lawyer, said, [...] "No, not really. Many of them were my former clients!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Recasting the American Dream and American Politics", Robert C. Rowland and John M. Jones, two {{professors of}} communications, {{argue that the}} {{disconnect}} between what policies {{the majority of the}} American public reported supporting (more liberal) and the political label the plurality used to describe themselves as (conservative) {{had to do with the}} fact that America's romantic narrative, the search for the American Dream, had become closely associated <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> and conservatives, and that in a keynote address unremarkable in its basic themes, Obama sought to recast the narrative as one associated with liberals. [...] Whereas Reagan's narrative focused heavily on individualism, Obama used the metaphor of hope to call for a balance between those individual values and community values, the latter also being necessary for the achievement of the American Dream.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Lyons {{was named}} finance {{chairman}} for the 1972 Republican gubernatorial candidate David Treen of suburban New Orleans even though Lyons's younger son, Hall Lyons, {{was running for}} governor on the American Independent Party ticket, an organization founded in 1968 by Alabama Governor George C. Wallace. Hall Lyons withdrew from the race and endorsed Treen, who lost the general election to Democrat Edwin Edwards. Unlike his son, Charlton Lyons had opposed Wallace, who had carried Louisiana's then ten electoral votes in 1968. [...] Charlton Lyons supported the Nixon-Agnew elector slate, which fared poorly in the state. Lyons had also held most in the Louisiana delegation for Nixon at the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, despite Lyons's personal friendship <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> who launched a brief presidential run on the Monday of the national convention.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace's {{strong showing}} {{was due in}} part to his appeal to ethnic neighborhoods made up of {{immigrants}} from countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Despite initial apprehension about campaigning in these communities, Wallace biographer Stephen Lesher credits him with recognizing that they were [...] "powerfully attracted to the message that the civil rights bill might adversely affect their jobs, their property values, the makeup of their neighborhoods, and children's schools". Others note that Wallace's anti-Communist message resonated with communities whose home countries were behind the Iron Curtain of the Soviet Union, and a series of blunders by the Reynolds campaign added to an existing resentment of Reynolds' tax policies and a recently passed housing law. [...] "What Reynolds and most commentators would miss," [...] Lesher writes, was that Dolores Herbstreith, who had never participated in politics until she became the de facto Wallace campaign chair in the state, was [...] "neither a racist nor a crazy ... less interested in race and the Communist menace than in sowing conservative seeds that began sprouting with Barry Goldwater later that year and flowered <b>with</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> in the 1980s." ...|$|E
