5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined {{with the majority of}} their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E

25|$|The Spaniards {{brought their}} coined money <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> 1521 {{and the first}} European coin which reaches the Philippine Islands with Ferdinand Magellan's arrival was the teston or four-reales silver coin. The teston became the de facto unit of trade between Spaniards and Filipinos before the {{founding}} of Manila in 1574. The native Tagalog name for the coin was salapi ("money").|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted theory of cardiac function prior to Al-Nafis {{was that of}} Galen. Galen taught that the blood reaching {{the right side of}} the heart went through invisible pores in the cardiac septum, to the left side of the heart, where it mixed with air to create spirit, and was then distributed to the body. According to Galen, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system except <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> contact through the unseen pores.|$|E
500|$|On May 25, Hesse {{sent out}} {{scouting}} parties {{to determine the}} situation at St. Louis. These parties were unable {{to get close to}} the village due to the presence of workers (including women and children) in the fields outside the village. The next day, Hesse sent Jean-Marie Ducharme and 300 Indians across the river to attack Cahokia, while the remainder arrived around 1:00 pm near St. Louis. A warning shot was fired from the tower when they came into view. The Sioux and Winnebagoes led the way, followed by the Sac, Fox and fur traders, including Hesse, in the rear. Leyba directed the defense from the tower and opened fire on the approaching enemy from the trenches and tower <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> range. On the first volley, most of the Sac and Fox fell back, apparently unwilling to fight, leaving many of the other participants suspicious of their motives in joining the expedition and complaining of their [...] "treachery." ...|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{occasional}} {{contacts in}} an earlier stage, the West only became well-aware {{of the existence of}} the Beta Israel community <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> contact through the Protestant missionaries of the [...] "London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews" [...] which specialized in the conversion of Jews. The organization began its operating in Ethiopia in 1859. The Protestant missionaries, who worked under the direction of a converted Jew named Henry Aaron Stern, converted many of the Beta Israel community to Christianity. Between 1859 and 1922, about 2,000 Beta Israel members converted to Orthodox Christianity (they did not convert to Protestantism due to an agreement the Protestant missionaries had with the government of Ethiopia). The relatively low amount of conversions is partly explained by the strong reaction to the conversions from religious leadership of the Beta Israel community. The Beta Israel members who were converted to Christianity are known today as [...] "Falash Mura".|$|E
2500|$|Beth McCarthy-Miller, then an {{executive}} with MTV, says the duo's poor English language skills, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> for their first interview with the channel, stirred doubts among those present {{as to whether they}} had sung on their records. The first public sign that the group was lip-synching came on 21 July 1989, during a live performance on MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol, Connecticut. As they performed, the recording of the song [...] "Girl You Know It's True" [...] jammed and began to skip, repeating the partial line [...] "Girl, you know it's..." [...] over and over through the speakers. They continued to pretend to sing and dance onstage for a few more moments, then they both ran offstage. According to the episode of VH1's Behind the Music which profiled Milli Vanilli, Downtown Julie Brown stated that fans attending the concert seemed neither to care, nor even to notice, and the concert continued as if nothing unusual had happened. In a March 1990 issue of Time magazine, Pilatus was quoted proclaiming himself to be [...] "the new Elvis", reasoning that by the duo's success they were more talented musically than Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger.|$|E
