Some paparazzi pointed out that this can be easily recognized when she started wearing a more plain ring which matches the ring on Otto's (her husband) left hand though she may have intended to wear it on her right hand (yet, <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> on the right hand is actually a tradition in some Europe countries including the Netherlands). It is also expected that Thu Minh would never hold a big wedding celebration involving the public and the press in Vietnam since she is well known for being quite secretive in her love life. This could be a reason that she may have chosen to celebrate this only with some close friends and families − to avoid the public attention. Besides, because Thu Minh only has contact regularly with very few co-workers at a personal level, the news, hence, was not widespread and was under cover for a while. Till now, the public only acknowledges her husband's face and he is a Dutch businessman (Her husband's name has recently been revealed as Otto). Her husband appeared on the event she held on 21 December 2012 as an event to introduce her husband and celebrate the ended year 2012.

40|$|LectureWear {{rings are}} a {{necessary}} feature of an enclosed centrifugal impeller design. The {{purpose of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> is to limit the leakage of fluid from the high pressure zone at the impeller outlet to the low pressure region at the impeller inlet. Several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries may be employed for this purpose. The choice of which geometry is utilized depends on {{which of the following}} goals are ranked most important: ? Pump efficiency ? Rotor dynamic coefficients: stiffness and damping ? Preventing contact during thermal or suction transients ? Resistance to wear from abrasive particles ? Allow later adjustment to recover original clearances as the pump wears There have been many papers published on the effect of <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometry on leakage, efficiency and rotor dynamic coefficients. However little is known about how specific <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries affect the suction performance of an impeller. This paper seeks to examine several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries in common use. It will then quantify how each of these geometries affects the suction performance of the impeller over the full design flow range. To facilitate this examination a test pump will be utilized with modular impeller eye side <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometry. The physical testing will be accompanied by CFD simulations and the results will be compared...|$|R

Despite his {{close ties with}} religious conservative tradition in Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences through Sabahattin Zaim, he was criticized of <b>wearing</b> <b>ring,</b> a symbol of liberal life-style in Turkey. He not only signed the declaration on freedom for headscarf in universities in 2008 against the ban on wearing headscarf in university campuses in Turkey, Yıldırım also declared his support for strike at the Tuzla Shipyards at the same year.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for the Icons of Wrestling program that aired on Canada's Biography Channel, and later Britain's TWC, Stanlee explained his concept of showmanship. [...] "When I walked into the ring, I would add a little showmanship to my style before I wrestled. I noticed that as I was achieving more and more showmanship, I started getting ideas. I seen that the sport was not bringing in women. So I starting glamorizing, thinking up beautiful costumes". Stanlee began <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> jackets, which was a rarity in that era, and also had monogrammed towels—"Wrestling's TV King"—which he wore once he took off the ring jacket. His elaborate entrance infuriated opponents, both faces and heels, but also meant he appeared on over 200 magazine covers during his career.|$|E
50|$|Mexican Lucha libre, or {{professional}} wrestling, promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held their Super Viernes show on November 14, 2014 at Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico. The main event {{was scheduled to}} be a rematch from the previous weeks Super Viernes as Los Ingobernables ("The Unruly"; La Máscara, La Sombra and Rush) going up against Thunder and Los Guerreros Lagunero (Euforia and Último Guerrero) after Thunder and Los Guerreros cheated to win the previous week. The day before the Super Viernes show Rush was injured during a match when he broke two bones in his leg and thus was unable to perform on the Super Viernes show. CMLL replaced him with Marco Corleone, someone who had teamed extensively with Rush in the past, even holding the CMLL World Trios Championship with La Máscara and Máximo. The makeshift duo came to the ring showing signs of unity with both La Máscara and La Sombra <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> gear in red, white and green, the color both of the Mexican and Italian flag for Marco Corleone. During the match Marco also displayed more of the Ingobernables aggressive style of wrestling instead of his normal tecnico ("good guy") style and attitude. In the third and deciding fall Los Ingobernables rushed in the ring when Corleone was about to pin Último Guerrero and attacked their partner. The confusion allowed Guerrero to land a low blow on Corleone to win the match. After the match Los Ingobernables left the ring, not caring that they lost while Marco Corleone took the microphone and challenged Último Guerrero to put his hair on the line in a match between the two.|$|E

40|$|The leakage flow {{paths in}} the {{sidewall}} gaps of centrifugal pumps are of significant importance for numbers of effects. The paper {{is concerned with}} the transient flow in the leakage flow paths with <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance variation. For this purpose, numerical simulations of the whole pump were carried out. The grid dependence and yplus check were performed first. Additionally, experimental data of performance characteristic and pressure fluctuation inside the sidewall gap was used to validate the numerical results. The transient velocity fields inside the sidewall gaps during one blade passage period were simulated. And the leakage through the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> gap was obtained for all operating points investigated. To have a better idea of attenuation and propagation of pressure inside the sidewall gap, the unsteady pressure distributions in the gap were calculated. Additionally, the surfaces of the impeller were divided into four parts. The fluid force on each part was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total radial force. Through comparing the flow fields, the pressure distributions, and the radial force between the pumps with different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearances, the effects of the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance were discussed in detail. The results can be used to guide the optimum design of the pump sidewall gaps...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aimed at the {{self-excited}} vibration of caused by unreasonable clearance in <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> of the Francis turbine, whole flow passage of prototype hydraulic turbine which contains the clearance in <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> is numerically calculated by {{computational fluid dynamics}} software CFX based on N-S equation and RNG k-turbulence model. The result shows that the flow field in front of inlet of runner is unstable extremely, even if a tiny disturbance effects on, which will be out-of-balance symmetrically in the radial direction, then the force of runner will be unbalance, which will cause vibration of the hydraulic turbine. As well as, a reasonable clearance in <b>wearing</b> <b>ring</b> of the Francis turbine will reduce {{the impact of the}} water in the inlet of the clearance, and {{self-excited vibration}} of the hydraulic turbine will eliminate...|$|E

This paper details the joint effort of the OEM and the user to resolve the problems associated with design and installation. The end result is a pump that has run for three years without incident, without performance decrease, and without vibration increase. OEM recommended hardware improvements include: *Metal to metal head to case fit *Larger diameter stepped shaft with split <b>rings</b> *Spiral groove <b>wear</b> <b>rings</b> and bushing *Remachine bearing housings *Interference fit bundle. User?s specified changes Include: *Metal bellow seal *Integral impeller <b>wear</b> <b>rings</b> *Hard coating <b>wear</b> <b>rings</b> and bushings *Provision for thermal growth control *Reduction of pipe strain. The lessons learned from this case history can be applied to pumps of any manufacture to resolve chronic reliability problems...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{actuators}} {{are commonly}} adopted in machines and structures to provide translating forces with significant magnitudes. Although their application {{dates back to}} the industrial revolution, their bending behavior under compression is typically addressed by simple Euler’s instability analysis on the rod, neglecting effects such as the cylinder inertia and stiffness, the presence of contact elements in the cylinder-rod junction and on the piston, geometrical misalignments and imperfections, and friction moments at the support. Such simplifications lead to unjustified reduced critical load calculations on the component. In the present paper, a complete mathematical formulation, which accounts for such effects, is presented and validated against experimental data. A numerical sensitivity analysis is conducted, to assess the contributions of initial rectilinear imperfections, <b>wear</b> <b>rings</b> stiffness and dimension, and supports friction on the actuator’s limit buckling load and bending behavior under compression. Results are presented, including the effect of the cited parameters on the buckling load, providing a reliable tool for the mechanical designer. In particular, an optimum position for the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> distance is found. Moreover, increased <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> stiffness and reduced imperfections increase the buckling load and reduce the bending stresses before the critical load...|$|R

2500|$|Like the Greeks, {{often the}} purpose of Roman {{jewellery}} was {{to ward off the}} [...] "Evil Eye" [...] given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only <b>wore</b> a finger <b>ring.</b> Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men <b>wore</b> a <b>ring</b> on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women <b>wore</b> <b>rings</b> with an engraved gem on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into medieval times when kings and noblemen used the same method.
