She meets Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), a British man <b>whose</b> <b>wife,</b> Jane (Cecily Gambrell), {{has been in a}} coma for several years. Ian asks Susan on a date, which forces her to face the unlikeliness of Mike recovering.|$|E
5|$|After grave {{difficulties}} in rehearsal, Tristan und Isolde premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere {{had been scheduled}} for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors, and also because the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was hoarse and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, <b>whose</b> <b>wife,</b> Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's wife, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure Antioch for her son, William, with the {{assistance}} of Leo of Cilicia (<b>whose</b> <b>wife,</b> Isabel, was her niece). Leo invited Bohemond and his family to Bagras, saying that he wanted to start negotiations regarding the surrender of the fortress either to Antioch or to the Templars in early 1194. The meeting was a trap: Bohemond was captured and taken to Leo's capital, Sis.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} near-poor parents’ job {{mobility}} is reduced {{due to the}} non-portability of employer-provided health insurance—an effect termed job lock—the authors examine data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation for 1996 and 2001, years bracketing {{the introduction of the}} State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Among the working fathers whose children met the SCHIP eligibility criteria, those <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> did not have their own employer-provided insurance were 5 – 6 % more likely to separate from their current employer in the year of the later survey than in the year of the earlier survey, whereas those <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> were insured exhibited no comparable change in mobility. These results confirm the presence of job lock: for men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> were uninsured, but not for those <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> were insured, the authors argue, the SCHIP program presented a new opportunity to switch jobs without losing health insurance...|$|R

John attempts to force him to rehabilitate, but Sherlock insists that he was undercover for a case. Mycroft confronts Sherlock about the drug use and realises that Sherlock is investigating Charles Augustus Magnussen, a newspaper owner who blackmails people. Sherlock has been enlisted by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood to negotiate the return of stolen letters written by Smallwood's husband. Mycroft warns Sherlock not to go after Magnussen, which Sherlock ignores.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} the cause of this {{condition}} was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a psychoanalyst based in Los Angeles, California, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease. The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.|$|E

5|$|After college, Wheelwright {{was ordained}} a deacon on 19 December 1619, and the {{following}} day was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church. On 8 November 1621 he married Mary Storre, the daughter of Thomas Storre, who was the vicar of Bilsby. In 1623, upon {{the death of his}} father-in-law, Wheelwright became the Bilsby vicar and held this position for ten years. His first wife died in 1629, and was buried in Bilsby on 18 May of that year. He soon thereafter married Mary Hutchinson, a daughter of Edward Hutchinson of Alford, and a sister of William Hutchinson, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> was Anne Hutchinson.|$|E
5|$|Although Belgium {{was officially}} neutral {{throughout}} his reign, {{significant numbers of}} Belgians volunteered to fight for right-wing causes abroad. From 1860, large numbers of Belgian Catholic volunteers went to Italy in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend {{the independence of the}} Papal States against Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolutionaries. The Zouaves, as they were known, were ultimately unsuccessful and the Papal States fell in 1870. A volunteer Belgian Legion fought alongside French forces in the Mexican Adventure from 1864 on behalf of Mexican Emperor Maximilian I, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> was the daughter of Leopold I. The unit suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Tacámbaro in 1865, and after heavy fighting was disbanded in December 1866.|$|E
5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E

5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Roman Empire {{recalled}} its legions from the province of Britannia in 410, parts of the island had already been settled by pagan Germanic tribes who, later in the century, appear to have taken control of Kent and other coastal regions. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory sent a group of missionaries to Kent to convert Æthelberht, King of Kent, <b>whose</b> <b>wife,</b> Bertha of Kent, was a Frankish princess and practising Christian. Augustine was the prior of Gregory's own monastery in Rome and Gregory prepared {{the way for the}} mission by soliciting aid from the Frankish rulers along Augustine's route.|$|E
5|$|Following Martin's departure, Trey Spruance {{was brought}} on {{to perform on}} the album, having also been in Mr. Bungle with singer Mike Patton.

5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> {{would have}} played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption is a Western action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rockstar San Diego {{and published by}} Rockstar Games.

40|$|The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), {{conducted}} in 1973 - 1982, provided {{a unique opportunity}} to study the effect of passive smoking on men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> smoke. MRFIT participants who reported at entry that they had never smoked tobacco products were classified according to the smoking status of their wives. Men with wives who smoked had similar mean levels of serum thiocyanate (54. 3 vs. 53. 9 mumol/liter, p = 0. 83) but higher mean levels of expired carbon monoxide (7. 7 vs. 7. 1 ppm, p = 0. 001). Lower levels of pulmonary function (by maximum forced expiratory volume in one second) were also observed in these men (3, 493. 1 vs. 3, 591. 9 ml, p = 0. 04). The relative risks, for men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> smoked compared with men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> did not smoke, for the endpoints coronary heart disease death, fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease event, and death from any cause were 2. 11 (p = 0. 19, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 69 - 6. 46), 1. 48 (p = 0. 13, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 2. 47), and 1. 96 (p = 0. 08, 95 % CI 0. 93 - 4. 11), respectively. When smokers who quit prior to entry were included in the analyses, the relative risks, for men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> smoked compared with men <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> did not smoke, for the above endpoints were 1. 45 (p = 0. 25, 95 % CI 0. 77 - 2. 73), 1. 19 (p = 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 85 - 1. 65), and 1. 72 (p = 0. 01, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 64), respectively. These relative risk estimates did not change appreciably after adjusting for other baseline risk factors. The results suggest that passive exposure to cigarette smoke may have a deleterious impact on the health of nonsmokers and that nonsmokers may be at an increased risk of death through passive exposure to cigarette smoke...|$|R
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, <b>whose</b> <b>wife,</b> daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was initially}} {{made up of}} only ten families but grew to include 50 members by 1878. By the time their second building was built in 1906, the congregation included 82 members, and Meridian as a whole had grown to include 525 Jewish residents by 1927. By the 2000s there were fewer than forty, mostly elderly Jews remaining in the city, however, and the congregation no longer has a full-time rabbi. Former rabbis include Judah Wechsler, after whom the Wechsler school was named, and William Ackerman, <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> Paula Ackerman {{became the first woman}} to perform rabbinical duties in the country after her husband's unexpected death.|$|E
5|$|While {{continuing}} with a slower work-rate, Lombard {{decided to move}} away from comedies and return to dramatic roles. She appeared in a second David O. Selznick production, Made for Each Other (1939), which paired her with James Stewart to play a couple facing domestic difficulties. Reviews for the film were highly positive, and praised Lombard's dramatic effort; financially, it was a disappointment. Lombard's next appearance came opposite Cary Grant in the John Cromwell romance In Name Only (1939), a credit she personally negotiated with RKO Radio Pictures upon hearing of the script and Grant's involvement. The role mirrored her recent experiences, as she played a woman in love with a married man <b>whose</b> <b>wife</b> refuses to divorce. She was paid $150,000 for the film, continuing her status as one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, and it was a moderate success.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} examine the effects of {{intimate}} marital relationships upon self-reported rearing styles towards a young child, 118 Japanese couples with at least one child were administered a set of questionnaires. A path analysis showed that <b>wives</b> <b>whose</b> husbands treated them with an affectionate attitude were more likely to hold affectionate child-rearing styles; <b>wives</b> <b>whose</b> husbands treated them with a controlling attitude were more likely to hold overprotective child-rearing styles; husbands <b>whose</b> <b>wives</b> acted in controlling ways towards them tended to exhibit less affectionate and more overprotective rearing child-rearing practices...|$|R
