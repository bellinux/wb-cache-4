Statistically, both teams always enjoyed {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is one of the {{smallest}} and least populated regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, {{as one of the most}} loyal in the country. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the <b>whole</b> <b>period</b> from 1967 to present day.|$|E
5|$|More detail for the <b>whole</b> <b>period</b> is {{provided}} by Plutarch, in his biographies of Themistocles, Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore a secondary source, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. In his biographies, he draws directly from many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that are omitted in Herodotus and Thucydides's accounts. The final major existing source for the period is the universal history (Bibliotheca historica) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus's writing about this period is drawn from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history. Diodorus is also a secondary source and often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.|$|E
5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the <b>whole</b> <b>period</b> from 1962 to present day.|$|E

40|$|An {{accounting}} system {{consists of a}} measurement unit and a valuation basis as the measurement element of accounting. There are four measurement units and four valuation bases. They derive many types of {{accounting system}} by combining these elements. These accounting systems can be classified into the system of historical cost accounting, entry value accounting, exit value accounting and present value accounting respectively. The measurement unit has functions to determine <b>whole</b> <b>periods</b> income and to maintain capital of a firm. The valuation basis has functions to distribute <b>whole</b> <b>periods</b> income to a specific period and to determine a time of income recognition. It {{is important to consider}} the accounting system on the whole. When setting up accounting standards, we should not set up them from a local standpoint, but overall and logical standpoint.

25|$|The sleep {{cycle of}} {{alternate}} NREM and REM sleep takes {{an average of}} 90 minutes, occurring 4–6 times in a good night's sleep.

The <b>whole</b> <b>period</b> normally proceeds in the order: N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. REM sleep occurs as a person returns to stage 2 or 1 from a deep sleep. There is a greater amount of deep sleep (stage N3) earlier in the night, while the proportion of REM sleep increases in the two cycles just before natural awakening.|$|E
