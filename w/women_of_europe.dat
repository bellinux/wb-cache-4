50|$|In 1345, she was betrothed to Peter of Castile, son of Alfonso XI of Castile and Maria of Portugal. A {{few years}} later, {{in the summer}} of 1348, Joan left England with the blessing of her parents. Thanks to a heavily armed retinue she was, perhaps, the most {{protected}} <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> at the time, and it is said that her trousseau alone required an entire ship. The travel schedule included a visit to one of her family's castles in Bordeaux.|$|R
60|$|Now {{as she sat}} {{before the}} fire in the same chair which had so {{recently}} been occupied by the Emperor, I had an opportunity of studying this person, whose strange fate had raised her from being the daughter of a lieutenant of artillery to the first position among the <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe.</b> She was six years older than Napoleon, and on this occasion, when I saw her first, she was in her forty-second year; but at a little distance or in a discreet light, it was no courtier's flattery to say that she might very well have passed for thirty. Her tall, elegant figure was girlish in its supple slimness, and she had an easy and natural grace in every movement, which she inherited with her tropical West Indian blood. Her features were delicate, and I have heard that in her youth she was strikingly beautiful; but, like most Creole women, she had become passee in early middle age. She had made a brave fight, however--with art as her ally--against the attacks of time, and her success had been such that when she sat aloof upon a dais or drove past in a procession, she might still pass as a lovely woman. In a small room, however, or in a good light, the crude pinks and whites with which she had concealed her sallow cheeks became painfully harsh and artificial. Her own natural beauty, however, still lingered in that last refuge of beauty--the eyes, which were large, dark, and sympathetic. Her mouth, too, was small and amiable, and her most frequent expression was a smile, which seldom broadened into a laugh, as she had her own reasons for preferring that her teeth should not be seen. As to her bearing, it was so dignified, that if this little West Indian had come straight from the loins of Charlemagne, it could not have been improved upon. Her walk, her glance, the sweep of her dress, the wave of her hand--they had all the happiest mixture of the sweetness of a woman and the condescension of a queen. I watched her with admiration as she leaned forward, picking little pieces of aromatic aloes wood out of the basket and throwing them on to the fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to explore medieval <b>women</b> mystics <b>of</b> <b>Europe.</b> In {{examining}} the works of these mystics, I will concentrate on two major writers. The first, from the 12 th century, is Hildegard von Bingen, the first major German mystic. Julian of Norwich, from the 14 th century, is the second writer and is titled as the first known woman writer in English literature. The goal of this discussion is to compare an early medieval, mystical writer (12 th c.) to a later writer (14 th c.). The fact {{that many people are}} not even aware of women's achievements as writers during this time period makes this exciting and necessary research. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
