5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern that this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the tacit {{approval of the}} Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the stage {{and that the only}} play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care is required not to destroy larger diamonds, and then sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes for the scenes involving the St Georges spyboat.

On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E

5|$|In January 1917, {{a second}} mounted division– the Imperial Mounted Division– was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from {{experience}} in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Chauvel's approval but was contrary to {{the policy of the}} Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E

5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of}} the projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

Like her book on bread, the scope for Ice and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of Wine was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E

One <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when the counsel found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with the counsel, in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 2001, during the original {{run of the}} Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A {{major part of the}} graphical design was adjusting the characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.|$|E

Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside {{for the use of the}} Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary Franklin Knight Lane was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior.
