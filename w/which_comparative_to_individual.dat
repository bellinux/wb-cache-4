Originally airing only on Sunday nights from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, Vault Disney expanded to seven nights a week in September 1998 (the Monday through Saturday editions of the block at this time aired from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern/Pacific; the start time of the block {{as a whole was}} moved uniformally to midnight daily in September 1999). The classic programming featured during the late night schedule changed to feature only Disney-produced television series and specials (such as Zorro, Spin and Marty, The Mickey Mouse Club and the Walt Disney anthology television series), along with older Disney television specials. Older Disney feature films also were part of the lineup from 1997 to 2000, but aired in a reduced capacity. The block also featured The Ink and Paint Club, an anthology series featuring classic Disney animated shorts, which became the only remaining program on the channel to feature these shorts by 1999, upon the removal of Quack Pack from the schedule. The channel discontinued the block in September 2002, in favor of running reruns of its original and acquired series during the late evening and overnight hours (<b>which</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>to</b> the adult-focused Vault Disney, are aired at children and teenagers, an audience that is typically asleep during that time period).|$|R

We first developed visual stimuli for four dimensions—size, clarity, complexity, and darkness—and in each case we varied the stimuli to express a range of the dimension (e. g., there were five total items expressing the range covering big, medium, and small). In our study, English- and Mandarin-speakers mapped these stimuli to an unlabelled vertical scale. Most people mapped dimensional endpoints in similar ways; using size as a standard, we found that the majority of participants mapped the clearest, most complex, and darkest items to the same end of the vertical scale as they mapped the biggest items. This indicates that all four dimensions have a weighted or unmarked end (i. e., all are directional or polar). The strong similarities in polarity across language groups contrasted with group differences on a lexical task, for which there was little cross-linguistic agreement about <b>which</b> <b>comparative</b> words <b>to</b> use to describe stimulus pairs (e. g., “bigger” vs. “smaller”).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of trade, both {{domestically}} as well as internationally, as a channel of technology transmission. A model is presented in which R&D investments towards product innovations trigger total factor productivity growth at the industry level. If the new products are exported to other industries, the return to the R&D investments does in part spill over to these industries. The model predicts that total factor productivity levels are positively related to both own-, and the domestic and foreign industry R&D investments of the trade partners. Using data on trade relations between OECD country sectors, effective R&D stocks are constructed which should pick up technology flows that are trade-related. The empirical results, <b>which</b> are <b>comparative</b> <b>to</b> a benchmark model where trade relations play no role, find generally only weak support for {{the notion that the}} transmission of technology is trade-related; more specifically, they point more towards domestic than to international trade.

40|$|Aim: To {{validate}} {{a previously}} developed prediction model for vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using a Japanese cohort. Methods: We performed a cohort study of all term pregnant {{women with a}} vertex position, singleton gestation, and one prior low transverse cesarean delivery attempting a trial of labor between April 1985 and March 2010. Variables necessary for the prediction of successful VBAC were maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, ethnicity, prior vaginal delivery, prior VBAC, and indication for prior cesarean delivery. They were extracted from medical records and put into the formula that calculates an individual woman's predicted VBAC success rate. The predicted rates were then partitioned into deciles and compared with the actual VBAC rates. The predictive ability of the model was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined. Results: Seven hundred and twenty-five women who met the inclusion criteria had complete data available, of which 664 (91. 6 %) had VBAC. The predicted probability of VBAC, as calculated by the regression equation, was significantly higher in those who had a successful trial of labor (median 80. 1 %, interquartile range 71. 5 - 88. 7) {{than those who did}} not (median 69. 4 %, interquartile range 59. 9 - 78. 9, P &# 60; 0. 001).

To accurately predict O-glycosylation sites, a new model has been developed with genetic algorithm to select crucial features among the large amount of amino acid properties encoded feature vectors[1]. 328 nonapeptides of O-glycosylation and 2855 of non-O-glycosylation sites, were retrieved from Swiss-Prot database. The peptides represented by 526 amino acid properties are transformed into a numeric vector with 4737 features. Based on the selected top 50 features with genetic algorithm, a predictive model was established with neural network method. The model exhibited a good predictability with a cross-validation accuracy of 80. 5 % for the whole set, and the accuracies were 81. 7 % and 68. 0 % for non-glycosylation and glycosylation sites respectively, <b>which</b> is <b>comparative</b> <b>to</b> the NetOGlyc 3. 1,one of useful O-glycosylation site predictors at present[2]. According to the features selected, we can conclude that the propeties of the 4 th and the 8 th amino acid of the nonapeptides contribute more to the glycosylation, and the accessibility of the 8 th amino acid impact most greatly. This model can not only be used as fast and accurate screener to identify the glycosylation sites of large protein darasets, but can determine the crucial amino acid properties contributing more to glycosylation. 国际药物代谢学...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a qualitative, comparative {{case study}} focusing on fundraising strategies used to increase alumni giving among {{the majority and}} the minority populations at a Historically Black Institution (HBI) and a Historically White Institution (HWI). For this study, the minority population at the HBI {{is defined as the}} Caucasian alumni and at the HWI the minority population is defined as the African American alumni. Both institutions are four year comprehensive Catholic institutions. When comparing both institutional types, the rate of alumni giving at historically white institutions is higher than within the black college context. ^ Scholars have conducted research on alumni giving based on the majority population, but limited research is available about black colleges and the strategies they use to increase alumni giving. Some researchers argue that fundraising strategies are not race-specific and can be applied to any culture while others suggest that fundraising success is dependent upon understanding the giving behavior within a specific community. Other researchers indicate that race-related motivations, unique educational experiences, and issues of trust are large factors that reflect giving in the black community. ^ This study provided <b>comparative</b> insight <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> affiliated with institutional advancement and alumni giving strategies. Specifically, results discussed herein will provide new strategies to increase alumni giving among institutional minority populations. In addition, this dissertation will help development professionals become more aware of the culture of giving within the African American community and it will add to the limited research on alumni giving at black colleges. ^ I found that the strategies used to increase alumni giving within these two institutional types were consistent. Additionally, the strategies used to increase alumni giving among the minority population were consistent with the majority population at both institutions. Ironically, when institutions used the same strategies with the minority population as they did with the majority population at both institutions, these strategies were not effective. Therefore, I concluded that development professionals should use culturally-sensitive strategies when soliciting the minority populations to increase alumni giving. ...|$|R

DNA-based methods of detection can circumvent many of the limitations of currently used screening methods, allowing a fast and accurate monitoring of samples. The genus Xanthomonas includes 13 phytopathogenic quarantine organisms for which improved methods of diagnosis are needed. In this work, we propose 21 new Xanthomonas-specific molecular markers, within loci coding for Xanthomonas-specific protein domains, useful for DNA-based methods of identification of xanthomonads. The specificity of these markers was assessed by a dot blot hybridization array using 23 non-Xanthomonas species, mostly soil dwelling and/or phytopathogens for the same host plants. In addition, the validation of these markers on 15 Xanthomonas spp. suggested species-specific hybridization patterns, which allowed discrimination among the different Xanthomonas species.
