6000|$|Yes, child.

Oh for Lady Why to cure that barbarism! Oh that Madam How would teach them that {{machinery}} must always be cheaper {{in the long run}} than human muscles and nerves! Oh that Lady Why would teach them that a woman is the most precious thing on earth, and that if she be turned into a beast of burden, Lady Why--and Madam How likewise--will surely avenge the wrongs of their human sister!" [...] There, you do not quite know what I mean, and I do not care that you should. It is good for little folk that big folk should now and then [...] "talk over their heads," [...] as the saying is, and make them feel how ignorant they are, and how many solemn and earnest questions there are in the world on which they must make up their minds some day, though not yet. But now we <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> hay: or rather do you and the rest go and play in the hay and gather it up, build forts of it, storm them, pull them down, build them up again, shout, laugh, and scream till you are hot and tired.

60|$|There is {{one thing}} which, in the {{presence}} of average modern journalism, is perhaps worth saying in connection with such an idle matter as this. The morals of a matter like this are exactly like the morals of anything else; they are concerned with mutual contract, or with the rights of independent human lives. But the whole modern world, or at any rate the whole modern Press, has a perpetual and consuming terror of plain morals. Men always attempt to avoid condemning a thing upon merely moral grounds. If I beat my grandmother to death to-morrow in the middle of Battersea Park, you may be perfectly certain that people will say everything about it except the simple and fairly obvious fact that it is wrong. Some will call it insane; that is, will accuse it of a deficiency of intelligence. This is not necessarily true at all. You could not tell whether the act was unintelligent or not unless you knew my grandmother. Some will call it vulgar, disgusting, and the rest of it; that is, they will accuse it of a lack of manners. Perhaps it does show a lack of manners; but this is scarcely its most serious disadvantage. Others <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loathsome spectacle and the revolting scene; that is, they will accuse it of a deficiency of art, or æsthetic beauty. This again depends on the circumstances: in order to be quite certain that the appearance of the old lady has definitely deteriorated under the process of being beaten to death, it is necessary for the philosophical critic to be quite certain how ugly she was before. Another school of thinkers will say that the action is lacking in efficiency: that it is an uneconomic waste of a good grandmother. But that could only depend on the value, which is again an individual matter. The only real point that is worth mentioning is that the action is wicked, because your grandmother has a right not to be beaten to death. But of this simple moral explanation modern journalism has, as I say, a standing fear. It will call the action anything else--mad, bestial, vulgar, idiotic, rather than call it sinful.|$|E
40|$|More than 2200 {{scientists}} {{coming from}} 37 countries {{participate in the}} ATLAS experiment. Only 17 % of these are women. Why is this so?

I will address this difference as well as examine {{the role of women in}} the ATLAS collaboration. I <b>will</b> also <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> activities of the ATLAS Women's Network, of which Prof. Engin Arik was a founding member.

6000|$|Later we laid our bones down to {{crossing}} the Rockies. An American train can {{climb up the}} side of a house if need be, but it is not pleasant to sit in it. We clomb till we struck violent cold and an Indian reservation, and the noble savage came to look at us. He was a Flathead and unlovely. Most Americans are charmingly frank about the Indian. [...] "Let us get rid of him as soon as possible," [...] they say. [...] "We have no use for him." [...] Some of the men I meet have a notion that we in India are exterminating the native in the same fashion, and I have been asked to fix a date for the final extinguishment of the Aryan. I answer {{that it will be a}} long business. Very many Americans have an offensive habit of referring to natives as [...] "heathen." [...] Mahometans and Hindus are heathen alike in their eyes, and they vary the epithet with [...] "pagan" [...] and [...] "idolater." [...] But this is beside the matter, which is the Stampede Tunnel--our actual point of {{crossing the}} Rockies. Thank Heaven, I need never take that tunnel again! It is about two miles long, and in effect is nothing more than the gallery of a mine shored with timber and lighted with electric lamps. Black darkness would be preferable, for the lamps just reveal the rough cutting of the rocks, and that is very rough indeed. The train crawls through, brakes down, and you can hear the water and little bits of stone falling on the roof of the car. Then you pray, pray fervently, and the air gets stiller and stiller, and you dare not take your unwilling eyes off the timber shoring, lest a prop should fall, for lack of your moral support. Before the tunnel was built you crossed in the open air by a switchback line. A watchman goes through the tunnel after each train, but that is no protection. He just guesses that another train will pull through, and the engine-driver guesses the same thing. Some day between the two of them there will be a cave in the tunnel. Then the enterprising reporter <b>will</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shrieks and groans of the buried and the heroic efforts of the Press in securing first information, and--that will be all. Human life is of small account out here.|$|E
