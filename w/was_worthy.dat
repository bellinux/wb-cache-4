5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{schoolchildren}} from Canton, Massachusetts {{decided that}} the book <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of being the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{shocked and}} dejected, {{returned}} to the palace since he had already anointed his son, Devavrata, as heir apparent. Devavrata was distressed by his father's condition; he learned about the promise asked by the fisherman-chief from a minister. Immediately, Devavrata rushed to the hut of the fisherman-chief and begged for Satyvati's hand on his father's behalf. The fisherman repeated his condition and told Devavrata that only Shantanu <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of Satyavati; he had rejected marriage proposals from even Brahmarishis like Asita.|$|E

5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|Brown, Barnes and Morris {{shared the}} opening duties against the visiting Indians; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian {{selectors}} dropped Barnes {{for the first}} two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 runsAustralia batted once in both Testsand was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morriswhose place was securewas rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance to show that he <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 40 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wifestill living in Scotlandbefore he was confirmed. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.|$|E
5|$|During the Australian {{season of}} 194748, which preceded {{the tour of}} England, Morris played {{in the first four}} Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the {{selectors}} wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 40. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance to show that he <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of selection.

25|$|Churchill first {{sought the}} opinion of friends and {{relations}} about the book. He asked his grandmother, Frances, Duchess of Marlborough, to comment, with particular reference {{to the character of}} Lucile. She responded that she felt the book <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of publication, particularly since it already had the prospect of a reasonable financial return, but felt the plot might be improved. She was impressed by the descriptions of fighting, but agreed with Churchill's concerns about Lucile, suggesting that the character betrayed his lack of experience of women. However, an offer of £100 from the Morning Post for the right to serialise the book left Churchill no time for amendments, and it was published as it stood.|$|E

Merida then thanked Mulan and Ruby for helping her, with Ruby and Mulan decide to team up together to find other werewolves. Merida then uses the spell at her father's grave and his spirit appears to her, telling Merida that he was proud of her. After King Fergus' spirit disappears, Merida vows to make Arthur pay.|$|E

In his first issue, Cabezas point out that opposition is the stand stone for a republican government and that, provided his newspaper reach its tenth issue, Barillas would have demonstrated he <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> of having the Constitution modified to allow him run as president, even though he was the interim. Cabeza was expelled from Guatemala after only three issues of El Pueblo, and Barillas modified the Constitution and became president for the 1886–1892 term.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and firing point blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire.

25|$|A brief {{notice on}} Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian {{specialist}} Émile Cartailhac, {{a member of}} the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Société archéologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyrenées. Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction of Boudet's book to the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism {{went so far as to}} say that Boudet's study <b>was</b> <b>worthy</b> at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch.|$|E
