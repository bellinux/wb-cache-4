60|$|Madeline had {{not time}} {{to grasp the}} sense of his last words. Stewart had convulsively sprung upward, white as chalk. As he leaped at Hawe Stillwell {{interposed}} his huge bulk and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Stewart. There was a brief, whirling, wrestling struggle. Stewart appeared to be besting the old cattleman.|$|E
60|$|He laid {{hold of her}} {{arm with}} rude, {{powerful}} clutch. One pull drew her sliding half {{out of the saddle}} into his arms. She fell with her breast against his, not wholly free of stirrups or horse, and there she hung, utterly powerless. Maddened, writhing, she tore to release herself. All she could accomplish was to twist herself, raise herself high enough to see his face. That almost paralyzed her. Did he mean to kill her? Then he <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her and crushed her tighter, closer to him. She felt the pound of his heart; her own seemed to have frozen. Then he pressed his burning lips to hers. It was a long, terrible kiss. She felt him shake.|$|E
50|$|According to the Swedish tradition, {{when the}} man (a monk) {{returned}} and said the name, Jätten Finn became angry and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> a pillar in order {{to pull it out}} and destroy the cathedral. But at that moment he was turned into stone, and that is why there is a stone man hugging a pillar in the Lund Cathedral this day. Another theory is that the carving represents the biblical figure Samson, who sacrificed himself by toppling the pillars of a Philistine temple.|$|E

50|$|Malignaggi took on Danny García at Barclays Center, Brooklyn, August 1, 2015. It was Malignaggi's {{first step}} up to fight at 147 lbs. Malignaggi was cut above his right eye by the third and had a large welt beneath the right eye by the sixth.

Garcia was awarded a technical knockout.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Jones {{was back}} in the {{starting}} lineup when Pittsburgh rolled into Cleveland for a game with their biggest rivals, the Browns. Although Hal Lebovitz called it Jones' best game {{at the end of the}} third quarter, Jones' legacy as the instigator in one of the dirtiest plays in recent memory was made in the 4th. Jones lined up for a play, beat the offensive lineman (Larry Brown) and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Whistles blew, but Jones ignored them and lifted Bradshaw up high, and slammed the Pittsburgh QB on his head. As Bradshaw laid there motionless on the ground, the officials marched off a 15-yard penalty for roughing. Bradshaw ended up with a concussion, and Jones ended up with a $3,000 fine.|$|E
50|$|Troiani, at {{the engine}} control signals fared better, being hurled into soft snow and rolling before {{immediately}} jumping {{to his feet}} and cleaning the snow off his glasses, which had survived the crash unscathed. Viglieri and Mariano, standing next to the chart table, briefly saw the rear engine car about to strike the ice hard and then found themselves prostrate but unharmed in a mass of debris. Biagi, with no time to send out an SOS grabbed the portable emergency radio and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> it trying to save it from damage. The impact on the ice winded him but left him inside the wreck of the cabin. Nobile lay unconscious with a head wound, with Malmgren and Zappi nearby.|$|E

The maneuver results in the opponent's neck or back to be slammed against the wrestler's knee.|$|R

40|$|Colin Myers first {{slept with}} his {{neighbor}} {{four days after}} his eighteenth birthday, but he 2 ̆ 7 d wanted Wanda Mitchell for two long summers.

They had not been caught, no close calls, but like adrenaline after a car accident, the possibility lingered...|$|R

50|$|It is {{used when}} the player {{carrying}} {{the ball is}} running at speed and a defending player is approaching from behind. Even if the defender {{is not able to}} get close enough to the ball-carrier to <b>wrap</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him in a conventional tackle, he may still be able to dive at the other player's feet and, with an outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble. At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down.|$|R
50|$|Innovated by Jun Akiyama, {{and also}} called a T-bone suplex (named by former wrestler Tazz), the {{attacker}} stands facing his opponent and positions himself {{under one of}} the opponent's <b>arms</b> and <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the opponent's neck and back (this position {{is similar to that of}} a side slam) and then grabs the waist or leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head.
