5|$|After {{the season}} began, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, {{but the same}} number of storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU's final prediction on October1.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Baker {{graduated}} from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, {{and finished with}} above-average grades. He was named the school's best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete {{and the man who}} had done the most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker's three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost to Yale.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had maintained his previous prediction; with an active {{start of the}} season, {{the rest of the}} season was forecast to have been only slightly above average, due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the Atlantic Ocean. A day later, NOAA released an updated prediction as <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 60% probability of above normal activity, with 12–15 named storms, 7–9 hurricanes, and 3–4 major hurricanes expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} made on a {{production}} budget of about $15 million and shot {{in various parts of}} Los Angeles, California, beginning on September 25, 2010. Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints. Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit or drive at night. Refn asked that the editing suite be placed in his home as <b>well.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the first round; Somerset faced first-class opposition {{in each of the}} four rounds prior to the final. In their semi-final match against Essex, Somerset only progressed as they had lost fewer wickets in a tied match. Sussex played against minor counties in each of the first two rounds, but only beat Staffordshire by two runs to advance from the second round, before more straightforward victories against first-class opposition in the later stages. Somerset batted first, but with the exception of Ian Botham, the batsmen struggled to score runs fluently. They scored 207 runs for 7 wickets, of which Botham scored 80 and Viv Richards 44. Sussex began their run-chase <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first-wicket partnership of 93, before losing four wickets in quick succession. A second partnership, between Paul Parker and Paul Phillipson led Sussex to victory by five wickets, chasing down Somerset's total with more than six overs to spare. Parker was named as the man of the match for his score of 62 not out.|$|E
5|$|For UEFA Euro 1976, England {{were drawn}} {{in a tough}} {{qualification}} group including Czechoslovakia, Portugal and Cyprus, with only the winner progressing to the finals. England began the campaign <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However a 0–0 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5–0 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2–0 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus, and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5–1 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974–75 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2–1 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1–1 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. Czechoslovakia {{then went on to}} win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position also drew criticism.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 season, Reutemann {{took the}} first three {{victories}} of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive BT44s. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the 1975 title. The year started <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first win for Brazilian driver Carlos Pace at the Interlagos circuit in his native São Paulo. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races. Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the 1975 German Grand Prix, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

The following season started <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were third in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United. However league form began to slip and Palace went six games without scoring immediately prior to the match at Old Trafford. Entering the tie as the underdogs, a 35-yard free-kick from Darren Ambrose and an extra time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford for the first time in 22 years. The club then announced potential plans to update the image of the club through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained patchy, and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff. Palace finished the season in seventeenth place, an improvement on the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} moved westward under the {{influence}} of a strong subtropical ridge to the south. Despite having reached tropical cyclone intensity according to Perth TCWC, it was not assigned a name. Once the storm crossed 90°E on March25, the Météo-France's La Réunion Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (MFR) began tracking the system as a moderate tropical storm, giving it the name Hudah. Gradually intensifying, Hudah developed an eye with an eyewall primarily in the northern semicircle, indicated by a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass over the system. On March26, Hudah ceased strengthening as cloud tops warmed and the eye became no longer evident. Atmospheric divergence remained favorable, and Hudah eventually restrengthened, attaining tropical cyclone intensity at 0000UTC on March27, while located approximately 1,200km (750mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. This period of strengthening was short-lived, likely due to dry air. The cloud structure fluctuated as <b>well,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poorly-defined eye appearing at times on satellite imagery. Hudah was able to attain an initial peak intensity of 155km/h (95mph) at 0600UTC on March29 according to the MFR, shortly after passing 1010km (630mi) south of Diego Garcia. An anticyclone that had been over Hudah showed signs of weakening later that day, spurring an increase in wind shear and causing weakening. This period of weakening was short-lived, and Hudah resumed its former strengthening trend by the night of March30 as shear decreased and convective organization and areal extent increased. After passing 275km (170mi) north of Rodrigues Island, Hudah attained intense tropical cyclone status by 1200UTC on March31. Satellite imagery indicated a large, cloud-free eye, indicative of a strong tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E

He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
