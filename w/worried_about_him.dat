5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

This had to be paid within four weeks or he would have to serve an extra 150 days of hard labour.|$|E

25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E
500|$|In 1951, an edited volume, Aspects of Archaeology in Britain and Beyond: Essays Presented to O. G. S. Crawford, was published, {{having been}} edited by Grimes {{and brought out}} to mark Crawford's 65th birthday. Reviewing the {{anthology}} for Antiquity, J. v. d. Waals and R. J. Forbes described it as [...] "an exquisite birthday present". Many of Crawford's associates <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> aware that he lived alone at his cottage in Nursling—with only the company of his elderly housekeeper and cats—and that he lacked either a car or telephone. It was there that he died in his sleep {{on the night of}} 28–29 November 1957. He had arranged for some of his letters and books to be destroyed, while others were to be sent to the Bodleian Library, with the proviso that some of them would not be opened until the year 2000. His body was buried in the church graveyard at Nursling. In accordance with his instructions, the title [...] "Editor of Antiquity" [...] was inscribed on his gravestone, reflecting his desire to be remembered primarily as an archaeologist. On Crawford's death, the editorship of Antiquity was taken on by Daniel.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E

2500|$|Brian {{believed}} {{the band was}} <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> separating from the group, elaborating that [...] "it was generally considered that the Beach Boys were the main thing... with Pet Sounds, there was a resistance in that I was {{doing most of the}} artistic work on it vocally". Love wrote: [...] "I also {{would have liked to have}} had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with." [...] The conflicts were resolved, according to Brian, [...] " [...] they figured that it was a showcase for Brian Wilson, but it's still the Beach Boys. In other words, they gave in. They let me have my little stint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, the {{government}} did, indeed, worry about Nathaniel Mist, and they <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{so much that}} they put Daniel Defoe in his employ to be his friend and spy on him, write for him, and persuade him away from the most damaging articles. [...] In 1718, Daniel Defoe claimed that he had personally spiked stories that Mist would have published and that Mist was under his control. [...] Although this was almost certainly an exaggeration, Defoe said later that he had gotten Mist out of jail on at least three occasions. [...] When Defoe left off working with Mist entirely in 1724, he complained in Applebee's Journal that Mist had fought with him (physically) and insulted him, and in 1730 he complained that Mist had harmed his career (probably by revealing Defoe's acting as a government agent to other printers).|$|E

2500|$|By this time, Katz {{had spent}} six years researching the life of {{theoretical}} physicist Albert Einstein, {{the last two years}} being a collaboration with Dr. Edward Ritvo. In their research, Katz and Ritvo discovered that Einstein's parents had been very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> when he was a baby. Born with an unusually large head similarly to many children with autism, Einstein's grandparents thought he was a dolt, in part because he was a late talker and did poorly in school. Einstein additionally [...] "was a loner, solitary, suffered from major tantrums, had no friends and didn't like being in crowds." [...] In 1995, Katz and Ritvo published their 1995 book, In a World of His Own: A Storybook About Albert Einstein. In In a World of His Own, Katz and Ritvo review the life of Albert Einstein in view of the features of the autistic spectrum to conclude that Einstein did have autism.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Riggan {{wakes up}} in {{hospital}} with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. His ex-wife is <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt [...] "super-realism" [...] and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes {{a picture of him}} to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below the open window before she slowly looks up into the sky, smiles, and laughs.|$|E
2500|$|Midway through filming, Zamora's health {{suddenly}} declined. Producer Jon Murray states, [...] "He {{got sick}} {{much faster than}} he expected. That's when he made us promise {{to tell his story}} till the end." [...] Also complicating Zamora's time in the Real World house was his conflict with housemate Rainey, which began early on in their stay there. In addition to the various personality traits of Rainey's with which all the roommates took issue, Rainey mocked Zamora's Cuban accent, denigrated his career as an educator, and made aforementioned gay-related jokes that offended Zamora. Winick described Rainey as [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "homophobic", and Zamora, feeling that the stress of his confrontations with Rainey was contributing to his deteriorating health, announced he would move out. The entire cast voted instead to evict Rainey from the house. Zamora's health continued to deteriorate, however, and he suffered night sweats, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and weight loss, and slept more frequently. Although he was able to participate in activities like parasailing during the group’s trip to Hawaii, the cast grew more <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> nonetheless, often covering up for him during their weekly [...] "confessional" [...] interviews with the producers by telling them that Zamora was doing fine when they knew otherwise.|$|E
