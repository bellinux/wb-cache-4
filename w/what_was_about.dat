5|$|The {{plan that}} the Union {{officers}} devised was called Moss 3, {{named after the}} Pittston’s Moss 3 Preparation Plant which was its primary coal processing plant at the time. The officials were very secretive about planning this act of nonviolent strike. They wanted Pittston to know nothing about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to take place. Officials selected 99 union members out of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky to participate in Moss 3 and the selected miners met in Virginia and were told about the plan.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{four days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of the film, a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

By then they had no doubt <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to occur and the Grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.|$|E

On 15 June Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky, the {{engineer}} who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to happen to them. Vrba concluded that the report had been suppressed.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers.

Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations.

Marc Cieslak of BBC News was saddened by the level, as he felt it disproved his theory that the video game industry had [...] "grown up". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kieron Gillen chastised the level for failing {{to live up to}} expectations. He found the plot to be illogical, criticized the skip feature for rendering an artistic statement as [...] "laughably pathetic", and ultimately summarized the level as [...] "dumb shock". Writing for PC World, Matt Peckham questioned why the gunmen would not care if the player did not shoot, and felt that not informing the player of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to happen until the last possible moment was [...] "creating a kind of plausible emotional deniability by removing all the dramatic impetus that ought to surround it". Several prominent British religious leaders condemned [...] "No Russian": Alexander Goldberg of the London Jewish Forum was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the British Muslim Forum described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and Stephen Lowe, the retired Bishop of Hulme, felt that the level was [...] "sickening".|$|E

[...] "I felt his anger at my camera, at me," [...] Karen Ballard recalled, [...] "and actually thought he might spit on me. He didn't know exactly <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to happen and, suddenly, the formerly fierce dictator seemed small and disheveled."

2500|$|Helen Macfarlane's {{writings}} show {{an acute}} knowledge of Chartist affairs and international politics, {{written in a}} punchy, at times knockabout style, expressive of proletarian anger.

Her writings are full of literary references (to Homer, Sophocles, Cervantes, Milton, and Heinrich Heine) and show not only a thorough grasp of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to become known as Marxism, but also a familiarity with what later Marxists, such as Althusser, tried to [...] "drive back into the night," [...] namely the Hegelian dialectic. Black argues that historians of philosophy have ignored her role as the first British commentator on, and translator of, the writing of G.W.F. Hegel.|$|E
