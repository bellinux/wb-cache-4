The ultraviolet light is then absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the lamp, causing it to glow, or fluoresce. Conventional linear fluorescent lamps have life spans around 20,000 and 30,000 hours based on 3 hours per cycle according to lamps NLPIP reviewed in 2006. Induction fluorescent relies on electromagnetism rather than the cathodes used to start conventional linear fluorescent. The newer rare earth triphosphor blend linear fluorescent lamps made by Osram, Philips, Crompton and others have a life expectancy greater than 40,000 hours, if coupled with a <b>warm-start</b> electronic ballast. The life expectancy depends {{on the number of}} on/off cycles, and is lower if the light is cycled often. The ballast-lamp combined system efficacy for then current linear fluorescent systems in 1998 as tested by NLPIP ranged from 80 to 90 lm/W.|$|E

40|$|We {{implement}} several <b>warm-start</b> {{strategies in}} interior-point methods for linear programming (LP). We study {{the situation in}} which both the original LP instance and the perturbed one have exactly the same dimensions. We consider different types of perturbations of data components of the original instance and different sizes of each type of perturbation. We modify the state-of-the-art interior-point solver PCx in our implementation. We evaluate the effectiveness of each <b>warm-start</b> strategy {{based on the number of}} iterations and the computation time in comparison with "cold start" on the NETLIB test suite. Our experiments reveal that each of the <b>warm-start</b> strategies leads to a reduction in the number of interior-point iterations especially for smaller perturbations and for perturbations of fewer data components in comparison with cold start. On the other hand, only one of the <b>warm-start</b> strategies exhibits better performance than cold start in terms of computation time. Based on the insight gained from the computational results, we discuss several potential improvements to enhance the performances of such <b>warm-start</b> strategies.

40|$|An {{important}} {{advantage of}} infeasible interior-point methods compared to feasible interior-point methods is {{their ability to}} be <b>warm-started</b> from approximate solutions. It is therefore important for the convergence theory of these algorithms not to depend {{on being able to}} alter the starting point. In two recent papers, Yin Zhang and Stephen Wright prove convergence results for some infeasible interior-point methods. Unfortunately, their analysis places a restriction on the starting point. It is easy to meet the restriction by altering the starting point, but this may take the point farther away from the solution, removing the advantage of <b>warm-starting</b> the algorithms. In this paper we extend Zhang and Wright's results to apply to arbitrary strictly positive starting points. We then present an algorithm for solving the Box-Constrained Linear Complementarity problem and prove its convergence. 1 Introduction Quite often, in using an iterative method to solve a problem, it is possible to u [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{approaches}} {{based on}} operator splitting are becoming popular for solving sparsity regularized statistical machine learning models. While many have proposed fast algorithms {{to solve these}} problems for a single regularization parameter, conspicuously less {{attention has been given}} to computing regularization paths, or solving the optimization problems over the full range of regularization parameters to obtain a sequence of sparse models. In this chapter, we aim to quickly approximate the sequence of sparse models associated with regularization paths for the purposes of statistical model selection by using the building blocks from a classical operator splitting method, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We begin by proposing an ADMM algorithm that uses <b>warm-starts</b> to quickly compute the regularization path. Then, by employing approximations along this <b>warm-starting</b> ADMM algorithm, we propose a novel concept that we term the ADMM Algorithmic Regularization Path. Our method can quickly outline the sequence of sparse models associated with the regularization path in computational time that is often less than that of using the ADMM algorithm to solve the problem at a single regularization parameter. We demonstrate the applicability and substantial computational savings of our approach through three popular examples, sparse linear regression, reduced-rank multi-task learning, and convex clustering.

In the logistic variant, the LogitBoost algorithm is used to produce an LR model at every node in the tree; the node is then split using the C4.5 criterion. Each LogitBoost invocation is <b>warm-started</b> from its results in the parent node. Finally, the tree is pruned.|$|R

We prove that, like the PAV algorithm, our PDAS algorithm for IR is convergent and has a work complexity of O(n), though our numerical experiments suggest that our PDAS algorithm is often faster than PAV.

40|$|Many {{sequential}} mathematical optimization {{methods and}} simulation-based heuristics for optimal control {{and design of}} water distribution networks rely on {{a large number of}} hydraulic simulations. In this paper, we propose an efficient inexact subspace Newton method for hydraulic analysis of water distribution networks. By using sparse and well-conditioned fundamental null space bases, we solve the nonlinear system of hydraulic equations in a lower-dimensional kernel space of the network incidence matrix. In the inexact framework, the Newton steps are determined by solving the Newton equations only approximately using an iterative linear solver. Since large water network models are inherently badly scaled, a Jacobian regularization is employed to improve the condition number of these linear systems and guarantee positive definiteness. After presenting a convergence analysis of the regularised inexact Newton method, we use the conjugate gradient (CG) method to solve the sparse reduced Newton linear systems. Since CG is not effective without good preconditioners, we propose tailored constraint preconditioners that are computationally cheap because they are based only on invariant properties of the null space linear systems and do not change with flows and pressures. The preconditioners are shown to improve the distribution of eigenvalues of the linear systems and so enable a more efficient use of the CG solver. Since contiguous Newton iterates can have similar solutions, each CG call is <b>warm-started</b> with the solution for a previous Newton iterate to accelerate its convergence rate. Operational network models are used to show the efficacy of the proposed preconditioners and the <b>warm-starting</b> strategy in reducing computational effort...|$|R

We provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm and connections to existing literature. We present numerical illustrations on real-life problems of electricity generation under uncertainty.

40|$|Abstract. Interior point methods (IPM) {{have been}} {{recognised}} as an efficient approach for {{the solution of}} large scale stochastic programming problems due to their ability of exploiting the block-angular structure of the augmented system particular to this problem class. Stochastic programming problems, however, have exploitable structure beyond the simple matrix shape: namely the scenarios are typically a discrete sampling of an underlying (continuous) probability distribution. An appealing way of exploiting this would be to initially use a coarser discretisation, i. e. less scenarios, to obtain an approximate solution, which could then be used to <b>warm-start</b> the solver on the full problem. In this paper we present a multi-step <b>warm-start</b> scheme for stochastic programming problems, where a sequence of problems defined over scenario trees of differing sizes is given and an IPM <b>warm-start</b> point is constructed by successively finding approximations to the central path of the problems defined over the given trees. We analyse the resulting algorithm, argue that it yields improved complexity over either the coldstart or a naive two-step scheme, and give numerical results...|$|E

As opposed to existing algorithmic approaches to NLP, the approach provides all the features required for scalability: it can efficiently detect and exploit directions of negative curvature, it is superlinearly convergent, and it enables the scalable computation of the Newton step through iterative linear algebra. Moreover, it presents features that are desirable for parametric optimization problems {{that have to be}} solved in a latency-limited environment, as is the case for model predictive control and mixed-integer nonlinear programming.

30|$|Current {{automatic}} {{speech recognition}} (ASR) systems achieve over 90 â 95 % accuracy, depending on the methodology applied and datasets used. However, the level of accuracy decreases significantly when the same ASR system is used by a non-native speaker of the language to be recognized. At the same time, the volume of labeled datasets of non-native speech samples is extremely limited both in size and {{in the number of}} existing languages. This problem makes it difficult to train or build sufficiently accurate ASR systems targeted at non-native speakers, which, consequently, calls for a different approach that would make use of vast amounts of large unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we address this issue by employing dual supervised learning (DSL) and reinforcement learning with policy gradient methodology. We tested DSL in a <b>warm-start</b> approach, with two models trained beforehand, and in a semi <b>warm-start</b> approach with only one of the two models pre-trained.

Using this continuous interpretation we derive two new methods to scale CNNs with respect to two different dimensions. The first class of multiscale methods connects low-resolution and high-resolution data through prolongation and restriction of CNN parameters. We demonstrate that this enables classifying high-resolution images using CNNs trained with low-resolution images and vice versa and <b>warm-starting</b> the learning process.
