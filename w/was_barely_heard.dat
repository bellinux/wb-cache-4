60|$|The half-hour that succeeded was awfully solemn and still. The {{moccasin}} of Pathfinder <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> <b>heard</b> overhead, {{and occasionally}} {{the sound of}} the breech of a rifle fell upon the floor, for he was busied in examining the pieces, with a view to ascertain the state of their charges and their primings. Beyond this, nothing was so loud as the breathing of the wounded man. Mabel's heart yearned to be in communication with the father she was so soon to lose, and yet she would not disturb his apparent repose. But Dunham slept not; he was in that state when the world suddenly loses its attractions, its illusions, and its power; and the unknown future fills the mind with its conjectures, its revelations, and its immensity. He had been a moral man for one of his mode of life, but he had thought little of this all-important moment. Had the din of battle been ringing in his ears, his martial ardor might have endured to the end; but there, in the silence of that nearly untenanted blockhouse, with no sound to enliven him, no appeal to keep alive factitious sentiment, no hope of victory to impel, things began to appear in their true colors, and this state of being to be estimated at its just value. He would have given treasures for religious consolation, and yet he knew not where to turn to seek it. He thought of Pathfinder, but he distrusted his knowledge. He thought of Mabel, but for the parent to appeal to the child for such succor appeared like reversing the order of nature. Then it was that he felt the full responsibility of the parental character, and had some clear glimpse of the manner in which he himself had discharged the trust towards an orphan child. While thoughts like these were rising in his mind, Mabel, who watched the slightest change in his breathing, heard a guarded knock at the door. Supposing it might be Chingachgook, she rose, undid two of the bars, and held the third in her hand, as she asked who was there. The answer was in her uncle's voice, and he implored her to give him instant admission. Without an instant of hesitation, she turned the bar, and Cap entered. He had barely passed the opening, when Mabel closed the door again, and secured it as before, for practice had rendered her expert in this portion of her duties.|$|E

5000|$|KSSU {{was started}} in 1989, but was {{originally}} known as [...] "The Edge". Another radio station of that name provided KSSU with a cease and desist letter in 1993, forcing the small station to change its identity to [...] "The Apex". The station changed frequencies several times before settling at 1580 AM, and was {{run out of the}} campus library. At that time, the station <b>was</b> <b>barely</b> <b>heard</b> in the campus dorms and stadium parking lot, but the signal was so weak, most DJs frequently played when they were the only listeners. A petition was signed to obtain the frequency of Capital Public Radio (also funded by CSUS but not student-run), and efforts were later made to get a larger signal, though they proved fruitless. DJs at the time were given free rein to say whatever they wanted and play whatever they decided, since nobody was really listening. The station eventually moved to the Union after its expansion, but the signal strength remained unchanged. This was noteworthy for the legal and administrative roadblocks, which prevented a great station from going on the airwaves with a stronger signal; for instance to 35 watts on FM. In the spring of 2005, the CSUS administration essentially blocked advancement of KSSU (from the dominance of its Capital Public Radio), and put forth a plan for the online signal, via its website.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Tonino Guerra in 1979, Tarkovsky said that he wanted [...] "music that {{is more or less}} popular, that expresses the movement of the masses, the theme of humanity's social destiny." [...] He added, [...] "But this music must <b>be</b> <b>barely</b> <b>heard</b> beneath the noise, {{in a way that the}} spectator is not aware of it." [...] In one scene, the sound of a train becomes more and more distant as the sounds of a house, such as the creaking floor, water running through pipes, and the humming of a heater become more prominent in a way that psychologically shifts the audience. While the Stalker leaves his house and wanders around an industrial landscape, the audience hears industrial sounds such as train whistles, ship foghorns, and train wheels. When the Stalker, the Writer, and the Professor set off from the bar in an off-road vehicle, the engine noise merges into an electronic tone. The natural sound of the engine falls off as the vehicle reaches the horizon. Initially almost inaudible, the electronic tone emerges and replaces the engine sound as if time has frozen.|$|R

Opetuksen toteuttaminen ja opiskelu vieraalla kielellä on haasteellista, mutta myös kiinnostavaa niin opettajan kuin oppijankin näkökulmasta. Oppisisällön opiskelu ja vieraan kielen käyttäminen samanaikaisesti tuo opiskeluun kaksoishyödyn. -Siinä lyödään kaksi kärpästä yhdellä iskulla, opitaan sisältöjä ja harjoitellaan vierasta kieltä yhtä aikaa, toteaa eräs Rasisen tutkimuksen haastateltavista. Rasinen haastatteli tutkimuksessaan oppilaita, opettajia, oppilaan vanhempaa sekä opettajaksi opiskelevaa. Kokemukset vieraalla kielellä opiskelusta olivat pääosin myönteisiä. Niin äidinkielen kuin englannin kielen kiinteää kuulumista oppilaan arkeen pidettiin arvokkaana ja hyödyllisenä. Vieraskielistä opetusta ei haastateltavien mielestä tule pitää vain tietyn oppilasjoukon etuoikeutena, vaan sen tulee olla erilaisten oppijoiden ulottuvilla. Oppilaan tavalliseen kouluarkeen kuuluvien vieraan kielen harjoittamisen tilanteiden koettiin hyödyntävän niin lahjakkaita kuin heikompiakin oppilaita. Perspectives on Content and Language Integrated Learning. The Impact of a Development Project on a School’s Activities. Content and {{language}} integrated learning (CLIL) {{has become an}} increasingly popular method in Finland. A {{number of studies have}} introduced the success of language immersion practises but the number of CLIL studies in Europe is still relatively small. According to previous research, the advantages of having a foreign language as a medium in teaching the contents of school subjects are obvious. However the teachers', pupils' and parents' - the users' - voices <b>are</b> <b>barely</b> <b>heard</b> in those studies. The CLIL-users' voices have been captured in the present study. This study attempts to describe one model of using the CLIL method at the primary school level. The CLIL instruction is described and evaluated by those who have experienced the approach. The analysed qualitative data in the case study offer ideas and observations regarding learning through a foreign language. The learning process, the elements of high quality teaching, the meaning of foreign language competence, the challenging way of studying and developing an individual school were the topics that constructed the horizon of meanings in the data analysis. One of the crucial educational issues in contemporary Europe has been the question of increasing the efficiency of language learning and teaching. According to {{the findings of this study}} teacher education and in- service education should offer teachers a wide range of tools for working with a foreign language so that teaching would be demonstrative and flexible. Teachers' willingness for co-operation would lead into the integration of contents and that would be an important aspect of the holistic approach to the learner. All the perspectives offered by the informants in this study give information about being open for content {{and language}} integrated learning. Studying content through a foreign language gives learners an opportunity to obtain a dual focus. Content and language integrated teaching and learning is demanding, but with unprejudiced attitudes and highly educated teaching personnel schools could respond to the demands of increasing the efficiency and plurality of language teaching targeting to the MT+ 2 (mother tongue + 2 languages) competence...|$|R

WBRB, having been in financial difficulty for some time, fell silent in 1989. Attempts to find a buyer for the bankrupt station proved futile, and that station was silenced for good after competitor Walter Wolpin (who owned WCAR in Livonia) purchased the license and assets in a 1992 bankruptcy court sale, returning the license to the FCC, with its towers being dismantled the following year, and the razing of its studio building not long after that. After WBRB went off the air, WFOB's signal, no longer inhibited by WBRB, could be heard clearly in the Detroit Metropolitan Area except where adjacent channel interference from AM 1440 WMKM in the Detroit suburb of Inkster was too great.|$|R
