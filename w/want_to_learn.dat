5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E

25|$|In Chinese, {{many more}} {{characters}} were simplified than in Japanese; some characters were simplified {{in only one}} language; other characters were simplified {{in the same way}} in both languages, and other characters were simplified in both languages but in different ways.

25|$|Martin {{was first}} {{selected}} {{to play for}} Canada during the 2009 World Baseball Classic. That year, {{in an effort to}} quit the use of chewing tobacco, Martin began wearing a custom-fitted mouthpiece during the WBC and Spring training. Martin hoped to switch to shortstop during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, citing he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> another pitching staff during the tournament, because he was already learning a new staff in Pittsburgh. Martin played third base in the minors before converting to catcher. Martin would later withdraw his name, citing soreness. On December 5, 2016, Martin committed to play shortstop for Team Canada at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Martin was left off of Team Canada's WBC roster on February 8, 2017, due to insurance complications relating to his minor offseason knee surgery.|$|E

25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about the author of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Goldman began feeling {{frustrated}} with lecture audiences. She yearned to [...] "reach {{the few who}} really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> rather than the many who come to be amused". She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for Mother Earth and published a book called Anarchism and Other Essays. Covering {{a wide variety of}} topics, Goldman tried to represent [...] "the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years". In addition to a comprehensive look at anarchism and its criticisms, the book includes essays on patriotism, women's suffrage, marriage, and prisons.|$|E

500|$|In addition, consumers' {{attitude}} in the US was quite different from that in the UK. Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June 1981 that [...] "our competitors thought that consumers didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> programming. We [...] think they failed because of this and because of price." [...] Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved {{it to be a}} false assumption. The TS1000/ZX81's price advantage was erased when its main rivals – the Texas Instruments TI99/4A and the Commodore VIC 20 – had their prices cut to below the all-important $100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready-made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound.|$|E

Crawford mentioned, [...] "Toddlers have tackled [...] [...] recreation centre dance classes, sorority sisters in their dorm rooms, suburban teenagers in their basements and high school cheerleaders." [...] In February 2009, Columbia Records announced the launch of a [...] "Single Ladies" [...] Dance Video Contest.

In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants.

[...] The reviewer also stated that the song's chorus was completely [...] "off guard" [...] {{to the rest of}} the track. CD Journals editors were positive towards the song, commending Nao'ymt for [...] "exhausting" [...] the [...] "goodness" [...] out of Amuro's vocal abilities. The 2014 Ballada version also received positive reviews from music critics. In another review with CD Journal, a reviewer complimented Amuro's vocals and the song's background piano composition; the reviewer also labelled the production as [...] "dramatic". In another positive review, staff member's at HMV felt that it was the best ballad on the compilation album.
