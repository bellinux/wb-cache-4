50|$|Whether EPL has {{any effect}} on {{unemployment}} {{is an issue of}} contention between economists. On the one hand, assuming that the cyclical <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> is not affected by mandated firing costs, EPL reduces the propensity to hire by employers, since they fear that such decisions will be difficult to reverse in the future, in case of a recession. On the other hand, EPL also leads firms during downswings to keep more workers employed, than they would have otherwise done. Therefore, EPL reduces both job creation and job destruction, so that the net effects on average employment and unemployment are not identifiable a priori. What is instead agreed among economists, is that more stringent EPL lowers the fluctuations in the quantity of labour demanded over the business cycle, leading to smoother dynamic patterns of those aggregates.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of MA in Governance and Development, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 80 - 85). Tea {{is the most important}} item to earn foreign currency. Bangladesh covers 2 % of world tea production which earn US$ 25000000 every year. In Bangladesh there are 163 tea gardens. Most of the tea gardens are in greater Sylhet. In tea garden human rights of the tea laborer are being violating every day. In Bangladesh <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> of laborers in other sector is more or less satisfactory. The objectives {{of the study was to}} examine the social state including <b>wage</b> <b>pattern,</b> education, health, housing, family planning activities & sanitation of the tea garden laborers as well as to understand the economic conditions – livelihood pattern, income of the tea garden laborers. Both qualitative and quantitative method was used to conduct the research. Before data collection we discussed with management and tea laborer union about their <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> and livelihood. The study was conducted with the help of structured questionnaire. Mixed methodology was followed in our study. In this study 78. 99 % of total laborers of the research garden were interviewed. Key findings are as follows: Length of service of 50. 8 % respondents is above 41 years. 26. 60 % respondents are of 3 - 4 years. But wages are same at all age level. 36. 9 % respondent are illiterate, 13. 5 % have primary edycation. 49. 6 % respondents are only literate(able to put their signature or write their name). Family member’s profession of 96 % of total respondents is day laborer. Laborers in tea garden are not satisfied with the wages they are getting. In Bangladesh minimum wage(monthly) in oil mill is BDT 7420, re-rolling mill BDT 6100, foundry BDT 5100, ship breaking BDT 4645, ayurvedic unit BDT 4320, pharmaceuticles BDT 3645, RMG BDT 3000 though in a ‘A’ category tea garden monthly wage rate of permanent laborer is BDT 1656, in ‘B’ category, BDT 1608 and C category BDT 1584. So wage of the tea laborer are minimum or below the mark throughout the country as well as abroad. Perhaps these wages rate is the lowest in the world. The study found that tea laborers are getting barren paddy land as ration with which they are not satisfied at all. 98. 40 % respondents are dissatisfied with weekly ration. 90 % respondents are dissatisfied with weekly wages. Only 9. 10 % are agreed with the existing wages to some extent. 93. 60 % are dissatisfied with sanitation facilities, 90. 90 % are not satisfied with scope for children education, 68. 70 % are are dissatisfied with job security, 63. 90 % are not satisfied with employer attitude, 92. 80 % are dissatisfied with job, 99. 20 % are dissatisfied with family planning activities, 99. 60 % are dissatisfied with housing facilities. 90. 10 % are dissatisfied with medical facilities. They are using unhygienic drinking water. So human rights are being violating in the tea garden by the employers. Labour law of Bangladesh is being violated. Since laborers are not satisfied with wages including fringe benefit, they are not attentive in increasing productivity which hampers the country’s economic growth. It can be improved the scenario of <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> and livelihood of tea garden laborer by taking into account the mentioned recommendation of the study by the policy makers. Appropriate implementation of the mentioned recommendation can improve the human rights of tea laborer as well as economic growth of this country. S. M. Sohrab HossainM.

40|$|Stylized facts {{derived from}} <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> {{analysis}} in the U. S. point {{to the importance of}} non-standard explanations for changes of relative wages. Learning while working is predicted to be able to account for wage divergence so far unexplained. Increases in productivity differ among individuals due to heterogeneity in learning capabilities which excludes a group of workers from training. This selectivity can explain relative wages changes within as well as between groups. Wage divergence within groups is an equilibrium property in the 1970 s. It was not observed before since other relative wage neutral investments were more profitable. The introduction of new production processes {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s leads to either a limited but permanent or unlimited increase in relative wages between groups. The latter happens if labor is substituted for by human capital and physical capital. It is shown how to empirically distinguish between these explanations. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} {{suggest that there is}} a large incentive for rural residents with some years of work experience to migrate from rural to urban areas in Mexico where they receive substantially higher rewards for work experience. We believe that, if the observed <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> continues to exist, the low returns to experience in rural areas will not only act as a push factor away from rural areas into large cities, but also serve as an impediment for return migration. Return migration, as shown in the literature, can however lead to increases in educational attainment (Boucher et al. 2005). Moreover, assuming that the number of rural-to-urban migrants increases faster than formal jobs can materialise, which seems realistic given the low incentives to register, unemployment, under-employment or informal employment is likely to increase in the cities. This would lead to further exacerbation of economic and social problems in these large cities and continuing lower than optimal economic growth.|$|E

A {{high level of}} inequality {{at the beginning of}} the eighties is detected, together with a pronounced rise in wage dispersion, brought about by growing inequality at the top. Changes taking place within economic activities, possibly technical progress, are the main forces driving these changes in the <b>wage</b> <b>pattern,</b> while demographic forces, as well as international trade, which could have generated shifts in the demand for labor across economic activities, should be dismissed as explanations for the rise in labor market inequality in Portugal from 1983 to 1992.

30|$|The {{findings}} {{provide evidence}} that rural–urban wage differentials are prevalent in Mexico and that differences exist in the decomposition of wages between formal and informal workers. Observed differences in all human capital related factors explain {{a large part of}} the rural–urban wage gap in the informal and formal sector. Additionally, in the informal sector, returns to experience are much lower for rural than for urban workers, even after controlling for a large number of observable characteristics. When considering that only a small part of the formal sector resides in rural areas and wages are significantly lower in rural areas, small returns to experience are definitely a push factor out of the rural and into the urban labour market, seemingly preferably and possibly easier into the informal sector when the individual is endowed with at least some years of experience. Furthermore, the results are entirely consistent with the macroeconomic picture described in the introduction. If the observed <b>wage</b> <b>pattern</b> continues to exist, low returns to experience will not only act as a push factor away from rural areas and into cities but also serve as an impediment for return migration. The fact that rural-to-urban migrants do not have lower returns to experience than other workers supports this result. Furthermore, rural-to-urban migrants enjoy an average wage premium for high levels of education. This will have further consequences for the existence of the informal sector. Assuming that formal jobs do not materialize as quickly as the rural population migrates and the social security protection system does not change fundamentally, then the size of the informal sector and unemployment is likely further to increase in the cities.|$|E
