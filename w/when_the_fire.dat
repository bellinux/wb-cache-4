5|$|Television {{coverage}} of the event showed people holding on to scaffolding around the building, and some were able to climb down to safety. One worker on the 28th floor said that workers were adding insulation to the building <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> broke out.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{morning the}} wind shifted again, {{this time to}} the north. The {{firefighting}} finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop {{the fire in the}} neighborhood around Magstræde. This failed, though, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> took the soap factory on Magstræde around noon. The wind was now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Naboløs and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, the {{regiment}} {{had an opportunity}} to apply their experience as firefighters when asked to help extinguish a blaze at the Willard Hotel. Upon receiving word from General Mansfield, commander of the Department of Washington, Ellsworth dispatched ten men from each company to attend to the fire. Soon however, the entire regiment responded to the blaze. With Ellsworth having more men on the scene than the Washington Fire Department, he claimed the fire chief's trumpet and assumed command of the incident. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> was extinguished, Henry Willard, owner of the hotel, invited {{the regiment}} to breakfast and money was collected providing them with $500.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E

Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) enters Mars Investigations and tells Keith {{that he needs}} to know the whereabouts of Kendall Casablancas. Afterwards, he blackmails Keith by showing him pictures of him and Harmony, saying that Keith must pay $4,000 to prevent the information from being shown to Harmony’s husband. Veronica gets exasperated with Meryl when she feels that Meryl refuses to see the truth about Sully cheating on her. Veronica talks to the professor about his affair with Mindy O’Dell, but he says that he’ll give her the scholarship no matter what. After seeing Meryl and Scarlett hug, Veronica tries to frame Mercer to no avail. After showing Logan the evidence that Mercer is innocent, he tells Veronica what he was doing: they were in Tijuana, and Mercer set a room on fire. There were girls in Mercer’s room, but Logan ran away <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> spread.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, Liverpool {{joined a}} group of {{warships}} that was to have escorted Trinidad on her return journey to Britain. After temporary repairs in Russia, Trinidad got underway on 13 May. The group that included Liverpool positioned itself west of Bear Island, in the Barents Sea, to rendezvous with the cruiser. On 14 May, Trinidad came under repeated attack and was set ablaze by bombs. The British had to evacuate and sink her the following day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> became uncontrollable. Liverpool {{and the rest of}} Rear-Admiral Burrough's group came under attack themselves on the return journey. On 25 May, Liverpool began escorting PQ 16, a convoy of 35 merchant vessels bound for Murmansk, the largest convoy yet undertaken in support of the Soviet Union. PQ 16 had considerable protection, including the light and heavy cruisers , Kent, and Norfolk, and numerous destroyers and submarines, with distant cover provided by the Home Fleet. Inevitably, the convoy came under attack, beginning with a sortie on 25 May that damaged the freighter SS Carlton. Sustained attacks from U-boats and at least 242 German aircraft yielded a total of seven vessels sunk on 26–27 May. The cruiser escort switched to the returning convoy QP 12 on 26 May.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Borch {{constructed}} Liebe House in 1804 on {{the site}} next to the sugar factory. It replaced a modest house with timber framing and a straw roof dating from the 17th century. The building {{takes its name from}} the Liebe family who owned the property for two generations later in the century. On the occasion of his death in 1900, Liebe left the entire building complex to Roskilde Municipality. In 1908, the Sugar House came into use as a fire station. Roskilde Local History Museum was founded on 12 November 1929 {{on the ground floor of}} the Liebe House. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> station moved to new premises in 1989, Roskilde Museum took over the Sugar House. The museum has exhibits from prehistory, through the Viking Era and the Middle Ages to modern times. The Museum of Tools, housed in separate premises, contains a collection of tools used by craftsmen such as wheelrights, carpenters, shoemakers and wood carvers from around 1850 to 1950.|$|E
