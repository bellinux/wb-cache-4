5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
25|$|Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH) {{occurs in}} older men; the prostate often enlarges {{to the point}} where urination becomes difficult. Symptoms include needing to urinate often (frequency) or taking a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started (hesitancy). If the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra and impede the flow of urine, making urination difficult and painful and, in extreme cases, completely impossible.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's second {{match was}} against the United States in Northampton, {{traditionally}} a rugby union city. The Tomahawks were made up of AMNRL players but Scotland took a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going. In the twelfth minute winger Rory Lewis unexpected put America ahead, which caused The Bravehearts to start playing well {{for the remainder of}} the first half, Scotland eventually going into the second half leading three tries to one. Graeme Thompson had kicked a penalty very early on in the game, and then after the America try added another four points. McAlister, who had missed the conversion, set up Ketteridge and Smith for Scotland's second and third tries respectively. The Bravehearts extended their lead in the second half, Shelford going over and then David Niu, who could have played for Scotland because of his Dunfermline born mother, got one back for the States. But Scotland put a victory beyond doubt with Alan Tait setting up Shelford twice for his hat-trick. Late in the game Niu and Steve Tait scored for the United States and Scotland respectively to end the match 38–16 in Scotland's favour.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It took me a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's {{not the kind of}} song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|The Scotsmans Robert McNeil {{thought that}} the premiere was [...] "shocking, but also rather slow, as {{characters}} are established. Maybe it'll get better. In the meantime, to paraphrase Roger McGough, I came, I saw, I concurred with those who say: Rome wasn't built in an hour." [...] Similarly opinionated was The Cincinnati Posts Rick Bird, who said that like other HBO series, Rome [...] "takes a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going. After the first episode you will mostly be confused with {{a dizzying array of}} characters, intrigue and subplots. Hang in there. By the second episode things take shape and one should be hooked by episode three with this steamy romp through antiquity and its lusty intrigue." [...] Bird found some positive elements; the episode, he said, was [...] "enhanced by marvelous filmmaking including elaborate sets and costumes. Small-screen film art has rarely painted such a realistic picture of ancient Rome." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] {{was written}} by Lo {{alongside}} Alx Reuterskiöld, Jakob Jerlström and Ludvig Söderberg, with the latter two being credited as The Struts. It was included on the artist's debut extended play, Truth Serum and debut studio album, Queen of the Clouds, {{both of which were}} released in 2014. Reuterskiöld also co-wrote [...] "Out of Mind" [...] from Truth Serum and [...] "Got Love" [...] from Queen of the Clouds. Regarding her work with him, the singer confessed, [...] "He's a Swedish guy and is the most artistic person I've ever met. He's very hard to work with, but he's amazing, so it's worth it. Even though he takes a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his tone down". The track was recorded at Warner/Chappell Studios in Stockholm, with The Struts producing and programming it alongside playing the keys and guitars. Lars Norgren mixed the song, while Björn Engelmann mastered it at Cutting Room, Stockholm. Reuterskiöld also co-produced it and played the keys.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian called it [...] "an astonishing achievement" [...] and [...] "absolutely bloody terrifying". He praised the way Moffat handled River Song's story, {{as well as}} for making it an [...] "intricate romp jammed with ideas that make a truly cinematic piece of drama". Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going", once it did he thought it had turned into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series. He wrote that the [...] "only real disappointment" [...] was the [...] "inference that the TARDIS doesn't really have to make its celebrated 'vworp, vworp' noise on landing", asking [...] "How can you do that to us long-time fans, Steven Moffat– that sound is part of the warp and weft of the programme!".|$|E
500|$|Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post scored Deadpool three-and-a-half stars out of four, {{calling it}} a [...] "voraciously self-aware comedy" [...] and the first R-rated Marvel film [...] "with real teeth". O'Sullivan praised the film's {{attitude}} and tone, along with Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character, and the film's action scenes. TheWrap's Alonso Duralde said Deadpool [...] "shouldn’t work, but it absolutely does", feeling that it successfully balanced the comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence. Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and {{said that it was}} [...] "smart, sexy, and outrageous", but that it would not work without Reynolds. Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five for The Guardian, calling it [...] "neurotic and needy—and very entertaining", and comparing it to Kick-Ass and Kill Bill. He did feel that the film's villains were underused though. Writing for Uproxx, Drew McWeeny described it as [...] "the world’s most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast. Varietys Justin Chang said the film is [...] "terribly arch and juvenile [...] also startlingly effective", praising Reynolds' performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying [...] "out of the way of his script and his star". Todd McCarthy at The Hollywood Reporter felt the film took a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> going, [...] "but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos".|$|E

2500|$|Peter Jackson {{claimed that}} the poor {{reception}} [...] "wasn't particularly surprising" [...] because [...] "it does take you a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to it. Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just takes a <b>while</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E

2500|$|Both men {{had come}} to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles.

2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you.
