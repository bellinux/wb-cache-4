The CE analysis was performed in a bare fused silica capillary (57 cm x 50 mu m, effective length 50 cm) with a separation buffer consisting of 0. 5 mol L(- 1) boric acid, 0. 025 mol L(- 1) hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, and 0. 8 g L(- 1) poly(ethylene oxide) 4, 000, 000 at pH 9. 10. The HPLC analysis was performed on a CAPCELL PAK C(8) SG 300 (200 x 4. 6 mm, 5 -mu m particles) column with a gradient mobile phase mixture consisting of acetonitrile and water containing trifluoroacetic acid. The CE method is suitable for the simultaneous determination of alpha-Lac, beta-Lg A, and beta-Lg B in whey powder, colostrum, and raw bovine milk, whereas the HPLC method can only be used for quantitative assays of beta-Lg A and beta-Lg B due to the co-elution of lactoferrin with alpha-Lac. Recoveries for both methods over the concentration range were between 90. 7 % and 116. 8 %. <b>Whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> had the highest content of the above three proteins.

40|$|Protein {{structure}} {{affects the}} bioactivity and functionality of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> ingredients in food systems. Bioactivity of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> and their derivatives are highly dependent upon primary, secondary and tertiary structure. The degree of denaturation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> {{is an important}} factor for determining how <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> ingredients will perform in a food system. Several analytical methods have been developed to quantify <b>protein</b> denaturation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins.</b> The goal of this project was to use a variety of analytical methods to quantify <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> denaturation and to evaluate the correlation of denaturation to the functionality of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powders.</b> The objective of the first series of experiments was to compare three different analytical methods to measure denaturation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> in liquid <b>whey</b> obtained by various methods of separation and with varying degrees of heat treatment. A split plot experimental design was used. Raw bovine milk was skimmed and liquid whey was separated from the skim milk at natural pH. Three separation methods: 1) centrifugation, 2) membrane filtration and 3) enzyme coagulation, made up the first split plot. Each sub-plot of liquid whey was then divided into three split plots to receive heat treatment. Heat treatments were no heat, 76 °C for fifteen seconds and 85 °C for three minutes. Each of the resulting nine treatment combinations was analyzed by 1) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 2) bicinchoninic acid-soluble protein assay and 3) fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the amount of denatured protein in the liquid whey. Fluorescence spectroscopy was found to be the most sensitive and reliable method for detecting differences in structure due to denaturation, while native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was found to be the least sensitive method. The sample which received the centrifugal treatment of isolation with no heat was found to be the most undenatured in structure while the sample which received the enzyme treatment of isolation with high heat was found to be the most denatured in structure. The objective of the second series of experiments was to evaluate the effect of denaturation on <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> solubility in dried <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powders.</b> Solubility {{is one of the most}} important functional properties to consider when selecting a <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> ingredient, especially for beverage systems. Processing parameters are often manipulated in efforts to improve solubility. The <b>protein</b> structures of <b>whey</b> are considered to have an effect on solubility. Specifically, the degree of denaturation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> is thought to play a role in solubility. In this experimental design, raw bovine milk was skimmed and pasteurized then enzyme-coagulated at natural pH to separate the whey. Liquid whey was then split into three aliquots and each received one of the following treatments: 1) mild heat/ freeze dry, 2) mild heat/spray dry and 3) high heat/spray dry. Heat treatment was applied to liquid whey prior to concentration. Heat treated whey was then concentrated and dried. Powders were reconstituted and analyzed for denaturation using 1) bicinchoninic acid assay for soluble protein and 2) fluorescence spectroscopy and for solubility using an insolubility index. pH 4. 6 solubility and fluorescence spectroscopy for quantifying denaturation correlated well to one another. Both found that the low heat treated samples were less denatured in structure than the sample which received the high heat treatment, regardless of drying method. However, the drying method of the <b>protein</b> <b>powders</b> was correlated to solubility rather than heat treatment. A correlation of denaturation measured in <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powders</b> and solubility was apparent for the low heat, freeze dried sample and the high heat, spray dried sample. Several conclusions were made in this research. 1) Centrifugal force causes less denaturation than membrane filtration and enzyme coagulation, thus unheated liquid whey obtained by centrifugal force can be used as a control in research on denaturation. 1) Fluorescence spectroscopy is a better method for quantifying denaturation in liquid and powdered whey compared to native PAGE and pH 4. 6 solubility measured by BCA. 3) Functional solubility is dependent on denaturation and can be correlated to analytical methods of measuring denaturation...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} method to study rehydration was used on different dairy powders. The method involved dispersing powder in a stirred vessel {{equipped with a}} turbidity sensor. The changes of turbidity occurring during powder rehydration highlighted the rehydration stage, {{and the influence of}} the proteins’ state on rehydration was clarified. Casein powders had a quick wetting time but very slow dispersion, making the total rehydration process time-consuming. On the other hand, whey powders were found to have poor wettability but demonstrated immediate dispersion after wetting. Mixing casein (80 %) and whey (20 %) before spray drying greatly improved rehydration time compared with casein powder; whereas mixing whey powder with casein powder at the same ratio after spray drying caused a dramatic deterioration in the rehydration properties. Moreover, agglomeration was found to significantly improve the rehydration time of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> and to slow down the rehydration time of casein powder.

40|$|The fish {{industry}} in Norway produced 885 000 tonnes of rest raw material in 2014. Today, {{most of the}} rest raw material from fish, such as herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), is used in silage or fishmeal and -oil production for animal and fish feed. With a growing world population, {{it is important that the}} fish material is used as sustainably as possible. Transforming rest raw material from the fish {{industry in}}to products for human consumption will increase the profitability of the industry. Protein powders made from herring and salmon can be used as functional ingredients in food or as a nutritional supplement. The aim of this study was to compare the nutritional, functional, bioactive and sensory properties of protein powders from herring roe, salmon and whey. The chemical composition varied between the different raw materials, and the protein content ranged from 64. 0 to 81. 5 %. The herring protein powder (HPP) and <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> (WPP) had the highest nutritional values due to a high con¬tent of proteins and essential amino acids, which exceeded the requirements set by FAO/WHO for an adult human. A pepsin/HCl solution was used to simulate the digestion of proteins in the stomach. The digestibility of the HPP and WPP were above 90 %, while the digestibility of salmon meal was approximately 72 %. The molecular weights of the soluble proteins in the WPP and salmon meal were investigated with gel filtration. The WPP consisted mainly of peptide fractions with molecular weights of 4700 and 13 000 Da, while the salmon meal consisted of peptide fractions below 900 Da. This correlated well with the higher amount of free amino acids (FAA) measured for salmon meal dissolved in distilled water and citric acid-phosphate buffer, compared to the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> dissolved in the same solvents. From earlier studies, the solubility of the herring protein powder was reported to be below 2 % in distilled water. Enzymatic hydrolysis with trypsin was performed and the effect on different characteristics and properties were investigated. The minor change in molecular weight distribution, low amount of FAA and acid soluble peptides, together with low a solubility (less than 7 %), indicate that the herring protein powder hydrolysate mainly consisted of insoluble intact proteins similar to the native HPP. This makes it difficult to use the powder in liquid products, such as sports drinks or drinking yoghurts. The solubility of the salmon meal and WPP were also investigated, in addition to other functional properties such as emulsion capacity, emulsion stability, water holding capacity (WHC) and swelling capacity. The solubility was determined both as a function of pH and temperature. At a pH between pH 3 and 7, the solubility of the WPP and salmon meal ranged from 65. 7 to 95. 9 % and 14. 2 to 18. 1 %, respectively. The effect from increasing the temperature on the solubility of HPP and salmon meal was minimal. Both the emulsion capacity and stability were higher for the WPP compared to the salmon meal. Although the salmon meal was able to form an emulsion, it was not able to make it stabile, and this would make it difficult to use the salmon meal as an emulsifier in multiple phase foods. WHC was the functional property where salmon meal showed significantly better properties than WPP. The WHC of minced cod filets increased with addition of salmon meal, while it decreased with addition of WPP. A positive correlation was observed between a high water holding capacity and a high swelling capacity. The antioxidant properties of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> was investigated with the DPPH scavenging method. The scavenging of the DPPH radicals increased with increasing WPP concentration. The DPPH method was not suitable for measuring the antioxidant properties of salmon meal and no results were obtained for the bioactive properties of this powder. Bread rolls were made from mixtures of wheat flour, wholemeal and 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % of WPP, HPP or salmon meal. The bread rolls mixed with WPP received the best acceptance. The low solubility of the HPP resulted in a grainy mouthfeel at high protein concentrations. A fishy taste and odour, probably due to the high fat content (17. 3 %) were the major problems with the salmon meal bread rolls. Protein addition above 10 % is probably necessary in order to increase the protein intake from bread rolls significantly. Among the three protein powders investigated in this study, WPP has most likely the best potential as a food additive due to the high nutritional value and sensory acceptance. If the sensory properties of HPP could be improved by modifications of the proteins or taste masking, this powder could also be used in enrichment products. This would be desirable due to a high nutritional quality of the herring roe proteins...|$|E

40|$|Native milk {{proteins}} are natural surfactants used to emulsify and to stabilize dairy emulsions. However, at high protein concentrations, {{they do not}} sufficiently stabilize emulsions against flocculation, coalescence, aggregation or gelation during processing such as heat treatments and manufacturers used to add non-dairy additives to prevent above mentioned detrimental instabilities. Identification of alternative ways to protect dairy emulsions against instabilities without using non-dairy additives is an active research area in order to match with new market trends (clean label tendency). Alternatives using whey protein aggregates were suggested to be more efficient than native whey proteins to stabilize emulsions at high protein concentration 1 but the exact mechanism is not completely clarified especially in an industrial context where whey protein ingredients contain variable amounts of caseins, peptides, etc. To address this question we investigated the protein interfacial composition and the stability of dairy emulsions reconstituted with 30 % milk fat and 3 to 6 % model whey protein solutions unheated or heated prior to homogenization. Heating whey protein solutions at pH 7. 0 prior to homogenization allowed the production of 70 nm-sized protein aggregates. Emulsion stability was determined by visual observation, granulometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy after heating the samples at 120 °C up to 30 min. Emulsions prepared with unheated whey proteins did not show any sign of macroscopic instabilities up to 30 min of heating at low protein concentration (3 %), but show a gradual decrease of heat stability when protein concentration increased. Instability at high protein concentration was due to protein aggregation or gelation in the continuous phase with the participation of protein-coated fat globules. In the opposite, emulsions formed with whey protein aggregates were destabilized at 10 min of heating for low protein concentration (3 %), but were more stable at higher concentration. The destabilization at low protein concentration was governed by the aggregation of interfacial whey protein aggregates leading to fat globule flocculation and emulsion thickening. The stability of the emulsions at protein concentration higher than 4 % was correlated with {{the stability of the}} aggregates in the aqueous phase and the decrease in the proportion of whey protein aggregates at the oil/water interface due to an increasing competition with peptides and caseins naturally present in the model <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder...</b>|$|E

Methods: Two studies were conducted in a double-blinded, counterbalanced manner. Study I was designed to determine the glycemic index, while study II determined the utilization of substrates and subsequent exercise performance. Ten healthy male participants (age 21. 70 ± 2. 41 years, height 176. 60 ± 5. 23 cm, weight 66. 58 ± 5. 38 kg, V̇O 2 max 48. 1 ± 8. 4 mL/kg/min) participated in both study I and study II. Three types of commercially available sports beverage powders were used. The powders consisted primarily of oligosaccharides (low molecular weight carbohydrates, L-CHO), hydrolyzed starch (high molecular weight CHO, H-CHO), and <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> with carbohydrate (CHO-PRO). They were dissolved in purified water with identical CHO concentration of 8 % (w/v). In study I, each participant underwent two oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and one glycemic response test for each sports drink. In study II, participants cycled for 60 min at 70 % V̇O 2 max, one hour after consuming a standardized breakfast. One of four prescribed beverages (L-CHO, H-CHO, CHO-PRO, and Placebo control, PLA) was served at 0, 15, 30, 45 min during the exercise. Six hours after the first exercise session, participants came back for a “time to exhaustion test” (TTE). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min in the first exercise session, while arterial blood gas analysis was conducted at 0, 30, and 60 min in both sessions. Subjective feelings (rating of perceived exertion and abdominal discomfort) were also evaluated every 30 min during exercise. Results: Compared to the reference standardized glucose solution, the glycemic index of the L-CHO beverage was 117. 70 ± 14. 25, while H-CHO was 105. 50 ± 12. 82, and CHO-PRO was 67. 23 ± 5. 88. During the exercise test, the insulin level at 30 and 60 min was significantly lower than baseline following the treatment of L-CHO, H-CHO, and PLA (p 0. 05). Conclusion: The CHO sports beverage with additional PRO maintains insulin production during endurance cycling at 70 % V̇O 2 max in the postprandial state. L-CHO sports beverage suppresses fat utilization during the subsequent exercise performance test.

Our results indicated that oil-in-water emulsions, stabilized by 5 % (w/w) protein samples, exhibited a shear-thinning flow behaviour, and the harsher the spray-drying conditions (the higher the protein denaturation), the less viscous were the emulsions.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how the physical state of water in low-moisture foods influences the survival of Salmonella and to use this information to develop mathematical models that predict the behavior of Salmonella in these foods. <b>Whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder</b> of differing water mobilities was produced by pH adjustment and heat denaturation, and then equilibrated to aw levels between 0. 19 ± 0. 03 and 0. 54 ± 0. 02.

Survival data was fitted to the log-linear, the Geeraerd-tail, the Weibull, the biphasic-linear and the Baranyi models. The model with the best ability to describe the data over all temperatures, water activities and water mobilities (ftest<Ftable) was selected for secondary modeling. The Weibull model provided the best description of survival kinetics for Salmonella. The influence of temperature, aw and water mobility on the survival of Salmonella was evaluated using multiple linear regression. Secondary models were developed and then validated in dry non-fat dairy and grain, and low-fat peanut and cocoa products within the range of the modeled data. Water activity significantly influenced the survival of Salmonella at all temperatures, survival increasing with decreasing aw. Water mobility did not significantly influence survival independent of aw. Secondary models were useful in predicting the survival of Salmonella in various low-moisture foods providing a correlation of R= 0. 94 and an acceptable prediction performance of 81 %. The % bias and % discrepancy results showed that the models were more accurate in predicting survival in non-fat food systems as compared to foods containing low-fat levels (12 % fat). The models developed in this study represent the first predictive models for survival of Salmonella in low-moisture foods.

40|$|Drying is an {{important}} process {{for a variety of}} industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and chemicals, and produce products with low bulk density, good shelf stability, economical storage and transport, and in some cases unique structural qualities. Of the various drying methods available, freeze-drying is the most beneficial for heat sensitive products that susceptible to thermal degradation. Freezedrying also confers a porous structure on the material result from the voids left after subliming the ice crystals. Freeze-drying however is used mainly for high value products due to the high capital and operational costs. The cycle time of such a drier may take several hours. The spray-freeze-drying process has evolved in an attempt to shorten the freezedrying process time. The process atomises a liquid feed to increase the heat and mass transfer surface area. The spray is then frozen in a very cold gas or a cryogenic liquid to form solid particles, which are then freeze-dried. Some processes incorporate a - fluidised bed freeze-drier to reduce the drying time by forced convection heat and mass transfer. This project aim to develop the Spray Freeze- Drying process and examine the effect of the process on the drying entities and resulting product quality, followed by modelling of the spray freezing operation in an attempt to optimise the operation. This thesis is divided into two main areas of investigations; Spray freezing investigation as an influential on the resulting product size and structure. The experiments performed using Phase Doppler Anemometry technique to measure the particle size distributions and velocities in a specially constructed spray freezing chamber with incorporated windows. A spray freeze-drying chamber was constructed composed of three parts co-current spray freezing, gas - particle separation, and fluidisation freeze-drying unites. Successfully spray characterisation measurement was carried in both ambient and sub-ambient temperatures, producing data of the drop size distribution and velocities from refractive scattered laser PDA measurement. The technique produced valuable information about the spray size distribution and velocity, the application of this technique appear was a novel approach in the spray freezing process measurement. The result were used in the established spray freezing model derived from Pham (1984) freezing model incorporating with a recalescence stage from the Hindmarsh (2003) spray freezing model. The current model predicted the droplet freezing time, which is influenced by the droplet diameter, velocity and freezing gas temperature. The results also shows an agreement between the freezing time predicted and the PDA recognition of bursts rejected due to their possible phase change.

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityDrying is an important process {{for a variety of}} industries such as pharmaceuticals, food, and chemicals, and produce products with low bulk density, good shelf stability, economical storage and transport, and in some cases unique structural qualities. Of the various drying methods available, freeze-drying is the most beneficial for heat sensitive products that susceptible to thermal degradation. Freezedrying also confers a porous structure on the material result from the voids left after subliming the ice crystals. Freeze-drying however is used mainly for high value products due to the high capital and operational costs. The cycle time of such a drier may take several hours. The spray-freeze-drying process has evolved in an attempt to shorten the freezedrying process time. The process atomises a liquid feed to increase the heat and mass transfer surface area. The spray is then frozen in a very cold gas or a cryogenic liquid to form solid particles, which are then freeze-dried. Some processes incorporate a - fluidised bed freeze-drier to reduce the drying time by forced convection heat and mass transfer. This project aim to develop the Spray Freeze- Drying process and examine the effect of the process on the drying entities and resulting product quality, followed by modelling of the spray freezing operation in an attempt to optimise the operation. This thesis is divided into two main areas of investigations; Spray freezing investigation as an influential on the resulting product size and structure. The experiments performed using Phase Doppler Anemometry technique to measure the particle size distributions and velocities in a specially constructed spray freezing chamber with incorporated windows. A spray freeze-drying chamber was constructed composed of three parts co-current spray freezing, gas - particle separation, and fluidisation freeze-drying unites. Successfully spray characterisation measurement was carried in both ambient and sub-ambient temperatures, producing data of the drop size distribution and velocities from refractive scattered laser PDA measurement. The technique produced valuable information about the spray size distribution and velocity, the application of this technique appear was a novel approach in the spray freezing process measurement. The result were used in the established spray freezing model derived from Pham (1984) freezing model incorporating with a recalescence stage from the Hindmarsh (2003) spray freezing model. The current model predicted the droplet freezing time, which is influenced by the droplet diameter, velocity and freezing gas temperature. The results also shows an agreement between the freezing time predicted and the PDA recognition of bursts rejected due to their possible phase change. The spray-freezing-drying chamber was operated in vacuum conditions to produce freeze-dried <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powder.</b> The powder characteristic results shows an physical properties such as density, solubility and particle sizes in comparison to spray drying and cryo-spray freeze-drying.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop a <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> base {{beverage}} for a specific target group, Baby boomers. The Baby boomers are the generation born between 1946 - 1964. Consumer research shows that this group takes a keen interest in their health and have the ambition to stay healthy. However, at the same time age related conditions, like stiff joints but also cancer, starts to appear. Therefore a product based on <b>whey</b> <b>protein,</b> with health benefits suitable for this target group was developed. The product was developed in coop-eration with Arla Foods; the product development process was hence according to their routines. Background information about the needs of Baby boomers, requirements of the product, process and ingredients was gathered through literature research and interviews with employees at Arla Foods Three <b>powders</b> with different <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> content were tested in a raspberry flavoured beverage Vitamin D and calcium was included in the recipe to add health benefits. Samples were produced in lab scale, but also in a pilot plant. Some problems with the process occurred in the first pilot plant trial and several changes had to be made in the second trial. A trained sensory panel then evaluated the samples, and nutri-tional values were calculated. The sensory evaluation showed all the three samples had off flavours, and one sample also separated when raspberry puree was added. The nutritional value was calculated based on the recipes. The values differed between the samples, with better results for the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powders</b> with higher <b>protein</b> content. More work has to be done to improve the nutritional values, but most of all the sensory properties of the product...|$|R
40|$|<b>Whey</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are derived}} from milk and are widely used in the food {{industry}} for their nutritional and functional properties. Many studies have been undertaken on {{the improvement of the}} functional properties of these proteins, mainly by their heat-induced denaturation/aggregation. Depending on the heating conditions, it is possible to obtain a variety of aggregates that have different structures and different physicochemical properties, leading to remarkable techno-functional properties, such as gelling, foaming or emulsification (Nicolai et al., 2011). While many works has been dedicated to heat treatments of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> as present in a solution, very few studies considered heat as applied in a dry state, say by applying heat on powder. This heating pathway was reported to strongly affect the heat-induced gelling properties of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> (Gulzar et al., 2012). The {{purpose of this study was}} to produce particles having high functional properties by dry heating of a <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> isolate <b>powder.</b> Power composition effects were investigated on the formation and the structure of particles. Moreover, special attention was paid to the role of lactose in the formation of these uncommon particles...|$|R
40|$|In {{their native}} state <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> possess unique {{globular}} configuration {{which is important}} in imparting functional properties such as solubility, emulsification, foaming and gelling. <b>Whey</b> <b>proteins</b> have to pass {{through a series of}} processing steps such as filtration, evaporation and drying when they are converted into powders. Spray drying is the most commonly used drying method to produce <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> isolate (WPI) <b>powders</b> and it is known to exert denaturing stresses such as thermal, dehydration and interfacial stresses to proteins. These stresses denature <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> and the resultant WPI powders show poor functional activities. Presently {{there is a lack of}} information in the literature regarding the relationship between denaturation kinetics and drying kinetics (moisture content, temperature histories and drying rate) and development of morphology during particle formation process of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins.</b> In addition, there is inadequate information regarding the efficacy of protectant solids such as lactose, trehalose and polysorbate- 80 in minimising the denaturation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> during drying at an individual droplet level. Single droplet dryer was used in this study to obtain these properties in WPI and WPI-protectant droplets and particles. This fundamental information can be used to produce less denatured and functionally superior <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>powders</b> through spray drying. The denaturation was measured using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP‑HPLC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The drying and denaturation kinetics of WPI droplets were simulated by using Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) and first order reaction kinetics, respectively and they were integrated into a single model. The extent and nature of denaturation of WPI in spray drying process was measured using a laboratory scale spray dryer. It was found that, WPI was denatured about 68. 5 &plusmn; 0. 05 % by convective drying for 600 s at 65 oC and 80 oC. The moisture, temperature and denaturation histories of WPI during convective drying at single droplet level were successfully predicted using REA and first order reaction kinetics models. It was also found that the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> bovine serum albumin had the highest, &beta;-lactoglobulin had the lowest and &alpha;-lactalbumin had intermediate stability under convective drying conditions. Addition of 20 % trehalose resulted into almost complete protection of WPI from loss due to irreversible denaturation, while addition of 30 % lactose could protect only up to 70 % of WPI. The secondary structural features (&beta;-sheet, &beta;-turn and random coil) of WPI were significantly altered even in the presence of these two sugars. There was no loss of WPI through denaturation induced aggregation when WPI was spray dried at inlet and outlet temperatures of 180 oC and 80 oC, respectively. However, the secondary structural features were found to be altered significantly. Addition of up to 0. 01 % polysorbate‑ 80 with WPI as an excipient effectively protected the &alpha;-helix and &beta;-sheet from alteration. The spray dried WPI powders produced in the presence and absence of lactose, trehalose and polysorbate‑ 80 had characteristic wrinkled surface morphology and were amorphous in nature...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> concentrate <b>powders</b> is often {{limited by the}} fouling of the ultrafiltration membranes and the low heat stability of the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> solutions. Ultrasonic treatment of whey solutions has previously been shown to break down protein aggregates and improve heat stability. This study investigates the use of ultrasound as a pre-treatment step to improve downstream ultrafiltration performance. Results show that sonication alone alleviated membrane fouling to a small extent. However, the use of ultrasound following heat exposure reduced membrane pore blockage and growth of the foulant cake greatly, relative to heat exposure {{in the absence of}} ultrasound. The extent of changes to pore blockage and cake growth was greater at higher solids concentration. In all cases, the protein concentration in the permeate remained unchanged. This work has the potential to reduce energy requirements in the ultrafiltration of whey as feed pre-treatment by both ultrasound and the combination of heat and ultrasound produced a lower viscosity feed solution...|$|R

The surface composition of these powders {{is expected to}} play an essential role during their storage, handling and/or final application. Therefore, an eventual control of the surface composition by modifying the spray-drying temperature could be very useful in the improvement of powder quality {{and the development of}} new applications. For this purpose, the influence of five spray-drying temperatures upon the surface composition of the powders was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The major milk proteins were studied: native micellar casein and native whey, both more or less enriched in lactose. The results show a surface enrichment in lipids for all the <b>powders</b> and in <b>proteins</b> for many <b>powders.</b> Whatever the drying temperature, lipids and proteins are preferentially located near the surface whereas lactose is found in the core. This surface enrichment is also highly affected by the spray-drying temperature. More lipids, more proteins and less lactose are systematically observed at the surface of powders spray-dried at lower outlet air temperatures. The nature of proteins is also found essential; surface enrichment in lipids being much stronger for <b>whey</b> <b>proteins</b> containing <b>powders</b> than for casein containing powders. Additionally, we found a direct correlation between the lipids surface concentration and the wetting ability for the 25 powders studied...|$|R

This study was performed {{to determine the effects of}} different storage conditions applied to WPI powders on heat induced aggregation of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins,</b> and simultaneously on both protein denaturation and lactosylation. Therefore, two different storage conditions regarding temperature (20 and 40 °C) have been carried out for periods of up to 15 months. On the one hand, our results showed that protein lactosylation occurred in WPI powders at 20 °C, but heat induced aggregation did not significantly differ from non-aged <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> isolates. On the other hand, powders presented a high level of denaturation and aggregation at 40 °C, involving first protein lactosylation and then aggregation in the dry state. These evolutions were correlated with an increasing Browning Index starting from the first month of storage, and with a decrease in aggregate size after heat treatment at pH ≥ 5. 8. A change in the shapes of heat induced aggregates was concomitantly observed.

40|$|AbstractHeating in dry {{state has}} gained a lot of {{interest}} in pharmaceutical and food industries for viral and microbial decontamination of thermo sensible products. Controlled dry heating has now become a common industrial process for improving the functional properties of food proteins. Besides this improvement, chemical modifications in protein structures involving degradation of amino acids, new intra or inter-molecular disulfide bonds, isopeptide bonds, and some other links may occur. These chemical modifications are favored by severe heating under neutral or alkaline conditions, and except disulfide interchanges, are usually not predominant during heat treatments in solution and their occurrence is not well understood. Understanding chemical modifications in protein structure that occur during dry heating of <b>protein</b> <b>powders</b> is a prerequisite for reproducible properties of final products at industrial scale. In the present work, we focused on how dry heating under acidic pH conditions affects the chemical modifications and denaturation/aggregation reactions of <b>whey</b> <b>proteins.</b> Model <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> (β-lactoglobulin) <b>powders</b> obtained from freeze drying of protein concentrates adjusted to pHs 2. 5 & 6. 5 were adjusted to a fixed water activity (Aw 0. 23). The samples were dry heated at 100 °C for up to 24 hours and structural modifications induced during dry heating were followed. We showed that whatever the pH value, proteins were characterized by irreversible mass losses of 18 Da. Such mass losses were increased at lower pH value. Dry heating mainly generated small aggregates (dimers and oligomers). Strikingly, at pH 2. 5 intermolecular disulfide bonds were the only crosslinks between proteins in the aggregated forms while covalent crosslinks other than disulfide bonds also participated at pH 6. 5. β-Lactoglobulin hydrolysis was also detected at pH 2. 5 and some of the peptides were incorporated in the oligomers. These results underline that chemical modifications in protein structures induced by dry heating are highly pH dependent. Hence, strict control of pH conditions for dry heating is indispensable to give reproducible functionality in products where such modified proteins are incorporated as ingredient...|$|R

The effect of ozonation on the solubility and the foaming properties of proteins are also determined. Results show a reduction of free sulphhydryl groups and an increase of surface hydrophobicity, indicating a self-rearrangement in the protein structure following ozonation. Thus, ozonation allows creation of a more flexible structure without formation of a strong network of disulphide bond or aggregations, which is corroborated by the turbidity analysis and SDS-PAGE. Ozone processing induces modifications that improve the foaming capacity and foam stability, however, a slight reduction in the solubility is encountere...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the protein denaturation in a pilot scale spray dryer. The occurrence of protein denaturation is due to external stresses, such as heat. Thus, this project describes a pilot process for obtaining <b>protein</b> isolates from <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> in <b>powder</b> form via spray drying process with improved water solubility and technofunctional properties as well as reduced thermal damage. The experiment, including varying the inlet air temperature at 100 °C and 160 °C as well as utilising the microencapsulation technique using a starch derived polysaccharide (or known as maltodextrin) to minimize the protein denaturation. The Reversed phase HPLC (RP-I-IPLC) technique {{has been applied to}} measure the denaturation of proteins in the samples which are with maltodextrin and without maltodextrin resulting from the spray drying of milk solution at inlet temperature of 100 °C and 160 °C. The combination of maltodextrin (MD) and fresh milk (FM) is at standard ratio of FM/MD (9 : 1) in order to produce spherical and smooth powder. Apart from the RP-HPLC method, the SDS-PAGE method also used to analyze the protein content.
