40|$|We {{document}} positive valuation effects {{around the}} time of stock market liberalization. We find that the valuation effects are larger for <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> civil law traditions compared <b>with</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> common law origins. Similarly, we find that <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> weaker shareholder protections exhibit greater market valuation increases compared <b>with</b> <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> stronger shareholder protections. The results reinforce the importance of country legal systems and of shareholder protections in determining the quality of corporate governance systems and financial market outcomes. The findings suggest that stock market liberalization may mitigate deficiencies in the existing institutional environments not supportive of effective corporate governance systems. 2005 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R
