5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald {{is known to have}} become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E
