Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E

5|$|The new film, now titled Terminator Genisys and {{intended}} to be a reboot of the series <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> launching a new trilogy, was announced in the summer of 2013, with Schwarzenegger confirming to reprise his role as the T-800. Filming began on April 21, 2014, and the film was released on July 1, 2015. However, despite the film's financial success, it was not well received by critics and fans of the series. James Cameron regained the rights to the film franchise; he and director Tim Miller will supervise the film series after Genisys.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{bounced back}} the {{following}} season, winning their second League title. Arsenal {{had started the}} season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the future Chapman promoted George Male to {{the first team to}} replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.|$|E

Hannah Minghella and Rachel O’Connor would oversee the development and production of these films for the studio. In April 2014, {{it was announced that}} Goddard would direct the Sinister Six film, and that both spin-offs would be released before a fourth Amazing Spider-Man, with Spider-Man potentially appearing in both spin-offs. Later in the month, Tolmach and Arad revealed the Sinister Six film would be a redemption story and that the film's lineup might differ from the comics. On July 23, 2014, Sony Pictures announced that The Sinister Six was scheduled for release on November 11, 2016. By August 2014, Sony was also looking to release a female-centered spin-off film in 2017, with Lisa Joy writing, and had given the Venom spin-off the potential title of Venom: Carnage.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his {{way back into the}} Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the future. With the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E
