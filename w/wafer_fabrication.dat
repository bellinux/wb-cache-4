25|$|Further {{economic}} success {{continued through the}} 1980s onwards, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% during this time until 1999. In the 1980s, Singapore faced the challenge of needing to upgrade its industries to higher-technology industries, in order to compete with its neighbours which were exporting the same things at a lower price. Originally, Singapore manufactured goods such as textiles. A skilled workforce with an aptitude for learning helped ease the transition, for example, to new jobs in the <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> industry, which was quickly being established in Singapore.|$|E

As of 2008, according to PUB NEWater was able to meet 30% of Singapore's water requirements. The high purity of the water has actually allowed industries to reduce their costs. With {{the construction of the}} Deep Tunnel Sewerage System the decentralized water reclamation plants and NEWater factories are expected to be gradually closed and replaced by the single, much larger water reclamation plant and NEWater factory at Changi at the Eastern end of Singapore Island. The Bedok reclamation plant {{was the first one to}} be decommissioned in 2009, followed by the Seletar plant in 2011. The Bedok NEWater plant, however, continued to operate, while the Seletar NEWater plant was decommissioned along with the reclamation plant. The Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Bedok reclamation plants had been upgraded in 1999-2001, making them more compact so that they needed less land and covering them for odor control in order to make nearby land more valuable.|$|E
40|$|In <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrications,</b> {{engineers}} {{will set}} a queue time limit between particular operations {{to ensure the}} final product yield, which is named “time constraint. ” Due to the dilemma of increasing machine efficiency or decreasing the queue time of WIP, time constraint issues become more complex in batch processing. This work proposed a shop-floor control policy in serial-batch-serial processes with time constraints. The concept of safety stock ([S,s] policy) is introduced to control the WIP level, simultaneously avoiding machine idle and wafers exceeding time constraints. Length of time constraints, MTTR of machines and service rate of workstations are adopted to determine the batch size and boundaries of the WIP level. The job hold/release policy is addressed to control situations of excessively high WIP levels. Furthermore, the performances of the proposed model are compared with DJAH and MBSX rules. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed model could control the batch processing with time constraints more effectively...|$|R

25|$|Singapore gained {{independence}} as the Republic of Singapore (remaining {{within the}} Commonwealth of Nations) on 9 August 1965 with Lee Kuan Yew {{as the prime}} minister and Yusof bin Ishak as the president. Race riots broke out once more in 1969. In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister, and the country moved from Third World economy to First World affluence in a single generation. Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century.

2500|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry, including IC manufacturing, design, and packing, forms a {{major part}} of Taiwan's IT industry. Due to its strong capabilities in OEM wafer manufacturing and a complete industry supply chain, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors. The sector output reached US$39 billion in 2009, ranking first in global market share in IC manufacturing, packaging, and testing, and second in IC design. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest [...] contract chipmakers in the world, while MediaTek is the fourth-largest fabless supplier globally. In 1987, TSMC pioneered the fabless foundry model, reshaping the global semiconductor industry. From ITRI's first 3-inch <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> plant built in 1977 and the founding of UMC in 1980, the industry has developed into a world leader with 40 fabs in operation by 2002. In 2007, the semiconductor industry overtook that of the United States, second only to Japan. Although the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010 affected sales and exports, the industry has rebounded with companies posting record profits for 2010. Taiwan has the largest share of 300nm, 90nm, and 60nm manufacturing capacities worldwide, and was expected to pass Japan in total IC fab capacity by mid-2011.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{waferbonding}} is {{an appropriate}} technology to join two or more wafers of the same or of different materials. Waferbonding {{can be used to}} stiffen thin <b>wafers</b> during <b>fabrication.</b> However, conventional fabrication processes lead to an increase of the bond strength, which inhibits the required de-bonding. The propagation of cracks, which is based on a subcritical crack growth in the bonded interface, was used to cleave the bonded wafers. The subcritical crack growth is limited to the bonded interface, since the adjacent bulk semiconductor materials are inherently resistant to subcritical crack growth. The process allows the separation of Si-Si and Si-GaAs wafers after annealing. Wafer-bonded SOI wafers can also be separated with this technology even if they were annealed at 1100 °C. The first examples for <b>wafer</b> stiffening during <b>fabrication</b> and <b>wafer</b> transfer using the developed approach will be presented...|$|R
