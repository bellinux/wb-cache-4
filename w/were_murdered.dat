5|$|Australian and US forces {{attacked}} the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 {{but did not}} capture it until January 1943. The Allied force comprised the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32nd Infantry Division and was short of artillery and supplies. Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred around infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943. Throughout the fighting in Papua, most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops <b>were</b> <b>murdered.</b> In response, Australian soldiers aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents {{for the remainder of the}} war. The Australians generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel, and some prisoners of war <b>were</b> <b>murdered.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians <b>were</b> <b>murdered</b> by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being burned at the stake. His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Anastasia and {{her family}} were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church.

5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened. Many bishops <b>were</b> <b>murdered</b> during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time.

5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they <b>were</b> <b>murdered.</b> Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, <b>were</b> <b>murdered,</b> and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal.

Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour.

Several thousand Jews <b>were</b> <b>murdered</b> in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
