5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home {{as a result of his}} mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area.

25|$|Rime {{was hired}} as coach ahead of the 1977 season, which ended in only a single win, last place {{in the league and}} relegation. The {{following}} season would see Rosenborg play a local derby {{for the first time in}} twelve years, against Strindheim, and the club management was worried that the relegation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the club's position as the city's premier team. The club moved its offices into a German barracks from the war, located outside Lerkendal and Eggen was again hired as coach. The season saw the break-through of three young players—Øivind Husby, Ola By Rise and Knut Torbjørn Eggen—and ended with Rosenborg winning the league and being promoted and Eggen becoming top scorer.|$|E

If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous {{as a result of the}} strike.|$|E

25|$|During {{the relief}} attempt Vere was {{inspecting}} the English trenches when heavy fighting broke {{out as a}} sally was launched on the position. The Spanish were repelled but Vere was severely injured when a bullet went through his head beneath his eye and became embedded in his skull.

As a consequence of Vere's wound the young Frederick Henry who was only eighteen years old took over Vere's command, while Horace Vere (brother to Francis) took over the English troops in the field. The Earl of Leicester arrived at the siege in late August in case Francis' wound was mortal and needed to fill in his command but this was denied by Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|Bradshaw threw a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Bennie Cunningham in the third quarter, and later a 9-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Stallworth that gave the Steelers a 28-17 lead three plays into the fourth quarter. But this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his success as he completed only three of his next 11 passes in the final quarter. The next time Pittsburgh had the ball, cornerback Jeff Allen intercepted Bradshaw's pass and returned it eight yards to the Steelers 29-yard line. Pittsburgh defensive back Mel Blount intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} on the second play of the ensuing drive, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty on linebacker Jack Ham. Five plays later, Fouts cut the score to 28-24 with an 8-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Winslow. Following six consecutive handoffs by Bradshaw, San Diego got the ball back on their own 36-yard line due to a 20-yard punt by John Goodson with four minutes left in the game. Four runs by Muncie moved the ball 33 yards to a third and 7 situation on the Steelers 12-yard line. On the next play, Fouts connected with Winslow on a screen pass, and the tight end took {{it all the way to}} the end zone for the game winning score with less than a minute left on the clock.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{contemplated}} {{standing for}} Parliament. In 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland {{had offered to}} get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new “National” party of 20–30 MPs, which would include David Davies {{who had been on}} the mission to Russia. The new party’s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged Irish conscription – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his army career (he was also short of money – he had a private income of £300 a year, and half pay of £600 (£450 after tax) – but his house at Eaton Place was costing him £1,500 a year). His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson (who told Wilson that there was no army job for him in Britain), but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson’s hopes that, like J.C.Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner’s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election (caused by the death of Willie Redmond) and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and “some natives” agreed on the need for conscription. Brock Millman argued that the threat to stand for Parliament was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George, but Keith Jeffery rejects this, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 French was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.|$|E

30|$|The endometriotic disease theory [32, 33] {{suggested}} that subtle endometriosis was a benign condition occurring intermittently in all women, whereas typical, cystic, and deep endometriosis <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> points {{of three different}} diseases.

This hypothesis easily explains the effects of dioxin, of total body radiation, and the hereditary aspects. A strong argument <b>is</b> <b>the</b> findings that cystic and deep endometriosis is clonal in origin.
