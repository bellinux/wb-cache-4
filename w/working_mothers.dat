Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of <b>working</b> <b>mothers,</b> and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for local women. In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E

Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for <b>working</b> <b>mothers.</b> With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study {{sets out to}} examine the identities of a Taiwanese woman in the 21 st century. Adopting the case study as a research strategy, I probe into a <b>working</b> <b>mother’s</b> life story to understand firstly a Taiwanese <b>working</b> <b>mother’s</b> perspectives on her family roles as a wife, mother and daughter-in-law. Secondly, I investigate how social institutions, which transmit different and often-conflicting Confucian and non-Confucian “gender discourses” influence her identities. This thesis adopts narrative interviews as the major method to probe into the life story of a Taiwanese <b>working</b> <b>mother.</b> The dimensions of domestic work and childcare, verbal communication, marital sex and looking after parents-in-law are examined {{in order to understand}} how she has taken on gender discourses and developed identities through her contact with different social institutions. Informed by post-structuralism and feminist theories, I consider the Taiwanese <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> as an individual who has “agency”, meaning she recognizes and values her ability to use and integrate gender discourses into her sense of self through the process of self-attribution. My research results found that “differentiation” “reflection” and “reflexivity” are themes that play important roles in affecting how a Taiwanese <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> perceives herself as an individual and defines her social and family roles. The findings also show that a <b>working</b> <b>mother</b> is able to negotiate different gender discourses. Despite the influence of the Taiwanese Confucian gendered binary, her interactions with different social institutions, especially her native family, counselling services and women’s self-help groups, enable her to develop a sense of “who I am”. She is able to reflect on her life experiences and perceive gender discourses in a critical manner and thus take on gender discourses that she identifies with to develop her own identities...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{the career}} gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity {{in terms of}} their {{domestic}} work and care work. Women in the developed world, including the U.S., still do hours more of housework than their male counterparts, despite their success in the workplace. <b>Working</b> <b>mothers</b> on average do more work and sleep less than their husbands.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. <b>Working</b> <b>mothers</b> are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children.

They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E

25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} meant that <b>working</b> <b>mothers</b> needed access to childcare. In anticipation of mothers in {{the workforce}}, the Federal Minister of Labour was empowered to enter into agreements {{for the establishment of}} daycare facilities for the children of mothers working in war industries. From 1942 to 1946, the Dominion-Provincial Wartime Agreement allowed for subsidized day nursery care for mothers working in essential wartime industries. Provinces that were most industrialized, such as Ontario and Quebec, saw a growing demand for this type of service and took advantage of this agreement to establish their own standards and regulations. This program provided aid to mothers working in war industries; however, it placed strict limitations similar services for women with young children in other work sectors. These wartime day nurseries boasted organized play, frequent outings and other features that would become early childhood education. In June 1946, with the war in Europe over, Federal funding for day nurseries was pulled and the majority of day nurseries were closed. However, some municipalities continued offering day care services and made up the shortfall.|$|E
