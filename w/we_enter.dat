25|$|The {{threshold}} {{points are}} difficult to locate, because the Earth System is very complex. Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range {{is defined as the}} boundary. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> into a danger zone.|$|E

500|$|The Pentecostal Holiness Church {{believes}} {{that no amount}} of good works can achieve justification or salvation. This is achieved only [...] "on the basis of our faith in the shed blood, the resurrection, and the justifying righteousness" [...] of Christ. Good works, however, are a product of salvation. [...] "When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior, our sins are pardoned, we are justified, and <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> a state of righteousness, not our own, but His, both imputed and imparted".|$|E

500|$|Megan Aldrich {{contends that}} Burges's {{interiors}} at Cardiff have [...] "rarely [...] equalled, [...] he executed few buildings as his rich fantastic gothic required equally rich patrons (..) his finished works are outstanding monuments to nineteenth century gothic", the suites of rooms he created at Cardiff being amongst [...] "the most magnificent that the gothic revival ever achieved." [...] Crook goes further still, {{arguing that the}} rooms reach beyond architecture to create [...] "three dimensional passports to fairy kingdoms and realms of gold. In Cardiff Castle <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> a land of dreams".|$|E
500|$|Hann {{says that}} when writers deal with [...] "upmarket" [...] readership, they [...] "need {{to be able to}} justify your coverage, and that [...] thinkpieces hailing the {{cultural}} significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'" [...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 2010, the fortieth {{anniversary of}} Orr scoring the game-winning goal against the St. Louis Blues in {{overtime}} to clinch the 1970 Stanley Cup, the Bruins commemorated the event with a bronze statue of Orr outside the TD Garden, the Bruins' home rink. The statue depicts Orr sprawled in mid-flight after scoring the goal. The unveiling {{was attended by}} many of Orr's past teammates. Orr spoke at the unveiling: [...] "This specific moment and time we celebrate with this statue is something we can all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> Boston Garden. To all of you, {{thank you very much}} {{from the bottom of my}} heart. I'm honoured. Guys, thank you." [...] In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.|$|E

500|$|... "As <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the {{dog days}} of summer, {{we get the}} summer movie season dregs as well," [...] wrote PopMatters editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013. The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, some reviewers found Jawss {{description}} of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the [...] "characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary", the shark [...] "is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity." [...] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the [...] "strong plot" [...] and [...] "rich thematic substructure." [...] The Washington Posts Robert F. Jones described Jaws as [...] "much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study," [...] which [...] "forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the water." [...] New York Magazine reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel [...] "immensely readable" [...] {{despite the lack of}} [...] "memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley [...] "fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to make us feel good, and tops it off with a really terrific and grisly battle scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{money from}} ABC was {{contingent}} on Disney television programs. The studio {{had been involved}} in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland. Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, he wrote that [...] "television can be a most powerful selling aid for us, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise that <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> television when we do". In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%. In April 1955, Newsweek called the series an [...] "American institution". ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show catering specifically to children. The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show). One of the segments of Disneyland consisted of the five-part miniseries Davy Crockett which, according to Gabler, [...] "became an overnight sensation". The show's theme song, [...] "The Ballad of Davy Crockett", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold. As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, Disneyland Records.|$|E

2500|$|American Motors was not {{actively}} involved in auto racing during the early 1960s as not to glamorize corporate sponsorship of activities that promote dangerous speeds and driving. It continued to support the 1957 Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) prohibition on automobile racing. The automaker ran national advertisements: [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> high-performance Rambler V-8s in racing? Because the only race Rambler cares about is the human race." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 327 V8 {{would have}} been quite an {{addition}} to the Nash Healey. The Automobile Manufacturers Association eventually instituted limits on automakers sponsorship of activities that glamorize speed and performance in 1957. American Motors observed both the letter and spirit of AMA's resolution, avoided the auto industry's horsepower race by offering ever more powerful engines. In 1962, American Motors even adopted the advertising slogan, [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> high-performance Rambler V-8s in racing? Because the only race Rambler cares about is the human race!" [...] The automaker focused on its successful compact Rambler American line, midsize Rambler, and luxury oriented Ambassador.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 September, German High Command {{considered}} how {{to destroy}} Leningrad. Occupying {{the city was}} ruled out [...] "because it would make us responsible for food supply".

[...] "Early next year <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> the city (if the Finns do it first we do not object), lead those still alive into inner Russia or into captivity, wipe Leningrad {{from the face of}} the earth through demolitions, and hand the area north of the Neva to the Finns."
