5|$|In contrast, {{there was}} no state land {{adjoining}} the Church. It <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> low density housing area and thus did not provide the same developmental potential as the temple property.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} house <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> deer park. In the 1550s William Clifton took action, in the Star Chamber court, against local poachers who hunted {{deer in the}} park while he was away.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, the City proper—the area bounded by the City {{wall and the}} River Thames—was {{only a part of}} London, {{covering}} some , and home to about 80,000 people, or one sixth of London's inhabitants. The City <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived. The City was then, as now, the commercial heart of the capital, and was the largest market and busiest port in England, dominated by the trading and manufacturing classes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{virus is}} {{approximately}} 122–180 nm {{in diameter and}} is composed of a double helix of DNA which contains about 172,000 base pairs and 85 genes. The DNA <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> protein nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tegument made of protein, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> [...] envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins which are essential to infection of the host cell.|$|R

5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War the {{majority}} of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud's actions gave E Company {{time and}} warning to blunt the Chinese offensive, {{eventually}} repelling the attack. His actions are also credited with allowing his company to evacuate several others {{wounded in the}} attack. When members of the 2nd Battalion returned to the hill and arrived at Red Cloud's position to recover his body the next morning, they found it <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large number of dead Chinese troops.|$|E

5|$|The Great Circle <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{ditch and}} is {{accompanied}} by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also {{a group of three}} stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} {{the middle of}} the fort, which is divided by a sloping ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands {{to the right of the}} ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E

5|$|Nallur, {{the capital}} was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples {{at the four}} gateways. The rebuilt temples that exist now do not match their {{original}} locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by the Portuguese. The {{center of the city}} was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> square fortification around it. There were courtly buildings for the Kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers and other service providers. The old Nallur Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls. In general, the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 {{on the site of}} an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> manor which included mills for corn and fulling, lime kilns and coal mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache {{territory and}} reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified. One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac {{was said to have}} been at war with the unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.|$|E

5|$|The keep <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{curtain wall}} with {{probably}} four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting {{a relatively small}} bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought {{from as far away}} as Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The new fort {{was built}} as an {{extension}} to the north-west of the existing battery, and thus took an irregular plan. The rampart was extended to accommodate more guns – a total of seventeen 32-pdrs. – and a much enlarged interior replaced the old barracks and magazine. Caponiers at the east side and firing positions on the other sides facilitated musketry defence against land-based assailants. The fort <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> wide water-filled ditch. A bridge on the west (landward) side provided the only access route.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} on the Wirral has identified a possible landing site for the Norse and Scots. This is a feature called Wallasey Pool. This is {{in the north of}} the Wirral near the River Mersey. The pool is linked to the river by a creek which, before it was developed into modern docks, stretched inland some two miles, was, at high tide over 20 feet deep and <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> moss or mere which is now known as Bidston Moss. In addition to this landing site a Roman Road leads from the area of Bidston to Chester. Following the route of this road would take an invading force through the area the battle {{is believed to have been}} fought. Landscape survey has identified a likely position for Bruna's burh. This survey places the burh at Brimstage approximately 11 miles from Chester.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The show's seven matches showcased {{prominent}} WWE wrestlers, {{who acted}} out the franchise's stories {{in and out}} of the ring. The main event featured SmackDown wrestlers in a Hell in a Cell match, in which the ring <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> roofed steel structure. In this match, World Heavyweight Champion Batista defeated The Undertaker to retain his title. In Raw's main match, Randy Orton defeated Shawn Michaels in a singles match, while in ECW's prime match, ECW Champion CM Punk defeated John Morrison and The Miz in a Triple Threat match to retain the title. Two matches were on the undercard. The first was a singles match, in which The Great Khali defeated Hornswoggle. The other featured Team Triple H (Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Rey Mysterio, and Kane) defeating Team Umaga (Umaga, Mr. Kennedy, Montel Vontavious Porter, Finlay, and Big Daddy V) in an inter-brand five-on-four Survivor Series elimination tag team match.|$|E
