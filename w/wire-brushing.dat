50|$|Many {{graffiti}} removal methods involve abrasive processes (<b>wire-brushing,</b> grit blasting, etc.) {{or the use}} {{of powerful}} and potentially hazardous chemical solvents, which may damage historic fabric such as the stone facade of a historic building. Laser cleaning (using lasers of the Nd:YAG wavelength), although more expensive, is likely to be more appropriate for historic stonework. Some chemical cleaning agents can also be used with an inert poultice material, in which case the chemical is usually applied first to dissolve the pigment, followed by the poultice to draw the pigment in solution out of the substrate. Removal of graffiti from historic surfaces and objects should only be undertaken by appropriately trained and skilled personnel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional <b>wire-brushing</b> with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.|$|E

The tests described include: (1) fatigue tests on spot-welded lap joints in sheets of unequal thickness of alclad 24 s-t. These tests indicate that the fatigue strength of a spot-welded joint in sheets of two different gages is slightly higher than that of a similar joint in two sheets of the thinner gage but definitely lower than that of a similar joint in two sheets of the thicker gage. (2) Fatigue tests on spot-welded alclad 75 s-t spot-welded lap-joint specimens of alclad 75 s-t were not any stronger in fatigue than similar specimens of alclad 24 s-t. (3) Fatigue tests on lap-joint specimens spot -welded after various surface preparations [...] these included ac welding <b>wire-brushed</b> surfaces, dc welding <b>wire-brushed</b> surfaces, and dc welding chemically cleaned surfaces. While the ac welds were strongest statically, the dc welds on <b>wire-brushed</b> surfaces were strongest in fatigue. Specimens prepared in this way were very nearly as strong as the best riveted specimens tested for comparison. (4) Fatigue tests on specimens spot-welded with varying voltage so as to include a wide range of static spot-weld strengths.

40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} {{is a new}} method to produce ultrafine grain materials with enhanced mechanical properties. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether accumulative roll bonding (ARB) is an effective grain refinement technique for two engineering materials of pure copper and interstitial free (IF) steel strips. Additionally, the influence of severely {{plastic deformation}} imposed by ARB on the mechanical properties of these materials with different crystallographic structure is taken into account.

Findings: The results of the experimental investigations of technological capabilities of four types of Levitation Tool Modules (LTM) have been presented. The optimal design and technological parameters of the modules have been established to control {{the characteristics of the}} surface layer quality. We have developed and experimentally investigated LTM for high-speed <b>wire-brushing</b> of materials. The possibility of ensuring the part surface quality by transportation of various lubricating and cooling technological means in the treatment zone was examined. The procedure for managing microgeometry of the machined surface of holes based on LTM technology and FARCP was studied. During experimental studies the LTM anti-vibration properties were assessed. In addition to controlling the process of part surface coat formation discussed the possibility of increasing efficiency of tools through the use of levitation tool modules. The presented experimental results suggest a high efficiency and expediency of applying LTM for technological quality assurance of the surface layer of parts. Applications/Improvements: The use of aggregated modular levitation devices will reduce the spread of surface quality parameters on average by 2 - 3 times and increase the machining quality through adaptive control of LTM based on the stabilization of the energy characteristics of the process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ultra high {{performance}} fiber concrete (UHPFC) is an advanced formula concrete that {{is proven to}} be more superior than conventional concrete because it embrace the qualities of steel and concrete. Therefore UHPFC properties which include high durability and strength are fully exploited in the research of rehabilitation and strengthening in concrete and even non-concrete structures. This article presents the findings of an experimental study carried out to examine the bonding strength behaviour between normal concrete (NC) substrate and UHPFC as a repair material, under flexural strength test by using third-point loading beam test method. Three types of NC substrate surface preparation were used: as-cast (without surface preparation) as a reference, <b>wire-brushed,</b> and sand-blasted. The flexural test results clearly indicated that all failures occurred through the NC substrate and no de-bonding was observed in the interface between NC substrate and UHPFC. The results of the flexural strength confirmed that adhesion bond strength between NC substrate and UHPFC was stronger than the substrate regardless, the substrate roughness. This proves that UHPFC is able to link and bond strongly with the substrate. The deterioration of reinforced concrete structures is a major social problem. To minimize thi...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{spray coating}} is usually applied through {{directing}} molten or softened particles {{at very high}} velocities onto a substrate. An eddy current non-destructive inspection technique is presented here for thermal spray coating interface quality characterization. Several high-velocity-oxy-fuel (HVOF) coated steel plates were produced with different surface preparation conditions before applying the coating, e. g., grit-blasted surface, <b>wire-brush</b> cleaned surface, and a dirty surface. A quad-frequency eddy current probe was used to manually scan over the coating surface to evaluate the bonding quality. Experimental {{results show that the}} three surface preparation conditions can be successfully differentiated by looking into the impedance difference observed from the eddy current probe. The measurement is fairly robust and consistent. More specimens are also prepared with variations of process parameters, such as spray angle, stand-off distance, and application of corrosion protective sealant, etc. They are blindly tested to evaluate the reliability of the eddy current system. Quantitative relations between the coating bond strength and the eddy current response are also established with the support of destructive testing. This non-contact, non-destructive, easy to use technique has the potential for evaluating the coating quality immediately after its application so that any defects can be corrected immediately...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of 22 types and sizes of wires for potential use in <b>wire-brush</b> skids were studied. These characteristics {{were determined by}} placing brushes made from candidate wires on a belt sander whose moving belt simulated landing roll-out distance. At the same time, the drag force and wear behavior were monitored. Data were obtained over distances up to 3048 m (10, 000 ft) at preselected bearing pressures of 172 to 1034 kPa (25 to 150 psi). In general, the friction coefficient developed by the candidate wires {{was found to be}} independent of bearing pressure and ranged between 0. 4 and 0. 6 under the test conditions of this investigation. The friction coefficient was not degraded when the surface was wetted and appears to be independent of wire diameter except perhaps when wire size is relatively large compared with the surface asperities. Generally, the high friction demonstrated by the soft materials was accompanied by high wear rates; conversely, the hard materials provided greater wear resistance but offered lower friction. For all test wires, the wear was shown to increase with increasing bearing pressure, in general, for the same bearing pressure, wear increased with increasing wire diameter and decreased when the surface was wetted...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{concrete}} {{consists of}} two elements cast at different times which are the concrete base and concrete topping. To achieve composite action, interface shear strength must be sufficient to resist the sliding motion between the two concrete surfaces in contact. The interface shear strength is mainly depended on concrete cohesion, friction and dowel action. A total of 36 “push-off” tests were performed to study the interface shear strength and to assess the influence of surface texture and steel reinforcement crossing the interface. Three different concrete base surfaces are prepared which include smooth or “left as-cast”, roughened by <b>wire-brushing</b> in the transverse direction and steel reinforcement projecting from the concrete base. Eurocode 2 provides design equations for determining the interface shear strength with different surface textures and also the one where projecting steel reinforcement crosses the interface. The experimental {{results show that the}} transverse roughened surface produced the highest interface shear strength of 1. 89 N/mm 2 (sn = 0 N/mm 2), 4. 69 N/mm 2 (sn = 0. 5 N/mm 2), 5. 97 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 0 N/mm 2) and 6. 42 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 5 N/mm 2) compared with the other surface textures. This proves that the increase in the degree of roughness contributes to higher concrete cohesion and friction coefficient. However, for the surface with projecting steel reinforcement, the failure is not sudden as experienced by the surface without one. This is due to the contribution of the clamping stress from the dowel action of the steel reinforcements. Meanwhile, for specimens without any projecting steel reinforcements, the interface shear strength depended solely on friction and concrete cohesion of the surface textures. The interface shear strength of surface with and without the projecting steel reinforcement can be predicted using the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. This paper also proposed design expressions for concrete-to-concrete bond on surfaces provided with and without projecting steel reinforcement that can be adopted in Eurocode 2...|$|E
40|$|Hydrologic {{information}} {{is essential for}} environmental efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Testing at new characterization wells being drilled to the regional aquifer (''R wells'') to improve the conceptual hydrogeologic model of the Pajarito Plateau is providing such information. Drilling has been by air-rotary casing-advance or open-hole methods. Most wells are completed with multiple screens. After their construction, wells were rigorously developed by <b>wire-brushing,</b> bailing, followed by surging, swabbing, or jetting, and finally by pumping. These methods are effective based on field-parameter measurements and comparison of results of hydrologic testing at well R- 31 before and after complete well development. We conducted field tests on various zones of saturation penetrated by the R wells to collect data needed for determining hydraulic properties. This document provides details of the design and execution of testing {{as well as an}} analysis of data for five of the new wells: R- 9 i, R- 13, R- 19, R- 22, and R- 31. One well was evaluated by a pumping test (R- 13), another was evaluated by both straddle-packer/injection and pumping tests (R- 9 i), and the rest were evaluated by injection tests alone (R- 19, R- 22, R- 31). Testing was constrained by the regional setting (complex geology and multiple zones of saturation) and well construction (multiscreen completion and the small diameter of the production casing). Packers are required for testing multiscreen wells. The small diameter of the production casing not only precludes the use of a slugger but also limits the capacity of pumps {{that can be used in}} testing, especially for the depths involved in the R wells. For example, pumping at a maximum rate of 19 gallons per minute did not significantly stress the regional aquifer at R- 13. Although not slug tests, the injection tests are comparable in several ways, and analysis of data by slugtest methods is appropriate. Despite constraints, the results obtained appear valid based on (1) the care taken during test implementation and data analysis, (2) comparison of results for initial and repeated tests obtained by the same analytical method, (3) comparison of results obtained for a given test by different analytical methods, (4) comparison of results with values determined by geophysical logging in the wells and pumping tests of the same geologic units elsewhere on the plateau, and (5) comparison with hydraulic properties commonly reported for similar geologic materials outside the area. Significant contributions of this report are not only the documentation of test design, implementation, and analysis but also a comprehensive table showing the distribution of hydraulic properties for the saturated geologic units tested beneath the Pajarito Plateau. We also offer several recommendations based on testing to date. Placing screens across the water table and geologic contacts as well as employing oversized filter packs hinders testing and should be avoided. In addition, we recommend that future testing include some alternative designs and methods. Multiple methods and routine repeat testing for a given screened interval would permit comparison of results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Microstructural {{evolution}} in the thickness direction of an oxygen free copper processed by accumulative roll-bonding (ARB) is investigated by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) measurement. For the ARB, two copper alloy sheets 1 mm thick, 30 mm wide and 300 mm long are first degreased and <b>wire-brushed</b> for sound bonding. The sheets are then stacked and roll-bonded by about 50 % reduction rolling without lubrication at an ambient temperature. The bonded sheet is then cut to the two pieces of the same dimensions and the same procedure was repeated on the sheets up to eight cycles. The specimen after 1 cycle showed inhomogeneous microstructure in the thickness direction so that the grains near the surface were finer than those near the center. This inhomogeneity decreased with {{an increasing number of}} ARB cycles, and the grain sizes of the specimens after 3 cycles were almost identical. In addition, the aspect ratio of the grains decreased with an increasing number of ARB cycles due to the subdivision of the grains by shear deformation. The fraction of grains with high angle grain boundaries also increased with continuing process of the ARB so that it was higher than that of the low angle grain boundaries in specimens after 3 cycles. A discontinuous dynamic recrystallization occurred partially in specimens after 5 cycles...|$|R
40|$|The inverse-pinch plasma switch was studied using a {{computer}} simulation code. The code {{was based on a}} 2 -D, 2 -temperature magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The application of this code was limited to the disk-type inverse-pinch plasma switch. The results of the computer analysis appear to be in agreement with the experimental results when the same parameters are used. An inverse-pinch plasma switch for closing has been designed and tested for high-power switching requirements. An azimuthally uniform initiation of breakdown is a key factor in achieving an inverse-pinch current path in the switch. Thus, various types of triggers, such as trigger pins, <b>wire-brush,</b> ring trigger, and hypocycloidal-pinch (HCP) devices have been tested for uniform breakdown. Recently, triggering was achieved by injection of a plasma-ring (plasma puff) that is produced separately with hypocycloidal-pinch electrodes placed under the cathode of the main gap. The current paths at switch closing, initiated by the injection of a plasma-ring from the HCP trigger are azimuthally uniform, and the local current density is significantly reduced, so that damage to the electrodes and the insulator surfaces is minimized. The test results indicate that electron bombardment on the electrodes and the insulator surfaces is minimized. The test results indicate that electron bombardment on the electrodes is four orders of magnitude less than that of a spark-gap switch for the same switching power. Indeed, a few thousand shots with peak current exceeding a mega-ampere and with hold-off voltage up to 20 kV have been conducted without showing measurable damage to the electrodes and insulators...|$|R
