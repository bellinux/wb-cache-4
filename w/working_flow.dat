The upper canal design included 20 dams and 29 locks, {{and a variety of}} reservoirs to provide <b>working</b> <b>flow</b> even in dry summers was constructed, covering a difference in elevation of over 600 ft to the Mauch Chunk slack water pool. Unlike the lower canal with a maximum lift less than 20', the upper canal had locks lifting a maximum of 58 ft. This is comparable to the lift of the lower canal in a bit over half the distance using less than 11/18ths as many locks per mile. The LC&N Co. began work on the upper canal in 1835, which like construction of the lower, required work parties camping in the wilderness miles from the nearest road, village, or railroad. [...] The upper Lehigh Canal was designed by Canvass White, an engineer of New York's Erie Canal, and was constructed between 1837 and 1843, as authorized by the 1837 revision of the Main Line of Public Works. Unlike the lower canal where most locks lifted less than six feet in easy elevation stages, the upper canal design had a greater reliance on deep lift locks. The upper Lehigh was a twisty rapids strewn watercourse with steep sides, a large part of which was located in a ravine, the Lehigh Gorge. The village of White Haven, PA is at {{the upper end of the}} navigation, and inspired by the successful working of freight over the Allegheny Front escarpment via the Allegheny Portage Railroad system, in the mid-1830s the business community and the legislature sought to more effectively connect the vast coal deposits of the Wyoming Valley to the Delaware basin cities, noted above. [...] The project included four major construction hurdles and three new railroad projects, for which LC&N created a new subsidiary, the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S) to implement; north to south these were: ...|$|E

Three issues were explored: (a) whether hospital financial ratio groups differed from industrial firm financial ratio groups found in previous studies; (b) whether hospital financial ratio groups remained stable {{over a five-year period}} 1983 – 1987; and (c) whether there was a difference between <b>working</b> capital <b>flow,</b> cash flow, and net income plus depreciation as alternative hospital asset flow measures. The results of our study confirmed the existence of five hospital ratio groups that were identical to industrial ratio groups.

And unlike studies on industrial firms, Return On Equity and Working Capital Flow emerged as two distinctly independent financial ratio groups. Furthermore, the Cash Flow ratios did not differ consistently from their surrogate measures—the Net Income Plus Depreciation ratios. Our study provided evidence to suggest that analysts should pay closer attention to two aspects of hospital financial performance: (a) hospital equity in relationship to total assets, net income, <b>working</b> capital <b>flow,</b> and cash flow; and (b) hospital <b>working</b> capital <b>flow</b> as a separate aspect of hospital asset flow rather than just cash flow and/or net income plus depreciation.
