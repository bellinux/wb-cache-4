For the alarm to be effective, the child must awaken or be awakened as soon as the alarm goes off. This may require having another person sleep in the same room to awaken the bedwetter. Bed-wetting alarms have been around since 1938, when O. H. Mowrer and W. M. Mowrer first invented the [...] "bell and pad".

50|$|New Space was {{dedicated}} to four artists: Timothy Drever, Ed Herring, Peter Joseph and David Parsons. Herring made another installation in the garden. At {{the time of the}} catalogue going to print the work was called Proposal for Work in a Public Open Space, which Herring later called Chemical Boxes. It comprised 20 specially prepared boxes, metal-lined and filled with different <b>water-sensitive</b> chemicals. They were arranged in rows, before being buried. The boxes in each row were connected with each other by small pipes. At the top end of each row was an area for collecting rain water, which was fed it into the boxes. The aim was to let rain water infiltrate the boxes and create a chemical reaction. The finished result, being buried underneath the lawn, was invisible to the public. Hence a follow-up exhibition, called Sequel, took place at Swiss Cottage Library, London in 1970. Herring exhibited the chemical reactions in the original boxes, once unearthed, revealing a striking range of colours and patterns. It was the actual process that was important and not the finished results.|$|E
50|$|The Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme was {{launched}} in 2006 to transform the country’s water bodies beyond their functions of drainage and water supply into beautiful and clean rivers and lakes with new spaces for community bonding and recreation.

A long-term initiative, over 100 locations have been identified for project implementation in phases by 2030, with 20 projects already completed, bringing people closer to water. ABC Waters @ Kallang River - Bishan Park is one of the flagship projects under this programme. The park was due for major refurbishment and the Kallang River {{in the form of a}} concrete channel along the park edges was also due for upgrading to cater to increased rainwater runoff from the catchment due to urbanisation. Plans were thus made to carry out redevelopment works together, transforming Kallang River from a linear utilitarian concrete drainage channel into a meandering, natural river through the park.|$|E

These can range from seeing all forms of water as a resource, exploiting opportunities to contribute to the green and blue infrastructure agendas, resilience to climate and other changes. This paper draws on international experience as to how <b>water-sensitive</b> urban design can deliver opportunities; mitigate the urban development challenges; implement and support institutional, regulatory and practical opportunities and demonstrate the benefits of taking a <b>water-sensitive</b> urban design approach in the UK.

40|$|Across the {{academic}} sphere, much {{research has been}} conducted into the development of <b>water-sensitive</b> elements to address issues around urban water management. However, these elements are commonly investigated in isolation, with little consideration for initiatives from other disciplines that may support their success. This research aims to demonstrate the value that an architect may bring in incorporating ideas drawn from various disciplines to create a water- sensitive design solution with multiple ecosystem benefits, taking into account the human experience of space and place-making. In doing so, the design demonstrates that a <b>water-sensitive</b> building is aesthetically pleasing, viable and achievable. The feasibility of <b>water-sensitive</b> designs has been noted as a focus area by the South African Water Research Commission; one which is particularly pertinent in our present water-scarce environment in South Africa. This applied study is based on a previous Master of Architecture (Professional) dissertation building design, which is used as the unit of analysis. The building focuses on restoring the quality of water in the Liesbeek River in Cape Town using passive filtration methods. The objective {{of this study is to}} gain new insights into the design process and planning of <b>water-sensitive</b> architectural buildings, which assists in understanding when collaborating across disciplines. The research is guided by Deep Ecology, phenomenology and Ecological Urbanism. Research by Design is used as the method of the study, in which different design iterations based on the raw data of the original building are investigated and analysed, as well as evaluated by specialists from various disciplines in order to create a best-fit design solution. The revised building takes into account the practical, site-specific and architectural qualities of a <b>water-sensitive</b> design to create a people-centred building that incorporates ecological and engineering demands in greater detail. Key outcomes of the study include a typical design process for a WSAD and architectural guidelines for <b>water-sensitive</b> buildings, grounded in the diverse values of water and its relationship to people and nature. The dissertation aims to contribute to {{the academic}} discourse around <b>water-sensitive</b> design. Further, the guidelines developed may be used to inform the design of conventional buildings...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study used}} an image {{processing}} method to analyze spray depositions on <b>water-sensitive</b> paper. A Scanner was used to transfer the image deposited on <b>water-sensitive</b> paper in this system. To measure {{the efficiency of the}} spray machine, water- sensitive paper analysis is the simplesu method. This study used <b>water-sensitive</b> paper to collect the spray depositions and a scanner to digitize the spray depositions into image information. Image processing was then applied to analyze the depositions, and threshold was used to segment the object from the background. Labeling was used to count the number of droplets. Using image processing we can determine droplet size distribution,coverage density, and the percentage of the coverage. The result of this study revealed that the image processing algorithms were used to extract deposit features and measure the target area covered by the deposits. The percent area covered as measured by image analysis decreased as spray high or spray speed increased or hydraulic pressure decreased. The advantages of image processing techniques applied to analyze spray deposition are increasing the speed of analysis and reducing the labor involved. In addition, {{image processing method}}s can describe the spray deposition, quantify feature terms. 摘 要 本研究是利用影像處理技術來分析研究噴霧沉積在水試紙上的分佈情形， 並以影像掃描器作為取像設備的分析研究系統。水試紙最常被作為噴霧效 果的檢測方式，本研究方法是利用水試紙來收集噴霧沉積後，利用影像掃 描器將霧粒的沉積分佈情形數位化成影像資料。然後應用影像處理技術以 分析影像資料。影像處理過程包括使用分界值法來進行霧粒與水試紙背景 的分割與利用標記法來計算霧粒影像的數目。接著便可利用影像處理所得 到的數值以求得霧粒粒徑分佈範圍、霧粒沉積密度、霧粒覆蓋率等參數。 實驗結果顯示，噴霧沉積覆蓋率會隨著液體壓力的增加而增加，且會隨著 噴灑高度及噴霧行進速度的增加而減少。利用影像技術來分析噴霧沉積的 情形不但精確、快速、節省大量的人工操作勞力和時間，更可以數值及影 像描述噴霧沉積情形...|$|E
