5|$|I went to New York and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the studio}} {{and came to a}} break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert McComb, {{the home}} {{inspired}} his famous brother, who loved the house:The {{house was the}} home of the band while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Perth. The sprawling rooms, lofts and underground cellars we used to rehearse in were things most Perth houses didn't have; there was such a strong atmosphere there that Dave would return to it for inspiration.|$|E

In the interim <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> constant consultation {{with a lawyer}} and other officials about local customs and regulations. Friday midday, his meditation ended and his mind separated from his body. Within hours, his appearance changed. He took on the signs typical of those occurring within the first 24 hours of death.|$|E
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{scenario}} remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:Naïveté {{can also}} be detected in my supposition {{that it would take}} something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell you how reliable <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> our roles as Cassandras.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the {{universe}} of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So we said here’s what’s going to be weird about the world of our movie: No one’s {{going to be over}} 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and then you had Coppola making two high school movies: The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. So Walter said we’re going to make a high school movie that’s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Luzon. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way <b>We</b> <b>Were.</b> <b>In</b> it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E
500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible.

[...] Anak was a biblical figure {{said to be the}} forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|E

[...] The costumes Field designed for that look resulted in numerous blown takes during the montage where Miranda repeatedly throws her overcoat on Andrea's desk when she arrives in the morning.

500|$|After the Beatles were {{introduced}} to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the group attended an August weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales. During the seminar, they were informed of Epstein's death. [...] "I knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> trouble then", Lennon said later. [...] "I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared". Led primarily by Harrison and Lennon's interest in Eastern religion, the Beatles later travelled to Maharishi's ashram in India for further guidance. While there, they composed most of the songs for The Beatles and Abbey Road.|$|E

Many {{of the same}} people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and [...] "queens"—but they were joined by [...] "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: [...] "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the streets." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian".

I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be happy to hear how much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
