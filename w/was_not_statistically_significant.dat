5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

25|$|Several {{very large}} {{observational}} {{studies have also}} found elevated {{risk of heart attack}} from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> and relative risk compared to other populations <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> (Graham, 2005).|$|E

Subjects who took Juice Plus had lower TNF-α levels than the placebo group at later time points in the study (week 16 and 28) but overall the effect <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> Juice Plus {{was found to have}} no significant effect on IL-6 levels or on the incidence of illness {{during the course of the}} study.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-sweetened drinks {{have also}} been speculated to cause weight gain in adults. In one study, {{overweight}} individuals consumed a daily supplement of sucrose-sweetened or artificially sweetened drinks or foods for a 10-week period.

A two-week study had participants supplement their diet with sugar-sweetened soft drinks, artificially sweetened soft drinks, or neither. Although the participants gained the most weight when consuming the sugar-sweetened drinks, some of the differences were unreliable: the differences between men who consumed sugar-sweetened drinks or no drinks <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cabozantinib, {{trade name}} Cometriq, was granted {{marketing}} approval (November 2012) by the U.S. FDA for this indication. Cabozantinib {{which is a}} potent inhibitor of RET, MET and VEGF was evaluated in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. It was shown to improve overall survival by 5 months for the treated cohort vs. placebo, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> However, cabozantinib was particularly effective in patients with the RET M918T mutation, extending overall survival by roughly 2 years, doubling survival vs. untreated patient (4 years vs. 2 year). Treatment with cabozantinib did require many dose reduction to mitigate side effects. It {{has been suggested that}} the trial dose of 140mg was excessive, particularly in lower body mass patients. Ongoing trials have been scheduled to identify more optimal dosing regimes. Activity has been observed, in practice at doeses of 1.2mg/kg.|$|E

2500|$|In another study, {{the data}} on more than 200,000 cases were {{obtained}} from the UK general practice research database. At baseline, patients prescribed venlafaxine had a greater number of risk factors for suicide (such as prior suicide attempts) than patients treated with other anti-depressants. The patients taking venlafaxine had significantly higher risk of completed suicide than the ones on fluoxetine or citalopram (Celexa). [...] After adjusting for known risk factors, venlafaxine was associated with an increased risk of suicide relative to fluoxetine and dothiepin that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> A statistically significant greater risk for attempted suicide remained after adjustment, but the authors concluded that it could be due to residual confounding.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, {{case reports}} started being {{published}} regarding late stent thrombosis.

[...] However, this increase <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> and further data would have to be collected. [...] Further data published over the following year had conflicting results, and it was unclear whether stent thrombosis was truly higher when compared to bare metal stents. [...] During this time of uncertainty, many cardiologists started extending the dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel in these individuals, as some data suggested that it may prevent late thrombosis.|$|E
