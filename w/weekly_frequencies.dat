40|$|Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} {{result in}} the most medical encounters, lost duty days, and service members on permanent disability. Women {{are at greater risk}} of injury than men and physical training {{is the leading cause of}} injury. The purpose of this study is to investigate the demographic, body composition, fitness, and physical training risk factors for injuries in female soldiers serving in operational Army units over the past 12 months. Self-report survey was collected from 625 women. Correlation, chi squared, relative risk, and logistic regression were used to analyze the results. The ankle was the most frequently injured body region, 13 %. Running was the activity most often associated with injury, 34 %. In univariate analysis rank, age, history of deployment, <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> of unit runs, <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> of personal strength training, and history of injury were all associated with injury. Having the rank of private to specialist increased the relative risk (RR) of injury by 68 %, being in the Blue Brigade increased the RR by 48 %, having no history of deployment increased the RR by 48 %, having a history of injury in the last 12 months increase the RR by 160 %, having no weekly unit runs increased the RR by 53 %, having a <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1 - 2 personal weight training sessions increased RR by 42 %, having a run time between 17 and 18 minutes increased RR by 71 %, and having an Army Physical Fitness Score below 290 increased RR at least 70 %. In multivariate analysis rank, history of injury, <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> of unit runs, and <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> of personal strength training were the best combination of predictors of injury in female soldiers. Running once or twice a week with the unit protected against MSI while participating in personal strength training sessions once or twice a week increased the risk of MSI. Fitness was neither protective nor harmful when all other variables were accounted for in the equation. The public health significance is that with a higher emphasis on running and strength training, the US Army could reduce injuries and save billions of dollars in training and healthcare costs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} intertemporal {{relation}} between volatility spreads and expected returns on the aggregate stock market. We {{provide evidence for}} a significantly negative link between volatility spreads and expected returns at the daily and <b>weekly</b> <b>frequencies.</b> We argue that this link {{is driven by the}} information flow from option markets to stock markets. The documented relation is significantly stronger for the periods during which (i) S&P 500 constituent firms announce their earnings; (ii) cash flow and discount rate news are large in magnitude; and (iii) consumer sentiment index takes extreme values. The intertemporal relation remains strongly negative after controlling for conditional volatility, variance risk premium, and macroeconomic variables. Moreover, a trading strategy based on the intertemporal relation with volatility spreads has higher portfolio returns compared to a passive strategy of investing in the S&P 500 index, after transaction costs are taken into account.

40|$|In {{examining}} stochastic {{models for}} commodity prices, central questions often revolve around time-varying trend, stochastic convenience yield and volatility, and mean reversion. This paper seeks {{to assess and}} compare alternative approaches to modelling these effects, with focus on forecast performance. Three specifications are considered: (i) random-walk models with GARCH and normal or Student- t innovations; (ii) Poisson-based jump-diffusion models with GARCH and normal or Student- t innovations; and (iii) mean-reverting models that allow for uncertainty in equilibrium price. Our empirical application makes use of aluminium spot and futures price series at daily and <b>weekly</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Results show: (i) models with stochastic convenience yield outperform all other competing models, and for all forecast horizons; (ii) the use of futures prices does not always yield lower forecast error values {{compared to the use}} of spot prices; and (iii) within the class of (G) ARCH random-walk models, no model uniformly dominates the other.

40|$|Volatility {{forecasting}} in {{an important}} area of research in financial markets and immense effort expended in improving volatility models, since better forecasts will ultimately lead to more accurate options pricing and better risk management. This thesis attempts at modeling and forecasting the volatility of FTSE 100 index return of United Kingdom market, using daily and <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> data range from January 1, 2003 to July 31, 2013. For each return series, the last 60 observations are used as holdout sample for out-of-sample forecast evaluation. The forecasting models that are considered in this study range from the relative simple GARCH (1, 1) model to relatively complex GARCH models, including Exponential GARCH (p, q), Threshold GARCH (p, q) and GJR-GARCH (p, q). The findings present the inappropriateness of the asymmetric TGARCH and GJR models in modeling FTSE 100 index return volatility. The results based on out-of-sample forecasts provide evidence of superiority of GARCH (1, 1) in forecasting conditional volatility of daily frequency returns while the asymmetric EGARCH (1, 1) does perform better in forecasting volatility of <b>weekly</b> <b>frequency</b> returns. The findings are evidenced by three different error measurements to evaluate the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. Moreover, this thesis also detects the risk-reward relation in the FTSE 100 index returns by GARCH-M model. The results suggest such relationship is positive but statically insignificant...|$|R

Fifty-nine children who had failed standard medical management for retentive encopresis and their parents partici-pated in six 1 -hour group treatment sessions.
