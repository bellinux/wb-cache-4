5000|$|However, {{there are}} many {{differences}} between the two. The Wankel engine working chamber is mobile while the RKM chamber is stationary. The axis of rotation in the Wankel engine moves in a circle while that of the RKM is fixed (in the single power shaft version, temporarily with two possible positions). In the RKM motor, the ignition {{takes place in a}} compact recess, while the Wankel's is in the <b>work</b> <b>chamber</b> itself. The RKM's sealing elements are in surface contact with the <b>work</b> <b>chamber</b> and pistons, as opposed to the Wankel's line contact.

30|$|ZnO {{thin films}} have been grown by {{different}} methods including {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD), magnetron sputtering, spray pyrolysis, pulsed laser deposition, chemical beam deposition, and evaporation [15 – 21]. However, the evaporating method is perhaps the cleanest of the entire nanoceramic synthesis route in a well-controlled atmosphere within a <b>work</b> <b>chamber.</b> On the other hand, the need to evaporate in a low-pressure environment translated directly to <b>work</b> <b>chamber.</b> Thermal evaporation is relatively simple and a low-cost technique {{that can be applied}} to low melting point, low decomposition, or low sublimation point oxides [22].

Several supporting studies were conducted to define specific chamber requirements, to determine the sensitivity of the measurement techniques to be incorporated in the chamber, and to establish procedures for handling samples prior to their installation in the chamber.

30|$|After Successive {{improvements}} like {{increasing the}} speed of search process with good intelligence, without trapping at local minimum, powerful and widely accepted biologically inspired algorithm of Genetic Algorithm has been proposed by John Hallond in 1975 and finally it has been popularized {{by one of his}} student Goldberg who has solved the complex problem of control of gas-pipe line transmission for his dissertation <b>work</b> (<b>Chamber</b> 1995). Later it has been successfully implemented for solving number of engineering optimization problems due to the advantages such as Optimization with continuous or discrete variables, no need of calculus information, capability of dealing with a large number of variables, well suited for parallel computers, ability to find optimum global minimum instead of local minimum even in most complex objective functions (Sivanandam & Deepa 2011); (Deb 2001).|$|E

40|$|Context: Adiponectin {{inhibits}} {{protein synthesis}} in cardiac myocytes, thereby opposing {{the effect of}} cardiac workload and trophic factors (in particular, insulin) on left ventricular (LV) mass and wall thickness (WT). Objective: We tested whether adiponectin and its isoforms are related to LVmass, WT, and function independently of metabolic factors. Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Subjects: The study included 77 healthy volunteers (42 men) aged 30 - 59 yr with normal LV structure and function. Main Outcome Measures: Insulin response and insulin sensitivity were assessed by oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. LV mass, WT, stroke <b>work,</b> <b>chamber</b> function, and myocardial longitudinal function were evaluated by standard Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging. Total and molecular isoforms of adiponectin were measured in plasma. Results: By multivariate analysis, independent factors affecting LV mass were sex, body mass index, stroke work, and current smoking (R- 2 = 0. 66). Independent correlates of LV WT were age, stroke work, and plasma adiponectin (standardized r = 0. 28, 0. 41, and - 0. 26, P at least < 0. 005, R- 2 = 0. 48). LV longitudinal late diastolic velocity was independently related to age, body mass index, and adiponectin (standardized r = 0. 20, 0. 26, - 0. 33, P at least < 0. 05,R- 2 = 0. 30). High-molecular-weight adiponectin (47 % of total), but not lower molecular-weight isoforms, insulin sensitivity, or other metabolic factors, was inversely and independently related to WT (standardized r = - 0. 27, P < 0. 01) and myocardial longitudinal late diastolic velocity (standardized r = - 0. 28, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In healthy subjects, circulating total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin are related to LV WT and diastolic function, independently of age and metabolic factors...|$|E
