5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E

5|$|The {{theme of}} Shiva as a beggar {{is not unique}} to the Bhikshatana icon and his legends. Shiva is often {{described}} as <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> universe as a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's raison d'être being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E

5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved.

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|His second film of 1949, also {{produced}} by Film Art Association and released by Shintoho, was Stray Dog. It is a detective movie (perhaps the first important Japanese film in that genre) that explores {{the mood of}} Japan during its painful postwar recovery through {{the story of a}} young detective, played by Mifune, and his fixation on the recovery of his handgun, which was stolen by a penniless war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder. Adapted from an unpublished novel by Kurosawa in the style of a favorite writer of his, Georges Simenon, it was the director's first collaboration with screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima, who would later help to script eight other Kurosawa films. A famous, virtually wordless sequence, lasting over eight minutes, shows the detective, disguised as an impoverished veteran, <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> streets in search of the gun thief; it employed actual documentary footage of war-ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kurosawa's friend, Ishirō Honda, the future director of Godzilla. The film is considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres.|$|E

5|$|The plot of The Legend of Zelda is {{described}} in the instruction booklet and in the short prologue after the title screen. A small kingdom {{in the land of}} Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana narrates {{that during}} a {{particular}} council of rishis (sages), the god Brahma arrogantly {{declared that he}} was the Supreme Creator of the Universe. Shiva appeared at the assembly as an infinite pillar of light and challenged Brahma's statement. After deliberation, the council accepted Shiva as the true Creator, but Brahma remained obstinate. Angered by Brahma's vanity, Shiva—as the terrifying Bhairava—cut off one head of the five-headed Brahma with a mere flick of his fingernail (an act iconographically depicted as Brahmashirascheda-murti). As a consequence Brahma died, but the spiritual credit he had accumulated over a lifetime of devout asceticism pulled him immediately back from death. Upon his resurrection, Brahma accepted Shiva's superiority. The reason for the decapitation of Brahma remains the same in the narratives of the Shiva Purana and the Matsya Purana. In the Skanda Purana, the trigger is not Brahma's arrogance but his incest with his daughter, while in the Bengali version of the Shiva Purana, Brahma insults Shiva using his fifth head's mouth, while the rest of them praise Shiva when he comes to Brahma's abode as a guest. In another instance in the Shiva Purana, when an argument erupts between Brahma and Vishnu over who is superior, Shiva appears as an infinite fiery pillar (Linga) in front of the pair. They decide whoever finds the end of the pillar is superior. Brahma lies about finding the head of the infinite pillar and declares himself as superior. In the Varaha Purana, in which Shiva is born from Brahma's brow, Brahma calls his son a Kapali and angers him. In all versions, an infuriated Shiva or Bhairava cuts off Brahma's head as a punishment. However, all Puranas (Kurma, Varaha, Shiva, Skanda, and Vamana) agree that the head of Brahma stuck to Bhairava-Shiva's left palm due to the sin of killing Brahma, the most learned Brahmin – Brahmahatya or Brahminicide. To expiate the sin of brahmahatya, Shiva had to perform the vow of a Kapali: <b>wandering</b> <b>the</b> world as a naked beggar with the skull of the slain as his begging bowl. In the Kurma and Vamana Puranas, Shiva's sin takes corporeal form, becoming a ghoulish woman called Brahmahatya who follows Bhikshatana everywhere he goes.|$|E
