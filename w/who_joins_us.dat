We fervently hope that the reaser <b>who</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> on this imaginary journey will be inclined to visit the cultural and natural treasures encountered in this book and experience them first hand.

60|$|As we delved up the {{twisting}} road between two fields, {{that leads to}} the farm of Little Rathie, the talk became less general, and another mourner <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> there was told that the farmer was gone.|$|R
6000|$|The King {{was greatly}} shocked.--"Good God!" [...] he said, [...] "the gallant Major Coleby, <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> with his four {{sons and a}} hundred and fifty men at Warrington!--And is this all we could do for an old Worcester friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm waiting your {{orders for}} Timbuctoo, sir," [...] says I, and laughed fit to die; {{and so did}} my Lord Tiptoff and his party, <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> on the lawn: and Jeames the footman came forward and helped Mr. Preston out of the water.|$|R

A fellow <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> at the lagoon gave me a letter for you. Sorry I forgot it until now, but I had a good deal to think about." ...|$|R
6000|$|As for Goff, {{he has a}} huge shining bald forehead, and immense bristling Indian-red whiskers. He wears white wash-leather gloves, drinks fairly, likes a rubber, and has a {{story for}} after dinner, beginning, [...] "Doctor, ye racklackt Sandy M'Lellan, <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in the West Indies. Wal, sir," [...] etc. These and little Cutler made up the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till {{her hair}} be grey!" [...] said Robinson, {{when he was}} left to himself. [...] "Do I wish her to wait? Would I not stand {{with her at the}} altar to-morrow, though my last half-crown should go to the greedy priest <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us?</b> And she has sent her friend to Aldersgate Street,--to my rival! There must, at any rate, be an end of this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the circumstance," [...] Lacy said warmly. [...] "I {{heard it from}} a Saxon officer, <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> {{at the end of}} the first campaign, after the Saxon army was disbanded and the officers were allowed to go free. He was at Dresden for a time, and heard the story. It was a gallant business. I think you killed six of them. And what was the next occasion?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We might, Mike; but {{you must}} {{remember}} that we failed to do so, even when the people were armed. No doubt we shall take {{a certain amount of}} muskets and ammunition with us, but the power of England is more assuredly fixed in Ireland now than it was then--the influence of the old Irish families is broken, and even if we armed all <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> it would be but an armed rabble and not an army.|$|R
5000|$|With {{approximately}} 320 students {{studying for}} their A Levels at LGGS, {{we are a}} flourishing community offering {{a wide range of}} courses. Our Sixth Form is enhanced every year by a large number of students <b>who</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> from other schools; in 2015 we welcomed 64 such students. We have an excellent academic reputation and in 2015, 74% of A Level grades were grades A* to B with 18.5% at A*. This reflects the very high standards of teaching and learning at LGGS." ...|$|R

40|$|This last {{bulletin}} {{before the}} year 2000 provides our regular update on research conducted in the Center.

5000|$|We {{never once}} rehearsed. We did listen intently to one another. Jazz {{is all about}} {{listening}} and sharing. I never drowned out one word of whatever Jack was reading or making up on the spot. When I did my spontaneous scatting ... he would play piano or bongos and he never drowned out or stepped on a word or interrupted a thought that I or anyone else had when they <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in these late night-early morning get-togethers. We had mutual respect for one another, and anyone <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> received the same respect. We almost never used a microphone. Most of the time, there weren't any available! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad {{indeed to}} see you, sirs," [...] Cathelineau said. [...] "You {{are the first}} gentlemen <b>who</b> have <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> here; though I hear that, farther south, some have already {{declared}} themselves. We want you badly.|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment," [...] {{said the}} {{professional}} man indignantly, [...] "there {{is a man}} here whom you have spared,--a man <b>who</b> lately <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Is that man," [...] pointing to the astonished Key, [...] "one of your confederates?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Riverfield began {{a new era}} in August 2002, {{with the}} {{addition}} of a freshman class. The school embarked on the [...] "Spreading Our Wings" [...] capital campaign in order to build facilities to accommodate the growing student body. The campaign was successful, thanks in large part to the generosity of Tulsa philanthropist Genave Rogers. On Visiting Day in November 2004, the Clark Gymnasium and Genave Rogers Upper School were dedicated with the help of Dr. Jane Goodall <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> to dedicate the Science Lab in memory of Tim Oâ€™Halloran, the first Upper School Head.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} several years, the museum played host to many {{historic}} and memorable special events and activities, including [...] "A Walk on the Moon" [...] in 1999 in which seven NASA lunar astronauts were present and honored for their advancement in the discovery of space and the moon. In 2000, the museum held the 60th Commemorative Anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Attendees at this event witnessed first-hand accounts of this epic air battle, live and in person from several RAF and Luftwaffe pilots <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> for this milestone occasion.|$|R
60|$|The cloth being drawn, {{and some}} sherry put upon the table (of which I had a glass), my aunt sent up for Mr. Dick again, <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> and looked as wise {{as he could}} when she {{requested}} him to attend to my story, which she elicited from me, gradually, by a course of questions. During my recital, {{she kept her eyes}} on Mr. Dick, who I thought would have gone to sleep but for that, and who, whensoever he lapsed into a smile, was checked by a frown from my aunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or perhaps Steinar finds Athalbrand's hall a {{pleasant}} place to bide in," [...] suggested Ragnar, <b>who</b> had <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> a spear in his hand, {{for he had}} come in from hunting. [...] "There are good drink and bright eyes there." ...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{this special}} issue was derived a year ago. The year 2014 was a {{significant}} anniversary both generally and personally. Personally, it was 80 years since the oldest of us, Douglas Henderson, was born. More generally, it was a hundred years since another important paper {{in the theory of}} liquids by Ornstein and Zernike appeared. With this in mind, we felt it is timely for a collection of expert contributions to fill {{at least some of the}} gaps on the way to answer that magic question What is "liquid"? We are thankful for all colleagues <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in this project...|$|R
50|$|Today, THS {{is one of}} {{the schools}} of the Institute {{providing}} courses to a varied range of students <b>who</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> with different objectives. Many youngsters attend pre-vocational courses {{to learn more about the}} industry before making their own academic and career choices; others, join professional programmes to obtain essential knowledge before start looking for their first job or before setting up their own business; industry staff take assessments to have their skills certified and recognized internationally; some aggressive workers come to acquire more skills and high-level knowledge to further develop their career; some people simply join our courses to learn something different.|$|R

60|$|Mr Green <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> Thereafter {{we came to}} the {{residence}} of a Mr Priest, <b>who</b> also <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> with his son, and thus we sped on over the flat sandy plains, inhaling the sweet scent of mimosa blossom, glowing in the fervid sunshine, and picking up comrades here and there, until about noon we reached the scene of our intended operations.|$|R

6000|$|Among the new {{passengers}} <b>who</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> at Lyons was {{a gentleman}} whose face was English, and whose dress was the dress of a clergyman. For {{the first time in}} my life, I hailed the appearance of a priest with a feeling of relief. The reason was this. From the moment when I had read Mrs. Finch's letter until now, a horrid doubt, which a priest was just the man to solve, had laid its leaden weight on my mind--and, I firmly believe, on Oscar's mind as well. Had time enough passed, since Lucilla had left Ramsgate, to allow of Nugent's marrying her, under his brother's name? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are prisoners, {{though we}} have not surrendered," [...] Wulf replied. [...] "We were saved by our good friend Lord de Burg, <b>who</b> has <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in our search for you.

60|$|Then I gave {{up looking}} and thinking, since {{now or never}} was the time for action. Signalling and {{shouting}} to those hatchet-faced Amahagger to advance, accompanied by Umslopogaas with Goroko <b>who</b> had <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> and Hans, I sprang forward {{to give them an}} example, which, to be just to them, they took.|$|R
