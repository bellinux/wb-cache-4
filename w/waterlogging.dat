It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to <b>waterlogging.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lympne {{returned}} to civilian use on 1 January 1946. In 1948, the first air ferry service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways. Problems with <b>waterlogging</b> {{of the grass}} runway and the refusal of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd (Ferryfield) in 1954. By 1956, the airport's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd, the Skyways holding company. Skyways operated a coach-air service between London and Paris, flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais. This service operated until 1974 (1955–1958: the original Skyways; 1958–1971: Skyways Coach-Air; 1971–1972: Skyways International; 1972–1974: Dan-Air Skyways). Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974, Lympne continued {{to be used as}} a General Aviation airfield until about 1984. The site is now an industrial estate.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was {{waterlogged}} {{and services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September <b>waterlogging</b> again stopped the air ferry, which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned for improvements to the runway and was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E

5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from <b>waterlogging</b> and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E

These floods occur when typhoon-induced storm surges coincide with high spring tides and meet with high discharges from the river network {{as a result of}} the typhoon downpours. Third, typhoon-induced torrential rain has caused <b>waterlog</b> hazards, particularly in the most densely populated parts of Shanghai. The <b>waterlog</b> hazard has been exacerbated by land subsidence and poor management of pumping systems.

40|$|Abstract. Agricultural {{production}} and water conservancy facilities in china are {{a high probability}} of suffering from disasters of flood and waterloging,it is important for researching {{on the impact of}} it. Based on actual data from 1990 to 2010, disasters of flood and <b>waterloging</b> impact on agricultural {{production and}} water conservancy facilities is analysed. The rate of areas covered is the highest rate in 1991,reaching 16. 4 percent, the average rate 8. 96 percent; The rate of areas affected is the highest rate in 2003,reaching 63. 8 percent, the average rate 54. 4 percent; The rate of areas affected completely in Hainan is the highest rate in 2010 in china,reaching 57. 4 percent, usually about from 20 percent to 40 percent. The average number of large and medium damaged reservoirs caused by disasters of flood and <b>waterloging</b> is 43. 8 from 2006 to 2010, small damaged reservoirs 17. 87 hundred, the damaged embankments 48. 239 thousand, the damaged embankments length 10. 42 thousand km, the damaged locks 9. 97 thousand, the direct economic losses of water conservancy facilities 27. 95 billion RMB. But the indicators in 2010 is higher than average value,indicating water conservancy facilities damaged severely. The flood and <b>waterloging</b> has a significant impact on growth and yield of crops. The rate of areas covered, the rate of areas affected, the rate of areas affected completely are three important indicators to evaluate the damaged area of crop. Impact on water conservancy facilities is very serious,the central and local governments need to pay high attention to it...|$|R

40|$|<b>Waterloging</b> and {{salinity}} in {{many places}} in the world are affected by natural conditions, geological history, irrigation practice and replacement of natural vegetations.

Provisions of vegetations tolerate to this typical salty condition, although take a longer time to solve, are much cheaper and effective means to control salinity and even to rehabilitate the lands. E. occidentalis, a highly tolerant species to those conditions need to be tested as an alternative species for plantation under these conditions. Genetic materials from its natural distribution were tested to find out the most tolerant provenance under inundation and high salt level. Two controlled testings using 9 E. occidentalis provenances were conducted reaching to 300 mM salt and followed by an increased level up to sea salt concentration (550 mM NaCl). Provenances from the same genetic materials were also tested in 3 field trials, i. e. : in Roberts, Sandalwindy and Kirkwood with different ranges of salt level. At salt concentration of 300 mM, E. occidentalis growth was not affected, and therefore this level is too low for selection.
