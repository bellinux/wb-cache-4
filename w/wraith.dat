5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the <b>wraith</b> of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge {{the deaths of the}}ir loved ones. Players can engage in melee combat, and use <b>wraith</b> abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember the deaths of the game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Talion, {{a captain}} of Gondor, serves within a {{garrison}} {{stationed at the}} Black Gate of Mordor. The garrison is attacked by Sauron's Orc forces led by three Black Númenórean captains: the Hammer of Sauron (John DiMaggio), the Tower of Sauron (JB Blanc), and their leader, the Black Hand of Sauron (Nolan North). Talion, his wife Ioreth (Laura Bailey), and his adult son, Dirhael, are captured and ritually sacrificed by the Black Hand {{in an attempt to}} summon into himself the <b>wraith</b> of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor. However, Celebrimbor (who suffers from amnesia due to his centuries as a <b>wraith)</b> instead merges with Talion, preventing him from dying alongside his family. Talion and Celebrimbor then depart to both uncover Celebrimbor's identity—increasing his/their power—and avenge the death of Talion's family.|$|E
50|$|The Dire <b>Wraiths</b> are an {{evolutionary}} {{offshoot of the}} Skrulls from the Andromeda Galaxy. Like the Skrulls, the <b>Wraiths</b> are shape-shifters, {{able to take the}} forms of other creatures. The <b>Wraiths</b> were originally depicted as amorphous, cloudy, vaguely humanoid-shaped beings. However, it was eventually revealed that was a transitional form used for shape-shifting and that their true form is entirely different. The Dire <b>Wraiths</b> are Skrullian Deviants engineered by the starfaring Celestials. The <b>Wraiths</b> have both reptilian and mammalian like traits. The females lay eggs and lactate.|$|R
5000|$|Pah <b>Wraiths</b> (also spelled Pagh <b>Wraiths,</b> Bajoran for Soul <b>Wraiths)</b> are {{the enemies}} of the Bajoran Prophets. Bajoran {{religious}} texts state that the Pah-wraiths once resided in the Celestial Temple (the Bajoran Wormhole) alongside the Prophets and, like them, are similar non-corporeal beings. However, they were expelled from the Celestial Temple and banished to the Fire Caves on Bajor. According to ancient Bajoran texts, the Pah <b>Wraiths</b> were [...] "false Prophets". Whereas the Prophets are analogous to angels or even gods, the Pah <b>Wraiths</b> are analogous to demons.|$|R
50|$|The Dire <b>Wraiths</b> have super-strength {{and have}} the ability to shape-shift. Some <b>Wraiths</b> (mostly female) also {{practice}} sorcery.|$|R
5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the <b>Wraith,</b> aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the <b>Wraith</b> enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the <b>Wraith</b> and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John <b>Wraith,</b> Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E
5000|$|The Dire <b>Wraiths</b> seek {{to conquer}} all they see. Over 200 years ago, the Dire <b>Wraiths</b> invaded the planet of Elonia. However, this would {{ultimately}} spell doom for the <b>Wraiths,</b> {{as one of}} the Elonians, Rom became a Space Knight of the Solstar Order to combat them. The Solstar Order prevailed, causing the <b>Wraiths</b> to scatter throughout the galaxy, with Rom earning a name among his enemies: [...] "Wraithslayer". The Dire <b>Wraiths</b> secretly invaded the Earth sometime during the 1800s and spent the next two centuries infiltrating the world's governments and militaries, preparing for their eventual encounter with Rom.|$|R

50|$|Hawkmoon and Oladahn are imprisoned {{awaiting}} an ornithopter {{to transport}} them to Sicilia. Oladahn reveals {{that he was}} rescued from his fall by ghosts, and these <b>wraiths</b> re-appear and free the pair. The <b>wraiths</b> are the inhabitants of Soryandum, transformed by their own science so that they exist in another dimension. D'Averc is planning to raze Soryandum which would destroy the <b>wraiths,</b> so they call on Hawkmoon to aid them by recovering a pair of old Soryandum machines. When they transcended this dimension the <b>wraiths</b> had the machines hidden and guarded by a mechanical beast which Hawkmoon will have to defeat.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the <b>Wraith</b> Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the <b>Wraith,</b> meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the <b>Wraith,</b> but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
50|$|However, Jones {{eventually}} {{decided to}} hide {{himself and his}} family from the people seeking the armor, and went to live in the town of Clairton, West Virginia, where he encountered Rom the Spaceknight and learned about the <b>Wraiths.</b> Jones agreed to help Rom protect the town from the <b>Wraiths,</b> and Rom altered the costume so its lenses would allow the user to see a Dire <b>Wraith's</b> true form.|$|R

25|$|In the 2007 made-for-TV {{movie on}} the SciFi Channel, <b>Wraiths</b> of Roanoke, Virginia Dare {{is the sole}} {{survivor}} after the colony is wiped out by Old Norse ghosts, or <b>wraiths,</b> who had died on the island centuries earlier but failed to achieve transit to Valhalla. In the movie the infant Virginia, whose innocence is needed by the <b>wraiths,</b> is used by her father to lure the <b>wraiths</b> onto a flaming raft set adrift for a Viking funeral. The last act of Ananias is to cast Virginia away from the raft in a wicker basket. She is found and adopted by the mainland Indians the next day.|$|R

50|$|Soon afterwards, the <b>Wraiths</b> {{launched}} {{a plan to}} help them conquer Earth once and for all; they cast a spell on Earth's sun, allowing them to use its energies to draw Wraithworld into Earth's solar system. This greatly increased their magical powers. Emboldened, the <b>Wraiths</b> made a mass attack on New York City, where they clashed with dozens of the city's superheroes. However, thanks to Rom, who used a special satellite to boost {{the power of his}} Neutralizer, Wraithworld in its entirety was banished into Limbo, causing all <b>Wraiths</b> in this galaxy to lose their powers, including, apparently, their shape-shifting abilities. Subsequently, Rom banishes all the defeated <b>Wraiths</b> into Limbo.|$|R

50|$|Around this time, several <b>Wraiths</b> attack Storm of the X-Men and Forge. Though {{without her}} mutant powers, Storm manages {{to hold her}} own as the Dire <b>Wraiths</b> invade Forge's building. They are {{eventually}} defeated. Meanwhile, the various Earth governments throw their support to defeating the Dire <b>Wraiths</b> with Rom employed as both {{an expert on the}} species and commander of field operations hunting down the menace. Since SHIELD's psychic personnel are essential in this effort, the Dire <b>Wraiths</b> cast deadly magic that target those personnel in particular to make their participation in the field effectively suicide. However, the psychics were determined to continue their part and Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange intervened on his own accord to cast a spell on them to improve their resistance to the attacks.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of killing}} his foes, Rom the Spaceknight banished Dire <b>Wraiths</b> to a zone called Limbo.
