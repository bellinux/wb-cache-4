5|$|Director Quentin Tarantino {{expressed}} interest in directing an adaptation of Casino Royale, but Eon were not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with Casino Royale. Tarantino also {{said he would have}} set it in the 1960s and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E

Incidentally, this also caused him to fall short of the 3,000 hits, 300 homers and 300 stolen bases mark; he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>only</b> the second player in history to reach that club, the other being Willie Mays.|$|R

500|$|Modern {{estimates}} of the odds of an Athenian woman becoming an epikleros say that roughly one out of seven fathers died without biological sons. However, Athenian law allowed {{for a man to}} adopt another male as a son in his will, so not all daughters without brothers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become epikleroi. Most modern historians estimate that 20% of families <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> daughters, and another 20% <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been childless. The modern historian Cynthia Patterson said of the epikleros that although [...] "she was distinctive, she was not rare".|$|R
5|$|The player {{initially}} {{can see a}} top-down view of the surface-level of {{the fortress}} site; each layer of a z-axis level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level {{would be seen as}} its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it dug into a room.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{evacuation}} plan agreed with the DAO, Air America committed 24 of its 28 available helicopters to support {{the evacuation}} and 31 pilots agreed to stay in Saigon to support the evacuation; this meant that most helicopters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> one pilot rather than the usual two. At 08:30 on 29 April, with the shelling of Tan Son Nhut Airport subsiding, Air America began ferrying its helicopter and fixed-wing pilots from their homes in Saigon to the Air America compound at Tan Son Nhut, {{across the road from}} the DAO Compound. Air America helicopters started flying to the rooftop LZs in Saigon and either shuttled the evacuees back to the DAO Compound or flew out to the ships of TF76. By 10:30 all of Air America's fixed-wing aircraft had departed Tan Son Nhut, evacuating all non-essential personnel and as many Vietnamese evacuees as they could carry and headed for Thailand. At some point during the morning VNAF personnel took 5 ICCS UH1-H Hueys and one Air America Bell 204 from the Air America ramp.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{union with}} the United States was not a {{referendum}} option, despite the idea having some currency amongst locals. With the Cold War looming, U.S. interest in Newfoundland were centered primarily on its strategic importance to the defence of North America. The Americans' ability to maintain bases on the island satisfied those concerns - after receiving assurances that the Canadian government would honour the leases for bases on Newfoundland, the U.S. State department had no further interest in the political future of Newfoundland. President Harry S. Truman's administration had little incentive to pursue annexation. With respect to foreign policy, such a territorial ambition <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> served to antagonize two key allies. With respect to domestic policy, the administration would not likely {{have been able to}} convince Congress to offer statehood to Newfoundland due to its small population and geographical isolation from the then-48 existing states, and would not likely have been able to convince Newfoundlanders to accept territorial status as an alternative to admission as a U.S. state.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E

5000|$|Jones {{notes that}} the term [...] "surroundings" [...] is a {{specific}} term referring to the rural areas around the village of Bethlehem.

Albright and Mann estimate the village <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> some 300 people at the time, Raymond E. Brown estimates it was around a thousand. For all these figures, {{the number of children}} killed <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been less than twenty. This number clashes with the traditional view of thousands of deaths, but it helps explain why the massacre was not mentioned by any historians such as Josephus. The killing of all the infants in a small village <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>only</b> one of many massacres Herod is recorded to have carried out in his later years.
