5|$|Militant {{action was}} not a {{hallmark}} of the movements in Wales and Welsh members, who more often identified themselves as suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means.

5|$|The Representation of the People Act {{was passed}} in 1918 which gave <b>women</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> age of 30, who met a {{property}} qualification, the right to vote. Several factors led to {{the passing of the}} Act, including the efforts of working women, the dilution of anti-suffrage rhetoric and political change in London, where Asquith had been replaced as Prime Minister by Lloyd George. The government believed that six million voters would be added by the 1918 Act, in Wales the electorate rose from 430,000 to 1,172,000.|$|E

5|$|Nine new {{events were}} held, {{including}} {{two from the}} new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3000 metre steeplechase for the first time. Marathon open water swimming events for men and <b>women,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> distance of 10 kilometres, {{were added to the}} swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events. In fencing, women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team épée. Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian is the only sport in which men and women compete together in the same events. Baseball and softball may have made their last appearances in Olympics history during these Games, as the International Olympic Committee voted to remove them from the programme of the 2012 Olympics. A total of 958 medals for events (302 gold, 303 silver and 353 bronze) were awarded. In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each weight class. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. Additionally there were ties for a silver medal and two bronze medals.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that HCC most {{commonly}} occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis) and cirrhosis (about 80%), screening by ultrasound (US) is commonly advocated in this population. Surveillance recommendations vary, but the American Association of Liver Diseases recommends screening Asian men over the age of 40, Asian <b>women</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> age of 50, people with HBV and cirrhosis, and African and North American blacks. These people are screened with ultrasound every 6 months. Additional evaluation may include measurement of blood levels of AFP, which is a tumor marker. Elevated levels of AFP are associated with active HCC disease. At levels >20 sensitivity is 41-65% and specificity is 80-94%. However, at levels >200 sensitivity is 31, specificity is 99%.|$|E
