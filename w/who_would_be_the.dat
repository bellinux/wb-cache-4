5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Development of MediEvil {{begun in}} late 1995 at {{independent}} developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, {{he said he wanted to}} work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E
5|$|Six weeks later, Bolt again {{turned down}} his R {{and joined the}} 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying the F-86 Sabre. Ruddell {{assigned}} him to First Lieutenant Joseph C. McConnell, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> top ace in the war. Bolt and McConnell quickly established a close friendship in spite of Bolt's superior rank, and he attributed his success in Korea to McConnell's guidance. Ruddell sent a request to Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus, commander of the Fifth United States Air Force, that Bolt's tour with the squadron be extended. The request was granted, and McConnell and Bolt began going on combat missions together as wingmen in MiG Alley, the area in northwestern Korea where air-to-air combat was most frequent. Bolt's Sabre, tail number 52-2582, was named Darling Dottie.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} one of 20 to receive an {{invitation}} to the Tour de France. Contador, Leipheimer, and Armstrong were all named to the team. There was much speculation and controversy, which began when Armstrong first signed with the team, over <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> team's protected rider in the Tour. Though Armstrong's express goal in returning from retirement was to win an eighth Tour de France, Contador had won his last three Grand Tours and insisted that he deserved leadership of the team and hinted that he might leave if forced to support Armstrong. Bruyneel assured Contador that he would be the leader before the season began. Contador was also publicly named team leader shortly before the Tour began.|$|E
5|$|As the war began, William Stacy {{served as}} major in Colonel Benjamin Woodbridge's {{regiment}} of Minutemen, which was organized into Woodbridge's (25th) Regiment. During the Siege of Boston, Woodbridge's regiment was based at Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston, {{and participated in}} the Battle of Bunker Hill, the first large-scale battle of the war. An orderly book shows that on June 13, 1775, several days before the battle, Major Stacy was officer of the night guard, while Colonel William Prescott, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> primary leader of patriot forces during the battle, was officer of the day. Stacy was recommended for commission on June 16, {{the day before the}} battle. On June 17, 1775, Woodbridge's regiment of 300 soldiers arrived at Bunker Hill and took up positions immediately prior to the battle, and parts of the regiment engaged. A portion of Woodbridge's regiment joined Colonel Prescott's regiment at the redoubt and breastwork on the hill, and a company from Woodbridge's regiment deployed on the right flank.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reader}} {{participation}} game running in Dengeki G's Magazine, voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, which were to determine <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{subjects in the}} couplings between the characters of each respective school. The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with {{the highest number of}} votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes. The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest number of votes this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes. In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the number of votes increased dramatically; the number one voted couple {{for the third time in}} a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} sejm of 1632 eventually {{concluded in}} the election of Władysław; he had no serious other contenders. The decision on <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth's next king was reached on 8 November, but as the pacta conventa were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the pacta conventa, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; {{to find a way}} to fund a naval fleet; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the Sejm's approval; not to take a wife without the Senate's approval; to convince his brothers to take an oath to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the Royal Mint to the Royal Treasury rather than to a private treasury. When the election result had been announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the nobility (szlachta), who had taken part {{in the election}}, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first to break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped {{off the top of the}} upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} faced {{uncertainty}} relating to <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> starting quarterback. While {{it was expected}} that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job, the build-up to the season led to a quarterback controversy that turned into a three way battle between Forcier, Denard Robinson, and highly touted recruit Devin Gardner. On defense, Michigan installed a new 3–3–5 formation that the coaches hoped would better suit the players currently on the team. Michigan lost several key players from the previous season, including DE Brandon Graham, the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player, RB's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown, LB Stevie Brown, and CB Donovan Warren. Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice, as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began.|$|E
