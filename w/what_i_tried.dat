500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "Slaughter", Ndegéocello tried to weave {{together}} sonic influences from the producers Trevor Horn and RZA, {{as well as}} the bands Yes, Sade, and The Human League: [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to achieve in this particular recording: some sonic tapestries that people, even if they're not listening to the lyrics, could just feel or hear, or just have a deep, inner dialogue with." [...] She covered Ready for the World's 1986 song [...] "Love You Down", deconstructing it into what Village Voice critic Eugene Holley Jr. described as [...] "a stripper's classic". Songs such as [...] "Mass Transit" [...] and [...] "White Girl" [...] featured Ndegéocello's characteristic ska and reggae influenced basslines; Holley argued that Caribbean riddims and country-rock guitar grooves underpinned the music, serving as a backdrop for Ndegéocello's contralto singing throughout Devil's Halo. In the opinion of Ed Potton from The Times, her voice [...] "resided somewhere between Sade and PJ Harvey".|$|E
500|$|Carey and her {{management}} {{then decided}} to release [...] "It's Like That" [...] as the album's lead single, calling it [...] "the right fire-starter". The singer has praised Dupri for being [...] "focused", and felt that together they had composed some of her favorite songs on the album. She has told MTV, [...] "The album is not about making the older executives happy by making a bring-down-the-house, tearjerker ballad, or [...] steeped in the media dramas of my life. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to do was keep the sessions very sparse, underproduced, like in '70s soul music ... According to Reid, Carey intended for the album to feature a more unpolished sound than her previous releases. The singer had been frustrated with the overproduction on many of her previous records, due to the inclusion of what she considered unnecessary [...] "bells and whistles". She opted to record the majority of The Emancipation of Mimi live, alongside the band. Reid agreed with this decision and felt that the live vocals made the album sound more authentic.|$|E

Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New York Times magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. [...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what I decided to do with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model." ...|$|E

[...] "Moving forward, their mission will be different," [...] he said. He also stated: [...] "For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues.

6000|$|I {{thought that}} before {{dressing}} I would accumulate my clothes. I pawed {{around in the}} dark and found everything packed together on the floor except one sock.

6000|$|He feared me--I {{could hardly}} expect otherwise, while a deer has memory--but he lay {{perfectly}} still, his head extended on the snow, his sides heaving.
