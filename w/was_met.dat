40|$|In earlier work, we {{described}} an equivalence result for network capacity. Roughly, that result is as follows. Given {{a network of}} noisy, memoryless, point-to-point channels, replace each channel by a noiseless, memoryless bit pipe of the same capacity yields a new network such that any collection of demands can <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the network of noisy links {{if and only if}} the same demands can <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the network of noiseless links. We here expand on these ideas to provide a framework for studying more general networks, including networks containing memoryless broadcast, multiple access, and interference channels. For each network in this broader class, we design two corresponding networks of noiseless, memoryless point-to-point links. These two networks provide upper and lower bounds in the following sense. Fix an arbitrary collection of demands. If the given demands can <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the lower bounding network, then they can also <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the original network. Likewise, if the given demands can <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the original network, then they can also <b>be</b> <b>met</b> on the upper bounding network. California Institute of Technology.
