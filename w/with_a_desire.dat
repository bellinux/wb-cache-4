5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the earlier {{priority}} of good sea {{air on the}} pier had been replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> for public entertainment. The pier reached record levels of attendance in the early 20th century, attracting around 1.5 million visitors between 1910 and 1911. Attendance fell due to the onset of World War I, but resumed afterwards, with around 2 million people visiting between 1918 and 1919.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to kill him, altered {{the course of the}} history of music.|$|E

5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire,</b> intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E

25|$|Új Előre (New Forward) (1921–1937) — Új Előre was a Communist Party-sponsored {{publication}} {{from the}} outset and it gave great attention to the ongoing situation in Hungary {{in the aftermath of}} the failed 1919 Hungarian Revolution. The publication was nominally edited by an American citizen, but the key editorial work was done by an editorial board dominated by emigrants from Soviet Hungary, including Lajos Köves, János Lassen, and Lajos Bebrits. In 1931 the publication was moved from New York City to Cleveland, a decision which was reversed in 1937. Economic problems combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to remake the publication as a less partisan Popular Front newspaper led to its discontinuation in 1937 in favor of the weekly Amerikai Magyar Világ.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the {{two major}} ballet {{companies}} in Canada were the Royal Winnipeg Ballet headed by Gweneth Lloyd and the Volkoff Canadian Ballet founded by Boris Volkoff and based in Toronto. Although both of these companies were well renowned, they were biased in their selection of dancers and often held auditions in their founding cities. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to create an unbiased Canadian ballet troupe, and inspired by the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, a group of ballet enthusiasts set out to create the National Ballet of Canada. Both Lloyd and Volkoff were interested in being the first {{artistic director of the}} company, but the organisers agreed {{that the only way to}} create a truly unbiased ballet company was to hire an outsider named Celia Franca as artistic director.|$|E
