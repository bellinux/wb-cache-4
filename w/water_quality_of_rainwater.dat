40|$|Coal dust {{contains}} {{trace elements}} of major/minor concern {{due to their}} potential impact on human health. Residential households in relatively close proximity to a coal dust source, such as a coal terminal, report that coal dust soils laundry and impacts upon visibility in the atmosphere. One question often asked is - does coal dust {{pose a threat to}} human health after being deposited on a rooftop and being washed into the rainwater tank? The answer lies in the likelihood and amount of coal dust (and trace elements) reaching the roof and being transferred to the tank; the potential for leaching of trace elements within the water column in the rainwater tank; and the <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainwater</b> at the point of use (kitchen tap). A range of coal types were supplied by the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal (DBCT) which reflected the likely composition of existing coal dust in the area. Leaching experiments were undertaken on a range of coal types (of particle size < 63 μm) {{to determine the extent of}} elemental leaching from the coal dust to the rainwater. In addition, water samples from three households (tanks and taps) in the Dalrymple Bay area were obtained and tested for elements considered both a major and minor concern in coal. Leaching experiments suggest that major/minor trace elements in the coal dust are not likely to be a main contributor to trace elements found in rainwater; and in fact may assist in removing some trace elements from the rainwater in the tank. Water samples from all three households recorded concentrations far lower than Australian Drinking Water Guidelines for all tested elements...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable Urban Water Management (SUWM), a new {{approach}} to manage stormwater as a water resource instead of nuisance, has the potential to supplement the diminishing traditional water supplies as well as reducing surface water pollution from storm runoff. Uncertainties of public health risks represent one of the main barriers for the smooth transition to SUWM approach as urban stormwater is known to be highly variable in water quality and is less studied than the conventional water supplies. My research is aimed at improving our state-of-knowledge for the public health risks associated with the SUWM practices. Using the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) framework as my main research tool, I investigated the risk implications of three SUWM scenarios: 1) rainwater harvesting, 2) stormwater harvesting, and 3) discharging stormwater into recreational water. As household-level rainwater harvesting is the most readily implementable SUWM approach, I first investigated the public health risks associated with using the rooftop harvested rainwater for household produce irrigation—a reasonable scenario considering the relatively clean <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainwater.</b> My result showed that the risk associated with consuming produce irrigated by harvested rainwater exceeded the EPA’s benchmark for safe drinking water, but is still at least ten-fold lower than when reclaimed water is used for the same purpose. To investigate the risks associated with capturing, treating, and reusing urban stormwater collected from urban developments, I examined three non-potable household applications: 1) toilet-flushing, 2) showering, and 3) foodcrop irrigation. My results showed that harvested stormwater is only safe for toilet-flushing under the circumstances considered. However, interpretations of the risks also differ depending on the risk benchmark used for comparison. In my final case study, I adopted a new contamination source apportionment QMRA method to investigate the recreational health risks associated with discharging stormwater into a popular recreational beach. My results showed that sewage contamination of urban stormwater is the governing factor for elevated risks in the water. However, the risk levels are within the acceptable risk set by the U. S. EPA in most of the cases in spite of the violation of water quality standard due to contribution of fecal bacteria from non-human sources. The overall finding of my research demonstrated that the QMRA is a powerful tool to provide a scientific basis for SUWM decisions. The risk outcomes can be used to set the appropriate public health risk management guidelines and water legislation that are necessary for the progress of SUWM practices...|$|E

A number of water supply projects, some with foreign funding, have included rainwater harvesting as a technical option in their planning. The technology has been disseminated by Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum and has been successfully taken on by the government sector as well as the non-government sector throughout the country. The attraction <b>of</b> the <b>rainwater</b> harvesting system is the low cost, simple design and construction technology, its independence from a central system, accessible and easily maintained at household.

40|$|Introduction: The {{research}} {{was performed in}} two rural sites in Thailand and Laos. The Diarrhea and Dengue (DIADEN) group from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences facilitated the fieldwork. In the Thai site, rainwater was the main drinking water source, whereas in Lao site, unprotected dug well was predominant in dry season {{and was replaced by}} rainwater in wet season. Drinking water was largely consumed untreated. Combined with varying sanitation service and hygiene behavior, it was assumed that the safety of drinking water might be compromised. Problem definition: The global monitoring of the MDG target to halve the population without safe drinking water access is performed by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). The JMP uses technological classification (improved or unimproved sources) as monitoring indicator for water safety. This has been criticized for being inadequate in representing the actual conditions in water provision. The core argument is that drinking <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> at improved sources might not necessarily be free from pathogens. In addition, drinking water that is safe at the sources might as well be recontaminated through various water handling practices, particularly where manual collection, transport and storage are common. Thus, in this study it is proposed that the technological classification is refined {{through the use of a}} semi-quantitative hazard classification system. Research: In the first part, the {{research was}} focused on the identification and classification of the hazards found at the various water sources and the hazards related to sanitation facility and hygiene behavior. This was achieved through sanitary inspection, household questionnaire and spot observation carried out in about two weeks time. In the second part, water samples were collected twice at selected sources and household drinking containers. Samples were tested for E. coli as faecal indicator organisms, using the standard Colisure/Ouanti-tray 2000 method from IDEXX. The <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> data were then used to validate the hazard classification systems. Simultaneously, a new E. coli enumeration method, the Compartment Bag Test (CBT) by University of North Carolina, was used in parallel to investigate the comparability of the two tests. Results: 1. The first investigation found that the hazards in Laos were more severe than in Thailand. 2. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rainwater</b> source (improved) was variably contaminated. The unprotected dug well (unimproved) was grossly contaminated. 3. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> at the household containers was also variable. Overall, there was significant deterioration <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> from sources to households that can be attributed to household water handling practices (e. g. extraction methods, cleanliness, treatment). 4. The hazard classification system for water sources in Laos was moderately correlated with <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> data and was not significantly correlated for Thailand. The sanitation and hygiene hazards were not significantly correlated in both sites. 5. The CBT data was significantly different from the Colisure/Quanti-tray 2000 data. Conclusions and recommendations: The JMP indicator overestimates water safety both at sources and at households. The hazard classification system, if refined further with weighted-scoring and long-term <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> data, might enable a more accurate representation of the actual conditions. Correlations with health impacts are also recommended. Furthermore, manual water handling practices compromises <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and it is thus advised to eliminate hand-water contact as much as possible.
