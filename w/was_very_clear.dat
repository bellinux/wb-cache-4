5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

He is granted {{the ability to}} summon demons from Nicaea after {{experiencing}} a train accident {{on his way home}} from taking mock exams. With this newfound power he finds himself intertwined in a battle of survival against the Septentriones who seek to destroy the world. Kamiya did not express any opinions on Hibiki's character. However he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to point out that despite the series being called Devil Survivor 2, it is not a sequel to a previous series but rather an independent story all its own.|$|E

That <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

25|$|The {{thematic}} {{material of}} Symphony No. 2 {{is designed to}} emulate the sensation of flying. Barber <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{that he did not}} view the symphony as program music. However, in his program notes he mentions that the first movement was meant to capture the excitement of flying while the second movement was inspired by his night flights. The final movement begins with very fast string passages with no barlines to express the sensation of flight. Samuel Barber uses tension and release throughout to create a greater sense of energy. His use of ostinatos, polytonality, dissonance, and angular lines create a work that can be described as one of Barber's most progressive works. Barber would later revise the work and state that the symphony has no programmatic intentions.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, glass mirrors {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Bánáthy {{recruited}} two patrols of boys to take part. [...] Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. At the beginning {{there was not much}} discussion of leadership competencies. Chiorini said, [...] "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Kalabhavan Shajon, who {{previously}} {{worked in the}} industry as a comedian and the sidekick of the lead actors, was chosen for the main antagonistic role. The director stated, [...] "I had two-three actors in mind, but at last decided to pick Shajon. I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that I did not want anyone who has played negative characters so far to do the role. Shajon was a total revelation." [...] Roshan Basheer, who debuted through Plus Two (2010), was chosen after conducting a screen test. Prithviraj was rumored to play a cameo role, though this was denied by Jeethu. Asha Sarath was later signed {{for the role of}} a police officer. Child actors Ansiba Hassan and Esther Anil, along with Siddique, Irshad, Kunchan and Koottickal Jayachandran were also cast to play major supporting roles.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Meyers {{writes that}} Hemingway <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> about the husband's role, {{because in this}} story he was writing about a {{familiar}} subject—the experiences of his boyhood in Michigan. The young father's role is to [...] "deflate the doctor", who finds victory in slicing open the woman's belly to deliver the infant, {{and to provide a}} counterpoint to the mother's strength and resilience. The father's suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of the white doctor whose skill is necessary, but who brings with him destruction. In her paper [...] "Screaming Through Silence: The Violence of Race in 'Indian Camp'", Amy Strong writes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] is about domination; the husband kills himself at the moment his wife is cut open by a white doctor. She thinks the theme of domination exists on more than one level: Nick is dominated by his father; the white outsiders dominate in the Indian camp; and the white doctor [...] "has cut into the woman, like the early settlers leaving a gash in the tree." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{hopes of}} averting the lean years that troubled most {{expansion}} teams, George Imlach, the Sabres first coach and General Manager, attempted {{to build a}} high-scoring club to excite the local hockey fans. Perreault {{was regarded as a}} smooth skater and tremendous stickhandler. [...] Perreault was chosen to be the franchise player around which a team could be built and succeed. [...] Although Martin and Perreault had played two years together with the Montreal Junior Canadiens (Perreault even lived with Martin's family during the 1969–70 season), they had never played on the same line before being paired in Buffalo. [...] Since Martin {{was one of the few}} who could keep up with Perreault as a skater they were paired together after the Sabres drafted Martin. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> during the 1971–72 season that Perreault and Martin were a natural pairing. [...] Sabres coach Joe Crozier felt the two just needed a third player who would stay high and check. [...] Sabres coach quickly teamed Robert with Perreault and Martin after the trade. [...] The two players complemented Perreault and became a dynamic combination that dazzled fans. [...] They were dubbed the French Connection by writer Lee Coppola as a reference to the Academy Award-winning film and their heritage via the Buffalo Auditorium message board. [...] The pair played together as a regular line through the 1974–75 season. [...] At times, they were split up during the last four seasons. [...] When they played together they often faced the opposition's top defensive lineups. [...] Since the trio were tremendous skating scoring threats these opponents would concentrate on checking them and staying on top of them. [...] For example, against the Montreal Canadiens Bob Gainey's line would oppose them. [...] Rick Martin once said about this line [...] "I had Jimmy Roberts between me and my shadow." ...|$|E
