A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%â€”five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E

25|$|One {{significant}} contribution to the increase in teenage substance abuse is an increase in the availability of prescription medication.

2500|$|Donors are {{screened}} for health risks {{that could make}} the donation unsafe for the recipient. [...] Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) for HIV risk. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year.</b> A similar change was made in the U.S. in late 2015 by the FDA. [...] Autologous donors are not always {{screened for}} recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or a women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing) medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin, finasteride and dutasteride.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot is reacquainted with Miss Carnaby, the {{companion}} from the {{episode of the}} Nemean Lion, whom Poirot praises {{as one of the}} most successful criminals he has ever met. She is worried as she constantly thinks of illegal schemes which she is sure would work and she fears she is turning into a hardened criminal. She wants to put her talents to good use and assist Poirot in fighting crime in any way she can. She also has brought to him a possible case in which she can prove herself. She has a friend, Mrs Emmeline Clegg, a widow who is comfortably off. In her loneliness, Mrs Clegg has found comfort in a religious sect called [...] "The Flock of the Shepherd", based in a retreat in Devon. Their leader, Dr Andersen, is a handsome, charismatic man. Mrs Clegg has made a will leaving all of her property to the Flock. Miss Carnaby is especially concerned as she knows of three women in a similar situation who have all died <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year.</b> She has investigated and found nothing unusual in the deaths, all of which were due to natural causes and none of them happened within the sanctuary but at the deceased's homes. Poirot asks Miss Carnaby to infiltrate the sect. She is to pretend to be dismissive of them and then, once within the sanctuary, be persuaded to be a convert.|$|E

If he could only take her there, or into his own hills, where no man might follow them! It was a primeval longing, and, being a woman and the object of it, she saw its essential meaning in his face.

The vacant chair at John Inglefield's right hand was {{in memory of}} his wife, whom death had {{snatched}} from him since the previous Thanksgiving. With a feeling that few would have looked for in his rough nature, the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his own; and often did his eye glance thitherward, as if he deemed {{it possible that the}} cold grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful fireside, at least for that one evening. Thus did he cherish the grief that was dear to him. But there was another grief which he would fain have torn from his heart; or, since that could never be, have buried it too deep for others to behold, or for his own remembrance. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> another member of his household had gone from him, but not to the grave.

In this connection I renew my recommendation, made at the opening of the last session of Congress, that a special court be created to hear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States arising from acts committed against their persons or property during the insurrection. It appears equitable that opportunity should be offered to citizens of other states to present their claims, as well as to those British subjects whose claims were not admissible under the late commission, to the early decision of some competent tribunal. To this end I recommend the necessary legislation to organize a court to dispose of all claims of aliens of the nature referred to in an equitable and satisfactory manner, and to relieve Congress and the Departments from the consideration of these questions.|$|E
