25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was helpless and could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in times of emergency. A <b>Wireless</b> <b>transmitter-receiver</b> station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide ships and boats through the jagged rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E
30|$|Based {{on recent}} {{technological}} advances in wireless communication, low-power microelectronics integration and miniaturization, the manufacturing {{of a large}} number of low cost wireless sensors became technically and economically feasible. Wireless sensors are constrained devices with relatively small memory resource, restricted computation capability, short range <b>wireless</b> <b>transmitter-receiver</b> and limited built-in battery. Hundreds or thousands of these devices can potentially be networked as a wireless sensor network (WSN) for many applications that require unattended, long-term operations. Consequently, WSNs have emerged as a promising technology with various applications, such as activity recognition [1], intrusion detection [2], structural health monitoring [3], disaster management, etc.|$|E
40|$|Diversity {{methods have}} been shown {{recently}} to benefit wireless users that experience "dead spots". When a single <b>wireless</b> <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pair cannot establish a reliable link, receptions from multiple independent receivers can be combined {{in a variety of}} ways. However, the practical benefits of such methods depend on the availability of receiver diversity and have so far been limited to the upload direction that carries a small fraction of typical consumer traffic. In this paper we suggest that wireless users create their own receiver diversity by using external antennae, external wireless interfaces or employing their smartphone devices. Our measurements in the wild indicate that such diversity yields significant potential gains even if the ability to exploit it is limited by the current WLAN architecture. We propose a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluate it experimentally. 1...|$|E
30|$|In {{multimedia}} IoT devices, {{key factors}} of system power consumption include a microprocessor for information processing, memory devices for data storage, and <b>wireless</b> <b>transmitter-receivers</b> for data transmission. The {{amount of power}} consumed by the memory device {{is an important factor}} when transmitting and processing a high volume of data such as images. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to reduce power consumption by decreasing the size of image data with simple compression method before transmission to use computing processes and memory as small as possible [6 – 8]. Accordingly, low-memory compression methods have been adopted in mobile devices, especially in those that require high-power consumption and bandwidth for high-resolution display [9] and in vehicle safety systems that require very low delays for real-time image transmission [10].|$|R
40|$|International audienceConsider a <b>wireless</b> {{network of}} <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs. The {{transmitters}} adjust their powers {{to maintain a}} particular SINR target {{in the presence of}} interference from neighboring transmitters. In this paper we analyze the optimal power vector that may achieve this target in the presence of randomness in the network. In particular, we address the scenario where the receiver pairs may be located in one of two distinct distances from their serving transmitter base. We apply concepts from random matrix theory to evaluate the asymptotic mean optimal power per link. Our analytical results show substantial agreement with numerically generated networks, not only in one-dimensional network arrays but also in two dimensional network geometries. Notably, we observe that the optimal power in random networks does not go to infinity in a continuous fashion as in regular grids. Rather, beyond a certain point, no finite power solution exists...|$|R
40|$|The Channel {{allocation}} {{method is}} an Cooperative Asynchronous multichannel MAC which introduces an Distributed Information Sharing (DISH) {{to be used}} in a distributed flavor of control-plane cooperation, as a new approach to wireless protocol design and then apply it to multichannel medium access control(MAC) to solve the MCC problem. The basic idea is to allow nodes to share control information with each other such that nodes can make more informed decisions in communication. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a major role to create a wireless communication infrastructure. In <b>Wireless</b> network, <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs make independent decisions, which are often suboptimal due to insufficient knowledge about the communication environment. So, the new concept DISH is introduced and overcomes the problem occurred in the MAC protocol. The DISH concept avoids collision and re-transmission among nodes. The notion of control-plane cooperation augments the conventional understanding of cooperation, which sits at the data plane as a data relaying mechanism. In a multichannel network, DISH allows neighboring nodes to notify transmitter-receiver pairs of channel conflicts and deaf terminals to prevent collisions and retransmissions. Based on this, we design a single-radio cooperative asynchronous multichannel MAC protocol called CAM-MAC. When the CAM-MAC is used in illustration purposes, we choose a specific set of parameters for CAM-MAC. First we analyze the throughput to 91 % of the system bandwidth to 96 %, then saturate 15 channels and compare the result, this provides an good result in implementing hardware...|$|R
40|$|Consider a <b>wireless</b> {{network of}} <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs where the {{transmitters}} adjust their powers {{to maintain a}} target SINR level {{in the presence of}} interference. In this paper, we analyze the optimal power vector that achieves this target in large, random networks obtained by "erasing" a finite fraction of nodes from a regular lattice of transmitter-receiver pairs. We show that this problem is equivalent to the so-called Anderson model of electron motion in dirty metals which has been used extensively in the analysis of diffusion in random environments. A standard approximation to this model is the so-called coherent potential approximation (CPA) method which we apply to evaluate the first and second order intra-sample statistics of the optimal power vector in one- and two-dimensional systems. This approach is equivalent to traditional techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, but while generally accurate (and in agreement with numerical simulations), it fails to fully describe the system: in particular, results obtained in this way fail to predict when power control becomes infeasible. In this regard, we find that the infinite system is always unstable beyond a certain value of the target SINR, but any finite system only has a small probability of becoming unstable. This instability probability is proportional to the tails of the eigenvalue distribution of the system which are calculated to exponential accuracy using methodologies developed within the Anderson model and its ties with random walks in random media. Finally, using these techniques, we also calculate the tails of the system's power distribution under power control and the rate of convergence of the Foschini-Miljanic power control algorithm in the presence of random erasures. Overall, in the paper we try {{to strike a balance between}} intuitive arguments and formal proofs. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. Inform. Theor...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{wireless}} networks such as ad-hoc {{networks and}} sensor networks have attracted considerable {{attention in the}} last few years, both in academia and industry. One of the main reasons for their popularity {{can be attributed to the}} various applications that they make possible. Habitat monitoring, environmental observation and forecasting, organ and health monitoring and target tracking are just a few examples of the many applications of such wireless networks. A characteristic requirement of these wireless networks is that they be 2 ̆ 2 self-organizing 2 ̆ 2 i. e., the wireless nodes organize themselves in order to efficiently perform the tasks required by the application. Self-organizing networks are attractive since they do not require human intervention and thereby reduce the cost of installation. ^ In this thesis, we consider several tasks that arise commonly in the process of self-organization of a wireless ad hoc network, viz. topology formation, power control and leader election. We first consider the problem of neighbor discovery in wireless networks, the first step in bootstrapping a wireless network. We propose probabilistic algorithms that allow nodes to rapidly discover their neighbors, thereby expending less energy during neighbor discovery. In the second part of our thesis, we focus our attention on techniques to reduce the energy consumption of a wireless network. In particular, we consider the problem of optimal power assignment in <b>wireless</b> networks with <b>transmitter-receiver</b> tradeoffs. In these networks, the transmitter power can be increased to reduce the receiver power and consequently, the overall power consumption. We propose algorithms to assign power to nodes so that the lifetime of the network is maximized. Another aspect of self-configuration that arises frequently in wireless networks is the problem of leader election amongst a set of nodes. Arbitrary topological changes caused by node movement makes this problem significantly challenging. In the final part of this thesis, we propose a provably correct and highly efficient leader election algorithm that can tolerate arbitrary topological changes caused due to node movement. ...|$|R
