In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E

In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life.

5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> deter {{an outright}} {{attack by the}} Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused {{to participate in the}} campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting.

They calculated that the neck musculature <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were {{ruled by the}} Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was {{developed}} by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> abolish Nizamat (local rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.|$|E
5|$|On {{receiving}} this reply, Bonaparte immediately {{ordered his}} fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic {{sites around the}} island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta {{and all of its}} resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he {{and the rest of the}} expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} knez of Omiš, Nikola, was mentioned, {{along with his}} {{relatives}} and everyone under his lordship, in a peace treaty with Kotor from 1167. Knez Nikola's power and independence <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have Rogerije, the Archbishop of Split, executed in 1180. Family political influence at that time included Brač and Hvar, Breueco (Brenti, Brevko, Brečko)also of genus Kačićas well as the previous Šibenik iupanus (župan). Archbishop Rogerije, who also served Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as representative governor of Croatia, had become involved in a dispute about an estate around Mosor. A conte Nicola Aprico, who was identified in two dispute settlements of Split during 1178–79, {{is considered to be}} the same knez Nikola. In 1190, Nikola established a peace treaty with Dubrovnik. Like the 1167 treaty with Kotor, the 1190 treaty granted safe and free navigation to Dubrovnik ships from Molunat to Orebić (Trstenica).|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking {{as closely as possible}} to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E
5|$|On March21, a {{tropical}} disturbance quickly {{developed in the}} monsoon trough in the south-central Indian Ocean, about 1250km (775mi) east of Diego Garcia. A ridge to the south steered the system to the west-southwest, and moderate wind shear in the region prevented significant strengthening. The convection slowly organized, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ikala early on March25. By that time, the shear had decreased, although initially it <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prevent the convection from covering the center. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the southeast on March25, where upper-level conditions became more favorable for strengthening. Thunderstorms increased over the center, and an eye began developing on March26. The next day, Ikala intensified into {{a tropical}} cyclone, reaching peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to MFR; the JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Shortly after peaking, increased wind shear and drier air from the front quickly weakened Ikala, and it deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on March28. That day, the center became exposed from the convection, and on March29 Ikala became extratropical. The remnants turned to the southwest before recurving to the southeast on March31, and Ikala was absorbed by a cold front on April3.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{supported}} Dunstan and Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester, {{in their}} efforts to purify the Church from secularism. Aided by King Edgar, he took a prominent part in the revival of monastic discipline along the precepts of the Rule of Saint Benedict. His methods differed from Æthelwold's, who often violently ejected secular clergy from churches and replaced them with monks. Oswald also organised the estates of his see into administrative hundreds known as the Oswaldslow, which helped stabilise the ecclesiastical revenues. He constantly visited the monasteries he founded, and was long remembered as father of his people both as bishop and archbishop. It was Oswald who changed the cathedral chapter of Worcester from priests to monks, although the exact method that he employed is unclear. One tradition says that Oswald used a slow approach in building up a new church of monks next to the cathedral, allowing the cathedral's priests to continue performing services in the cathedral until the monastic foundation <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> take over the cathedral. Another tradition claims that, instead, Oswald expelled any of the clergy in the cathedral that would not give up their wives and replaced them with monks immediately. Oswald also reformed Winchcombe Abbey, along with the monasteries of Westbury Priory, Pershore Abbey, and Evesham Abbey. It is also possible that monasteries were established in Gloucester and Deerhurst, but evidence is lacking for their exact foundation dates.|$|E

5|$|She was {{converted}} into a guard ship on 28 June and stationed in Cattaro Bay, {{the same day that}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, the catalyst for the start of World War I a month later. She served in that role until June 1917. She returned to the cadet training school, and on 18 June left Cattaro for Pola. At 12:55 while cruising off the island of Lacroma, an accidental explosion tore a large hole in the bow, though the damage was above the waterline, allowing Zara to make port in Ragusa. The shipyard there effected temporary repairs to ensure her hull <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow her to continue on to Pola, which she reached on 26 June. In Pola, a commission determined that the cause of the explosion was a badly deteriorated warhead in one of her two torpedoes, though some later sources state she struck a naval mine. After her bow was permanently repaired, Zara served in the training school {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. With Austria-Hungary's defeat, the Allies seized most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet as war prizes, and Zara was allocated to Italy, which scrapped her by 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of regent (officially known as General-in-Chief 大將軍) was created during Emperor Wu's reign (r. 14187 BCE) when he appointed three officials {{to form a}} triumvirate regency over the central government while the child Emperor Zhao (r. 8774 BCE) sat on the throne. Regents were often relatives-in-law to the emperor through his empress's family, but they could also be men of lowly means who depended on the emperor's favor to advance their position at court. Eunuchs who maintained the harem of the palace could also gain a similar level of power. They often came from {{the middle class and}} had links to trade. In the Western Han, there are only a handful of examples where eunuchs rose to power since the official bureaucracy <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> suppress them. After the eunuch Shi Xian (石顯) became the Prefect of the Palace Masters of Writing (中尚書), Emperor Yuan (r. 4833 BCE) relinquished much of his authority to him, so that he was allowed to make vital policy decisions and was respected by officials. However, Shi Xian was expelled from office once Emperor Cheng (337 BCE) took the throne. No palace eunuch would obtain comparable authority again until after 92 CE, when the eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong (d. 107 CE) sided with Emperor He (r. 88105 CE) in a coup to overthrow the Dou 竇 clan of the empress dowager. Officials complained when eunuchs like Sun Cheng (d. 132 CE) were awarded by Emperor Shun (r. 125144 CE) with marquessates, yet after the year 135 CE the eunuchs were given legal authority to pass on fiefs to adopted sons. Although Emperor Ling (r. 168189 CE) relinquished a great deal of authority to eunuchs Zhao Zhong (d. 189 CE) and Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE), the eunuchs were slaughtered in 189 CE when Yuan Shao (d. 202 CE) besieged and stormed the palaces of Luoyang.|$|E
