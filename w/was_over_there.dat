5|$|The Florida Land Boom <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> <b>There</b> was no bridge {{built and}} no {{development}} on Key Biscayne {{for the next}} two decades. William Matheson died in 1930, leaving the island to his children. In 1939, the U.S. Navy approved a proposal to develop Virginia Key as an air base and sea port. There was talk of putting an air base on the north end of Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused {{problems}} for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when the war <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, {{it was thought that}} no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.|$|E

Those in the British West Indies, Newfoundland, the Province of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Bermuda, and East and West Florida remained {{loyal to the}} crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war <b>was</b> <b>over).</b> <b>There</b> was {{a certain degree of}} sympathy with the Patriot cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation. The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, {{especially in the case of}} Quebec and Florida.|$|E
25|$|Koxinga {{was born}} to Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese {{merchant}} and pirate, and Tagawa Matsu, a Japanese woman, in 1624 in Hirado, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. He was raised there until seven and moved to Quanzhou, in the Fujian province of China. In a family made wealthy from shipping and piracy, Koxinga inherited his father's trade networks, which stretched from Nagasaki to Macao. Following the Manchu advance on Fujian, Koxinga retreated from his stronghold in Amoy (Xiamen) and besieged Taiwan {{in the hope of}} establishing a strategic base to marshal his troops to retake his base at Amoy. In 1662, following a nine-month siege, Koxinga captured the Dutch fortress Zeelandia and Taiwan became his base (see Kingdom of Tungning). The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions, the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on May 17, 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks. Koxinga died four months after the siege <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> were speculations that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing had an affair with his wet nurse and conceived a child with her. Other accounts are more straightforward, attributing Koxinga's death to a case of malaria.|$|E

500|$|After the 2009–10 season <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> {{was much}} {{speculation}} over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active {{on the social}} media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me.

[...] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.|$|E
500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} {{technological advances}} of World War II displaced the Nonius {{as a military}} horse, {{and it was then}} directed towards agriculture instead. However, the depredations of the war severely damaged the breed, {{and by the time the}} war <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> were only around 50 mares of the breed left. However, the damage that the property, supplies, and livestock of Mezőhegyes suffered during the war were steadily rebuilt up through the 1960s, and by 1954 there were 120 mares at the Mezőhegyes stud alone. Communist Hungary was not supportive of horseback riding, and in the years between 1947 and 1961, more Hungarian horses were killed for meat than were casualties of the war. Attempts to produce sport-oriented horses from Nonius stock were largely unsuccessful, though during the 1970s combined driving emerged as a popular horse-sport at which the Nonius could excel. In 1989 the Nonius Horse Breeders National Association was formed to protect the purebred Nonius horse. In 1999, UNESCO named the Hortobágy National Park to the World Heritage List (WHL), due in part to its history of livestock breeding, including such breeds as the Nonius horse and Mangalitsa pig. In 2000, the State Stud-Farm Estate of Mezöhegyes was added to the UNESCO Tentative List (which makes it eligible to be nominated for the WHL), due to being a [...] "major centre and organisational example of the highest standard horse-breeding and animal husbandry." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the Revolution <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> {{were still}} {{fractional}} struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions {{such as the}} one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the Cristero War were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo. [...] Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.|$|E

His dabbling in politics brought him more enemies in high positions, and Kingsmill was destined to remain without a ship until April 1782, {{when he took over}} the newly refitted 74-gun third rate [...] Kingsmill was too late to join Admiral Lord Howe's expedition to relieve Gibraltar, and was instead offered command of a reinforcement squadron that was being prepared to sail to the East Indies. He accepted the appointment, which would see him command a squadron consisting of the Elizabeth, the 74-gun , the 64-gun [...] and the 32-gun [...] His force was finally ready to put to sea by 17 January 1783, but while sailing through the Bay of Biscay they encountered heavy gales, and were eventually forced back to Spithead, having suffered considerable damage.
