5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome <b>Wireless</b> <b>Set</b> No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E

25|$|The ships rendezvoused between Iceland and Canada {{with the}} tankers Esso Hamburg and Schlettstadt on 15 February. On 22 February, after {{seven days of}} fruitless searching some 500 {{nautical}} miles east of Newfoundland, German radar picked up five cargo-empty ships from a westbound convoy sailing without escort towards American ports. The convoy identified the German ships and soon the radio waves were busy with signals sent from the frantic British merchantmen, which tried to disperse. The battleships quickly closed and sank four. A further ship, the 5,500-ton Harlesden, carried a powerful <b>wireless</b> <b>set</b> but temporarily evaded them. Intent on silencing it, Lütjens dispatched his Arado Ar 196 to locate it. Upon his return, the Arado pilot reported to have found it and claimed to have destroyed the aerial, but took damage from return fire. Its position now known, the German ships closed in and sank Harlesden at 23:00. The day's haul amounted to around 25,000tons. On a negative note, the chase and action occurred at long range and the expenditure of ammunition was expensive. Lütjens used his radio {{for the first time}} since 8 February and commanded the supply ships Esso Hamburg and Schlettstadt to meet him near the Azores so he could replenish stocks. On 26 February he unloaded 180 prisoners of war onto the tankers Ermland and Friedrich Breme. In the action of 22 February, only 11 Allied sailors had become casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Engineers Signal Service, {{formed in}} 1912, was given {{responsibility}} for communications that included signal dispatch, telegraph, telephone and later wireless communications, from army headquarters to brigade {{and down to}} battery level for the artillery. For most of the war, the Army's primary methods of communication were signal dispatch (employing runners, messengers on horseback, dogs, and carrier pigeons), visual signalling, telegraph, and telephone. At {{the start of the}} war, the Army had a small number of <b>wireless</b> <b>sets,</b> which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated on longwave. In 1915, trench <b>wireless</b> <b>sets</b> were introduced, but the transmissions were easily intercepted by the listening Germans.|$|R

500|$|In the LRP, most of {{the radio}} {{operators}} were New Zealanders, but the LRDG radio operators were all from the Royal Corps of Signals.

All LRDG patrols included one vehicle equipped with a <b>Wireless</b> <b>Set</b> No. 11 and a non-military Philips model 635 receiver.

2500|$|Live cricket {{broadcasting}} {{had begun}} in a limited fashion in 1927, but it was generally thought that ball-by-ball commentary would not work for a game as slow as cricket.

In the mid-1930s he got Marshall to begin commentating on cricket, rather than only giving reports. Marshall was a great success, the poet Edmund Blunden writing: [...] "And then on the air, Mr Howard Marshall makes every ball bowled, every shifting of a fieldsman so fertile with meaning that any <b>wireless</b> <b>set</b> may make a subtle cricket student of anybody." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} network coding across three unicast sessions over a directed acyclic graph, when each session has min-cut one. Previous work by Das et al. adapted a precoding-based interference alignment technique, originally developed for the wireless interference channel, specifically to this problem. We refer to this approach as precoding-based network alignment (PBNA). Similar to the <b>wireless</b> <b>setting,</b> PBNA asymptotically achieves half the minimum cut; different from the <b>wireless</b> <b>setting,</b> its feasibility depends on the graph structure. Das et al. provided a set of feasibility conditions for PBNA {{with respect to a}} particular precoding matrix. However, the set consisted of an infinite number of conditions, which is impossible to check in practice. Furthermore, the conditions were purely algebraic, without interpretation with regards to the graph structure. In this paper, we first prove that the set of conditions provided by Das. et al are also necessary for the feasibility of PBNA with respect to any precoding matrix. Then, using two graph-related properties and a degree-counting technique, we reduce the set to just four conditions. This reduction enables an efficient algorithm for checking the feasibility of PBNA on a given graph. I...|$|R
