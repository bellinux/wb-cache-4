5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after its founding, the Khitan Empire began {{a process of}} territorial expansion, with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae.

5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph.

5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Jacques Hurtubise, Pierre Huet and Hélène Fleury <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> the long-lived, satirical Croc, which {{published}} many leading {{talents of}} the era, {{many of whom}} were able to launch their careers through the magazine's help. Croc begat another magazine, Titanic, dedicated to comic strips, and in 1987, Safarir, a Mad-like publication patterned after the French Hara-Kiri, rose in competition with Croc. By the mid-1980s, a number of professional comics publishers began to flourish.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, Autolink {{canceled}} {{their contract}} with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink {{announced that they}} <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> their own railway company, {{which they had been}} working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because Rail Management would not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink. From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions.|$|E
5|$|Operation Fustain, the division's second {{mission in}} Sicily, {{was carried out}} by the 1st Parachute Brigade. Their {{objective}} was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The intention was for the parachute brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land {{on both sides of the}} river. While one battalion seized the bridge, the other two battalions <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> defensive positions to the north and south. They would then hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, part of the Eighth Army which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} Ibn Mahkan, Salih {{became the}} lord of al-Rahba, and made his allegiance with the Fatimids. Al-Rahba {{was the first major}} territory Salih held and was the touchstone of the emirate he <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> in Aleppo and much of northern Syria. His son Thimal later succeeded him as emir of Aleppo, and al-Rahba became his principal power base from which many of his wazirs (advisers or ministers) originated. He was later compelled by the Fatimids to hand over al-Rahba to their ally Arslan al-Basasiri, a Turkish general who revolted against his Seljuk masters and the Abbasid Caliphate. The ceding of al-Rahba to al-Basasiri was the first step in Thimal's loss of the Mirdasid emirate. Together with the loss of Raqqa, it provoked dissension within the Banu Kilab, with Thimal's brother Atiyya resolving to restore the Mirdasid emirate. Al-Basasiri's revolt ultimately failed and he was killed in 1059, prompting Atiyya to capture al-Rahba in April 1060. Later, in August 1061, Atiyya successfully defended al-Rahba from Numayrid advances.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Kurosawa, {{influenced}} by the democratic ideals of the Occupation, sought to make films that <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> a new respect towards {{the individual and the}} self. The first such film, No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), inspired by both the 1933 Takigawa incident and the Hotsumi Ozaki wartime spy case, criticized Japan's prewar regime for its political oppression. Atypically for the director, the heroic central character is a woman, Yukie (Setsuko Hara), who born into upper-middle-class privilege, comes to question her values in a time of political crisis. The original script had to be extensively rewritten and, because of its controversial theme (and because the protagonist was a woman), the completed work divided critics, but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences, who turned variations on the film's title into a postwar catchphrase.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines {{announced}} in 1985 that it <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> a hub at Nashville, investing $115 million {{to develop a}} new 15-gate concourse and applying for $50 million in federal funds to build a new 10,000-foot runway. The hub was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airlines and Piedmont Airlines for north-south traffic in the eastern United States. American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their hub in Nashville in April 1986. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight to from Nashville to London (flying into Gatwick Airport). The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E

5|$|Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City Oil, Gas and Manufacturing Company for royalties, {{using the}} basis that the second lease was invalid because the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted. After the parties settled out of court, Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located {{at the center of}} Spindletop. This company was {{vulnerable}} to takeover bids due to Higgins' over-zealous land prospecting, which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $3 million. Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land, and <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> the Higgins Standard Oil Company. He later established other wells with various investors, with an eccentric habit of pulling his interests out, leaving the majority of the profits for others.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Florida Legislature {{recognized}} {{demands for}} higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> a campus in Dania Beach in 1997 and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994 to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named for the late John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university's honors college.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> a low-cost airline following {{the opening of the}} new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that <b>would</b> <b>establish</b> cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
