40|$|The {{intermittent}} {{nature of}} the wind resource, together with short-term power fluctuations, are the two principal issues facing a utility with <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in its <b>power</b> grid. To mitigate these issues, utilities, <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> developers, and operators {{need to understand the}} nature of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> fluctuations and how they affect the electrical power system, as well as to analyze ancillary service requirements with real <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> output data. To provide the necessary data, NREL conducted a study to collect at least 2 years of long-term, high-frequency (1 -hertz [Hz]) data from several medium- to large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> with different <b>wind</b> resources, terrain features, and turbine types.

40|$|This Study {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for Economic Dispatch (ED) problems incorporating <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.

40|$|Many {{offshore}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{are being}} developed every year at North and Baltic Sea. From the prospective of environment and integrated European power, combined power transmission from several offshore <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> using VSC-HVDC transmission system to different onshore grids are suitable instead of connecting each <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> individually. Offshore AC hub is beneficial for the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> that are far from shore but {{close to each other}} within the vicinity of 20 km. This paper presents a method of controlling reactive power flow in the offshore AC grid to minimize the power losses and voltage deviation. In the proposed scheme, offshore grid frequency and voltage are controlled through more than one converter. Using frequency and voltage droop schemes, the active and reactive power sharing is achieved among converters. Furthermore, the optimization algorithm is developed to acquire the set points for the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and VSC-HVDC droop gains for the optimum operation of the network.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> of megawatt <b>wind</b> turbines operating in derated mode. When operating in this mode, the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> controller {{is free to}} distribute power set-points to the individual turbines, {{as long as the}} total power demand is met. In this work, we design a controller that exploits this freedom to reduce the fatigue on the turbines in the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> We show that the controller can be designed in a decentralized manner, such that each wind turbine is equipped with a local low-complexity controller relying only on few measurements and little communication. As a basis for the controller design, a linear wind turbine model is constructed and verified in an operational <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> of megawatt turbines. Due to limitations of the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> available for tests, {{it is not possible to}} implement the developed controller; instead the final distributed controller is evaluated via simulations using an industrial wind turbine model.

A two level hierarchical structure, consisting of a <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> controller and <b>wind</b> turbine controllers, may be used. The wind farm controller communicates with higher level control centre and determines the operating points for wind turbines to meet grid demands.
