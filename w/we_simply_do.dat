According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com, [...] "the Saturn {{will go down}} in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time." [...] In 2009, IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, [...] "While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo... Nights into Dreams, the Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite." [...] The staff of Edge noted [...] "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga." [...] In 2015, The Guardians Keith Stuart declared [...] "the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran stated [...] "Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it." [...] IGN's Adam Redsell wrote [...] " [...] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that <b>we</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not see outside of the indie scene today." [...] Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that [...] "The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan... some games, like Enemy Zero used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served." [...] Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party titles as [...] "Sega's shining moment as a game developer", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of [...] "fresh ideas" [...] and [...] "precious few high-profile franchises", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.|$|E

60|$|There {{is a sort}} of improbability {{with which}} we are shocked in {{dramatic}} representation, not less than in a narrative of real life. Consequently, there must be rules respecting it; and as rules are nothing but means to an end previously ascertained--(inattention to which simple truth has been the occasion of all the pedantry of the French school),--we must first determine what the immediate end or object of the drama is. And here, as I have previously remarked, I find two extremes of critical decision;--the French, which evidently presupposes that a perfect delusion is to be aimed at,--an opinion which needs no fresh confutation; and the exact opposite to it, brought forward by Dr. Johnson, who supposes the auditors throughout in the full reflective knowledge of the contrary. In evincing the impossibility of delusion, he makes no sufficient allowance for an intermediate state, which I have before distinguished by the term, illusion, and have attempted to illustrate its quality and character by reference to our mental state, when dreaming.

40|$|Purpose This study {{presents}} a preliminary test of Agnew's {{general theory of}} crime and delinquency. This study examines whether {{each of the five}} life domain variables at the core of Agnew's theory is related to recidivism, whether there is a non-linear relationship between the life domains and recidivism, and whether the five life domains interact in causing recidivism. Methods Data were derived from the baseline survey of the Maryland Boot Camp Experiment and through a criminal records check conducted by the Maryland Department of Public Safety. Results Overall, the results lend weak support for Agnew's general theory. In particular, only two of the five life domains, having a bad job and being a high school dropout, are significantly correlated with recidivism. Further, {{with the exception of the}} peers domain, there is neither a linear nor a non-linear relationship between the life domains and recidivism. The results also reveal that none of the two-way bivariate interactions are significant in a multivariate linear probability model. Conclusions Although our findings are not supportive of Agnew's (2005) general theory of crime, the theory contains many other implications that <b>we</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not have the data to address. ...|$|R

Our project aims at modeling emotions on an autonomous embodied agent, Petra, a more robust robot than our previous prototype- Cherry. Our robot has been equipped with sonar and vision for obstacle avoidance as well as vision for face recognition, which are used when she roams around the hallway to engage in social interactions with humans. The sensory motor level receives and processes inputs and produces emotion-like states without any further willful planning or learning. We describe: (1) the psychological theory of emotion which inspired our design, (2) our proposed agent architecture, (3) the needed hardware additions that we implemented on the commercialized ActivMedia’s robot, (4) Petra’s multi-modal interface designed especially to engage humans in natural (and hopefully pleasant) social interaction, and finally (5) our future research efforts.

Collocation is too often seen as something static, just a relationship between two words, but Firth points to something much more than that, as studies from Phillips (1985) to Williams (1998, 2002) have amply shown. The big problem with collocation is that it has always been with us, but <b>we</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not know it. It has taken big corpora and the insights of Sinclair (1996) to show how important is the idiom principle. What is more, there is often a strange confusion between collocation studies and the phenomenon itself.

At University of Worcester Library Services we have put student voice at the heart of our development and taken a proactive approach to improving student experience. In this presentation, I will share our experience of using the NSS, combined with a more personal and targeted project approach, to engage with even ‘hard to reach’ student groups and improve student experience for all. Despite receiving our highest NSS score to date in 2015 / 16, Library Services were keenly aware that <b>we</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not score so highly with certain student groups and that, to understand this dip in student satisfaction, we would need to adopt an approach that contrasted with the mass-targeting campaigns of the NSS and other university-wide surveys. By personally targeting students from individual subject areas and inviting them to attend small, informal focus groups (with an abundance of sticky notes and the obligatory biscuits), we were able to glean a vast amount of information regarding both course-specific and more general student concerns and identify a number of gaps in student knowledge. These focus groups provided us with invaluable opportunities to reach out to individual student groups and gather information that fed directly into staff and student-facing campaigns and, to complete the feedback loop, we ensured that we kept in touch with participants, including them as recipients of the project report and Library Services’ proposed outcomes. In the longer term, it is hoped that the impact of this project will be measurable through improved 2016 / 17 NSS scores from targeted student groups but, also, through an overall increase in student satisfaction and engagement with Library Services. This presentation will explore this project as a model of engaging with student experience that is simple yet highly effective and, since it requires no specialist resources or staff, one that can be replicated by delegates from a broad range of institutions...|$|R
