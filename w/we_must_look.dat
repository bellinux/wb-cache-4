Gannett of The Nation criticized Townsend {{for writing}} an [...] "apology for Japan" [...] and {{painting}} the Chinese as [...] "all alike, all generically different from Japanese and Westerners". A similarly negative assessment published in The China Weekly Review observed that [...] "A Chinese might easily write a similar book and {{by emphasizing the}} activities of the Capones and Dillingers, the bootleggers, kidnappers and racketeers, prove to his own satisfaction at least that the Americans constituted a degenerate branch of the white race." [...] The Republican concluded its review of the book with [...] "Throughout the presentation of his observations runs a thread of ill-considered bias which taints his words. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> to other... more discerning writers for the truth about China." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of natural resources—"their ecologies were unable to regenerate." [...] The other two failed in their heartlands, [...] "where ecological demand was highest," [...] but left remnant populations that survived. He asks the question: [...] "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well." [...] For the answer, he says, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> to natural regeneration and human migration (Wright, 102). [...] While some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled. The other factor, evident in both Egypt and China, was that due to abundant resources (e.g., topsoil), farming methods (ones that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles), and settlement patterns, these civilizations had greater longevity (103-104).|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create a balance in the track listing, Lafourcade wrote [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] as a [...] "simple song" [...] about wanting to be with someone. The track was co-written by Marian Ruzzi, and was {{inspired}} by the music of the 1970s, including a chorus with answering voices, emulating musical theatre. The lyrics for [...] "Lo Que Construimos", deals with the decision to leave someone and going separate ways. [...] "Estoy Lista" [...] is a ballad about being ready to be well, and Lafourcade worked on the track in her spare time, taking a year to finish it. The last track, [...] "No Más Llorar", was written during a family reunion with her father and sister in Chile. Lafourcade wrote it about a love that could not be, her mourning and search for stability, forgiveness, and healing. In live performances, the singer dedicates the track to Mexico, to send hope through her music and help people deal with situations such as the Iguala mass kidnapping. [...] "I feel that nowadays is really important that we acknowledge the social part. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> inward and work, see which aspects we can address to deliver something more positive to the world".|$|E

2500|$|El Greco's painting, which Picasso studied {{repeatedly}} in Zuloaga's house, inspired {{not only the}} size, format, and composition of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, but it inspired its apocalyptic power. Later, speaking of the work to Dor de la Souchère in Antibes, Picasso said: [...] "In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for the Spanish influence in Cézanne.

2500|$|In 1960, the United States {{attempted}} {{to weaken the}} Cuban Economy by bombing {{thousands of acres of}} sugarcane fields. After the USSR and Cuba reestablished their diplomatic relations in May 1960, the USSR began to buy Cuban sugar in exchange for oil. When oil refineries like, Shell, Texaco, and Esso refused to refine Soviet oil, Castro nationalized that industry as well, taking over the refineries on the island. Days later in response, the United States cut the Cuban Sugar Quota completely, Eisenhower was quoted saying [...] "This action amounts to economic sanctions against, Cuba.

2500|$|Carl D. Atkins {{argues that}} readers are misinterpreting {{the type of}} love {{depicted}} in the sonnets as homosexual. He believes that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> at it with an eye that considers the concepts of love in Shakespeare's time. He sees {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man as a passionate friendship that is more pure than heterosexual relationships and in some cases can even take precedence over marriage. [...] He puts an emphasis in distinguishing between intellectual lover, or love of the mind, and animal love, or love of the body. The sonnets are writing about a pure platonic form of love and modern readers are injecting too much sexual politics into his or her criticism. Atkins sees the sonnets more as a chronicle of underlying emotions experienced by lovers of all kinds whether it is heterosexual, homosexual or passionate friendship: adoration, longing, jealousy, disappointment, grief, reconciliation, and understanding.|$|E

The rule changes for 1909 {{included}} reducing {{the value of}} a field goal (whether by drop kick or place kick) from four points to three points. [...] Michigan's Board in Control of Athletics also re-established a freshman football team in 1909 after the freshman football program had been ceased four years earlier. [...] Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost said at the time, [...] "It is to the freshmen that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for our future Michigan teams and I am glad that it has been decided to allow us to have such a team. [...] Under competent coaching such as they will have the men will learn a lot about the Michigan style of playing and this will be invaluable when they come up for the Varsity team in future years." [...] Prentiss Douglass was hired as the coach of the freshman team, and he led the freshman to a 5-0 record.|$|E
2500|$|A 1947 {{report by}} an {{official}} inspector {{who visited the}} Home says {{some of the children}} were suffering from malnutrition, and 12 out of 31 infants examined were described as being [...] "emaciated and not thriving". It also says that the Home was overcrowded, with 271 children and 61 mothers living there. Death rates were extraordinarily high: 34 per cent of children died in the home in 1943; 25 per cent died in 1944; [...] 23 per cent died in 1945; 27 per cent died in 1946. [...] The report states [...] "The death rate amongst infants is high... The death rate had appeared to be on the decrease but has now begun to rise again.

2500|$|The Symbolists, and Pablo Picasso {{during his}} blue period, {{drew on the}} cold {{tonality}} of El Greco, utilizing the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, he visited his friend Ignacio Zuloaga in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's Opening of the Fifth Seal (owned by Zuloaga since 1897). The relation between Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Opening of the Fifth Seal was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities {{and the relationship between}} the motifs of both works were analysed. According to art historian John Richardson Les Demoiselles d'Avignon [...] "turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as Cézanne". Picasso said about Demoiselles d'Avignon, [...] "in any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for the Spanish influence in Cézanne.

2500|$|The Ultra-Tories {{peaked in}} {{strength}} about 1819-1822 then lost ground inside the Tory Party. They were defeated in important breakthroughs {{that took place}} in the late 1820s in terms of tolerating first dissenting Protestants. An even more decisive blow was the unexpected repeal of the many restrictions on Catholics, after widespread organized protest by the Catholic Association in Ireland under Daniel O’Connell, with support from Catholics in England. [...] Sir Robert Peel was alarmed at the strength of the Catholic Association, warning in 1824, [...] "We cannot tamely sit by [...] while the danger is hourly increasing, while a power co-ordinate with that of the Government is rising by its side, nay, daily counteracting its views." [...] Prime Minister Wellington, Britain's most famous war hero, told Peel, [...] "If we cannot get rid of the Catholic Association, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>look</b> to Civil War in Ireland sooner or later." [...] Peel and Wellington agreed that to stop the momentum of the Catholic [...] Association it was necessary to pass Catholic emancipation, which gave Catholics the vote and the right to sit in Parliament. That happened in 1829 using Whig support. Passage demonstrated that the veto power long held by the ultra-Tories no longer was operational, and significant reforms were now possible across the board. The stage was set for the Age of Reform.|$|E
