5|$|<b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? was {{released}} on September 27, 2011, by Hunt's independent record label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} Nashville-based distributor Thirty Tigers. It was distributed by RED Distribution. Thirty Tigers reached out to Hunt during 2009 and offered their distribution and marketing services to him pending the album's completion. He subsequently assembled a marketing team and Godless Hotspot. <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? was executive-produced by music manager and executive Randy Jackson, who originally helped Hunt get his first major-label record contract in 2003. The album's cover is a photograph taken by Hunt in North Hollywood that depicts an elderly woman looking askance at a collection of white garbage bags set against a concrete wall. The interior packaging of the album also features Hunt's photography, including a kaleidoscopic collage of photographed subjects in the fold-out CD booklet.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{produced}} by Hunt, <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? expands on his previous work's blend of R and rock music forms. Hunt sought {{to achieve a}} rawer musical aesthetic and incorporated rough rhythms, rock dynamics, and studio effects. Inspired by Hunt's experience in Los Angeles {{at the onset of}} the late-2000s recession, the album's subject matter deals with issues in contemporary society and dissonance in modern life. Music writers have noted the album for its predominantly rock style, incorporation of funk and soul, eccentric songs, varying musical structure, and Hunt's eclectic vocal range.|$|E

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Van Hunt, released September 27, 2011, on his independent label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} distributor Thirty Tigers. It is the follow-up to Hunt's 2006 album On the Jungle Floor and follows a period of label conflict and mainstream obscurity for Hunt. Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles, where Hunt applied a minimalist recording approach and worked with a backing band comprising drummer Ruth Price, percussionist Melissa Mattey, and keyboardist Peter Dyer.|$|E
500|$|Hunt {{began working}} on tracks for a {{follow-up}} project in 2008. Two songs from those sessions, [...] "Moving Targets" [...] and [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", were included on <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For?. After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{subsequently}} recorded basic tracks, and Hunt approached Peter Dyer {{to create}} a backing soundscape for the tracks. <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? was later mixed by Melissa Mattey. Hunt has cited its minimalist recording process as his [...] "most hands off approach ... thus far on an album", calling the approach [...] "musically adept but also stringently unique. People might describe it as futuristic." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from music critics, who praised its musical direction, Hunt's performance, and his songwriting. However, it received some backlash from Hunt's fanbase for its stylistic departure {{from his past}} work. The album produced one single, [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", and performed modestly on music charts, reaching number 50 on the Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Hunt promoted What You Were Hoping For? with a national tour that spanned September to October 2011, and featured session band members Ruth Price and Peter Dyer.|$|E
500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When people talk about the distortion on the guitar, I hear the same thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|Expanding on his {{previous}} work's blend of R and rock music forms, <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? incorporates hard rock, lively funk, sparse ballads, and elements of soul, punk rock, and progressive rock. The music has a loose feel, with grittier guitar and more low fidelity production than on Hunt's previous albums. The album's songs are primarily guitar-based and contain jagged, rumbling rhythms, loose guitar riffs, funk licks, and studio effects, including an adundant use of reverb. Their musical structures {{are characterized by}} eccentric arrangements, shifting melodies, and rhythms that vary at offbeat intervals. The songs also feature tense, aggressive soundscapes with sonic influences derived from 1960s psychedelic music and 1970s rock music. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News notes the prevalence of rock music on the album and describes its music as [...] "a surrealist's notion of soul: prog-rock swayed by R ... Lots of songs have the skewed melodic structures of '70s Zappa, tempered by '80s Red Hot Chili Peppers." [...] Geraud Blanks of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel characterizes the album's music as [...] "an amalgamation of Prince's psychedelic funk, Jimi Hendrix rock and Curtis Mayfield soul". Hunt's falsetto vocals on the album feature silky timbre and style. He sings {{in a variety of}} musical modes on the songs.|$|E

500|$|Hunt's songwriting on {{the album}} is {{characterized}} by resolute lyrics, multi-layered storylines, social commentary, a droll perspective, poetic subtlety, thematic subtext, and whimsy. Songs {{on the album}} are unified by a theme of tension and dissonance in modern life. The songs explore topics and issues in contemporary society and culture, including gentrification, identity politics, and mass consumption, accompanied {{by a sense of}} hope in Hunt's lyrics. Hunt explains the album to have a [...] "loose concept", with songs unified by subject matter concerning [...] "unspoken issues around society", and says of his lyrical sentiments on the album, [...] "It fits my personality that no matter what's going on I'm going to answer it honestly with a wink and a smile. As cliché as it might be, I feel like every situation needs a laugh." [...] L. Michael Gipson of Creative Loafing notes David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz as references points for Hunt's songwriting, and writes that <b>What</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? explores [...] "both sides of the political aisles" [...] with metaphorical songs such as [...] "North Hollywood", [...] "Designer Jeans", and the title track, as well as themes concerning an intimate relationship with the songs [...] "Moving Targets", [...] "Falls (Violet)", and [...] "Cross Dresser".|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali's example {{inspired}} countless black Americans and others. The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, [...] "Ali's actions {{changed my}} standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot {{or the ability}} to stop on a dime was no longer enough. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> doing for the liberation of your people? <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Howe's family {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on its members' reading and writing: [...] "Thanksgivings and family occasions were always about, 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> reading, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> writing, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> working on, <b>what</b> poetry <b>are</b> <b>you</b> interested in?'" [...] When Howe was ill with hepatitis, her father visited her {{every day in the}} hospital, reading James Joyce's Ulysses to her during his lunch break.|$|R
