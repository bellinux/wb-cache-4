5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of alpaca {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E

25|$|This event {{would involve}} 22 buffalo hunters led by James Harvey who <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a buffalo herd {{and who were}} raided by about 40 Comanche warriors led by Red Young Man. While the buffalo hunters were seeking revenge, Troop A, of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Concho, led by Nolan and First Lieutenant Charles S. Cooper, with 61 African-American enlisted men would begin an {{unsuccessful}} pursuit of Comanche Indian raiders with the hunters.|$|E
25|$|Accusations and recriminations flew around. Some {{civilians were}} {{angry at the}} Germans, some at the British for abandoning them and many at other civilians for how they had behaved. Investigators turned up looking for war crimes. The bulk of civilians <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> work, {{rebuilding}} their strength with the improved food and medicines now available and {{trying to pick up}} their lives after five years of occupation. There was also {{a lot of work to}} do repairing damaged houses.|$|E
25|$|Isis and {{her sister}} Nephthys <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> these pieces, but could only find {{thirteen}} of the fourteen. Fish had swallowed the last piece, his phallus. With Thoth's help she created a golden phallus, and attached it to Osiris’s body. She then transformed into a kite, and {{with the aid of}} Thoth’s magic conceived Horus the Younger. The number of pieces is described on temple walls variously as fourteen and sixteen, one for each nome or district.|$|E

25|$|Following his one-day {{career in}} the {{industrial}} world, Leavitt <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> other employment. He landed his first newspaper job at age 17 when he began writing for The Bangor Daily Commercial in 1934. At the outbreak of World War II, Leavitt joined the Army Air Corps as a civilian employee. Following the War, in 1946 Leavitt {{took a job as}} general sportswriter at The Bangor Daily News, with which he associated as sportswriter, sports editor and outdoor columnist for the next 48 years.|$|E
25|$|Denny and Whittier <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> bankers {{to provide}} bridge financing, {{and one of}} these put them in touch with Whitney Collins, a {{vice-president}} at Menasco Motors Company and budding entrepreneur. Collins and Denny estimated it would take somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 to bring the RP-3 up to the performance demanded by the original $11,000 contract, but Collins {{was willing to take}} a chance that this would lead to future business. Collins and his partner Harold Powell split the drone program off from Reginald Denny Hobby Shops and formed Radioplane with Denny and Whittier. Whittier was later bought out.|$|E
25|$|Knievel {{realized}} {{that to make}} any amount of real money {{he would need to}} hire more performers, stunt coordinators and other personnel so that he could concentrate on the jumps. With little money, he <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a sponsor and found one in Bob Blair, owner of ZDS Motors, Inc., the West coast distributor for Berliner Motor Corporation, a distributor for Norton Motorcycles. Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{result was}} that the Northern Pacific was left without a direct connection to Chicago, the primary interchange point {{for most of the}} large U.S. railroads. Fortunately, the Northern Pacific was not alone. James J. Hill, controller of the Great Northern, which was completed between the Twin Cities and Puget Sound in 1893, also lacked a direct connection to Chicago. Hill <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a road with an existing route between the Twin Cities and Chicago which could be rolled into his holdings and give him a stable path to that important interchange. At the same time, Edward Henry Harriman, head of the Union Pacific Railroad, was also looking for a road which could connect his company to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|With his assault {{schedule}} {{thrown out}} of whack by the PAVN, and his troops consequently in trouble, Vang Pao <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> help. On 1 September, he made an emergency flight to Vientiane for a tense meeting with Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley at the airfield. Hoping to cadge more air support, the general blamed a shortage of tactical air for the offensive's lack of success. From Godley's standpoint, the Hmong unit commanders left much to be desired for combat leadership of a force crippled by trench foot. The ambassador {{made it clear that}} U.S. tactical air support was limited to 18 daily sorties. He then asked if Vang Pao would continue the offensive on those terms. At this, Vang Pao returned to battle, knowing that saving Long Tieng was essential for the Royalists.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, while Gunn {{was out of}} town, Bogan again went on a rampage. When Gunn returned, and learned of this, he <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> Bogan, and warned him that if this {{happened}} again, he would arrest Bogan. To this, Bogan replied {{that he would do}} as he pleased. Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several occasions, as a man who would not back down nor be intimidated, and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.|$|E

25|$|In the off-season, the Flyers <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a new goaltender. Burke {{was let go}} and Hextall {{was about}} to enter his final season as a backup. They chose to sign former Panther John Vanbiesbrouck over former Oiler Curtis Joseph, who ended up signing with Toronto. The 1998–99 season was marred by a {{life-threatening}} injury sustained by Eric Lindros on April Fools' Day during {{a game against the}} Nashville Predators, a season-ending injury later diagnosed as a collapsed lung. Up until that point, Lindros was having an MVP-type season with 40 goals and 53 assists in 71 games. Without Lindros, the Flyers had trouble scoring in the playoffs even after having re-acquired Mark Recchi at the trade deadline. Although Vanbiesbrouck allowed nine goals to Joseph's eleven allowed, the Flyers lost their first round series with Toronto in six games.|$|E
25|$|After occupying Cuenca, Victor {{determined}} that the Army of the Center was out of reach. The marshal then <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> Palacios' division at Villaharta. When Palacios heard of the Uclés debacle, he withdrew to the Sierra Morena. Finding that his prey escaped, Victor occupied Madridejos. Deeming the Spanish people sufficiently cowed by the victory at Uclés, Napoleon finally allowed his brother Joseph to make a triumphal entry into his capital at Madrid. The spectacle occurred on 22 January after which King Joseph entered his palace. Under threat, Joseph's Spanish subjects swore fealty to their new king. After marching to join Palacios at the Despeñaperros Pass, Infantado was removed from command for failing to support Venegas. General Tomás de Morla y Pacheco, 3rd Conde de Cartaojal assumed command of the Army of the Center. The next action was the Battle of Ciudad Real on 27 March 1809.|$|E
25|$|Half-Wits Holiday (released 1947) {{would be}} Curly's final {{appearance}} {{as an official}} member of the Stooges. During filming on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White's chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When Curly was called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> his brother: he found Curly with his head dropped to his chest. Moe later recalled that his mouth was distorted and {{he was unable to}} speak, only cry. Moe quietly alerted White to all this, leading the latter to rework the scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Curly spent several weeks at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California before returning home for further recuperation.|$|E

25|$|In early 1984, Ben Baker was {{planning}} on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the McDonnell Douglas automotive division in St. Louis. Baker {{was part of the}} CP/M special interest group within the club. He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, CBBS system, and <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that DEC would be giving them a Rainbow 100 computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two processors, an Intel 8088 and a Zilog Z80, allowing it to run both MS-DOS and CP/M, with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the I/O ports, so CBBS could not communicate with a modem. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.|$|E
25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it. Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several tried to see whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's turn to see if he could fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
25|$|In January 1810, the 23,140-man III Corps was {{organized}} into three infantry divisions under Laval, Musnier, and Habert, and a cavalry brigade under General of Brigade André Joseph Boussart. With 11 battalions and 7,173 effectives, Musnier's 2nd Division {{was the largest}} formation in the corps. Suchet planned to operate against Mequinenza and Lérida. Instead, King Joseph Bonaparte ordered him to advance against Valencia. Because Joseph's forces {{were in the process}} of overrunning Andalusia against spotty resistance, the king believed that the Spanish armies were in a state of collapse. Reluctantly, Suchet set out for Valencia and reached there on 6 March. He found its Spanish defenders full of fight and found it necessary to abandon the futile mission four days later. Back in Aragon, Suchet spent some time suppressing guerillas before moving against Lérida. He arrived before the city on 15 April. After finding that General Henry O'Donnell was marching to the city's relief, Suchet took Musnier's division and <b>went</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the hostile army. The two forces missed each other and Musnier returned to the vicinity of Lérida on the night of 22 April.|$|E
