5|$|A brief {{fashion for}} men wearing snood-scarf neckwarmers ended in 2011 when the IFAB banned them as {{potentially}} dangerous. A ban on women wearing the hijab {{was introduced by}} the IFAB in 2007, but lifted in 2012 after pressure from Prince Ali of Jordan. In keeping with French views, the French Football Federation said it <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> its ban.|$|E
5|$|Agrium Vanscoy Potash Operations is Canada's {{third largest}} {{producer}} of potash fertilizer. In the 1930s early homesteaders <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> Highway 7 {{as a means}} to supplement their income. Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for direction of travel with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines. Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|An anniversary {{service was}} held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local {{hospital}} <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.|$|E

5|$|Arthur {{was murdered}} (allegedly by John), {{and his sister}} Eleanor would {{spend the rest of}} her life in captivity. John's {{behaviour}} drove a number of French barons to side with Philip, and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John's control of his continental possessions—the de facto end of the Angevin Empire, although Henry III <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> his claim until 1259.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{appears to}} have entered service in August 1859, {{carrying}} mail, passengers and specie between New York and New Orleans, with an intermediate stop at Havana, Cuba. She <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> a regular service on this route, making a round trip about once a month, until shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War in April 1861.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had {{little interest in}} raising a child, but may have felt that having one <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> her connection to him. In July 1925 she gave birth to their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans {{had been made}} for a proposed 27th season {{under the assumption that}} it <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts as part of their The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), who was never named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
5|$|In response, English Heritage and Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council {{formed a}} {{three-way}} agreement in 1988 with the Ivanhoe Trust, a local charity designed to generate new {{employment in the}} region. Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre {{was built in the}} style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit the erosion of the castle stonework.|$|E

50|$|Minor raids by the Wazirs and forays by British forces {{continued}} into 1921, however, following the 1919-20 campaign, the British decided upon {{a change of}} strategy in Waziristan. It was determined that a permanent garrison of regular troops <b>would</b> be <b>maintained</b> {{in the region to}} work much more closely with the militia units that were being reconstituted following the troubles that occurred during the 1919 war with Afghanistan. As part of this policy, it was decided that a garrison <b>would</b> be <b>maintained</b> at Razmak.|$|R

5|$|Jeremy Wilkin as Virgil Tracy. David Holliday, the {{original}} voice of Virgil, {{had returned to}} the United States in the interim between the production of Series One and Thunderbirds Are Go. For the films and Series Two, the character was voiced by Wilkin, an English-born Canadian actor who emigrated back to London in the 1960s. Wilkin <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> a professional relationship with the Andersons for seven years after the film, voicing the character of Captain Ochre in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, supporting roles in Joe 90 and The Bishop in The Secret Service, as well as making minor appearances in the live-action Anderson productions Doppelgänger, UFO and The Protectors.|$|E
5|$|NATO members {{agreed to}} end the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which began its mission in 1996. NATO {{stressed}} that it <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> {{a presence in the}} country to assist in certain areas such as defence reform, or the pursuit of persons indicted for war crimes. Heads of State and Government also welcomed a decision by the European Union to establish a follow-on mission, which would take over the 7,500-member mission and which will be supported by NATO under existing NATO-EU agreements.|$|E
5|$|On February 22, 1947, Crisp {{was hired}} to serve as line coach at Tulane under head coach Henry Frnka.

5|$|The {{company was}} granted a 20-year charter on March 18, 1840, by the Maryland {{legislature}} and then acquired three of the former Maryland & Virginia's steamboats: Pocahontas, Georgia, and Jewess. The company began overnight paddlewheel steamship passenger and freight service daily except Sundays between Baltimore and Norfolk. By 1848, the company's steamship Herald was making the trip in less than 12hours, a time which the line <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> until the end in 1962. An affiliate, the Powhatan Line, started service between Norfolk and Richmond in 1845, interchanging freight and passengers with the Old Bay Line.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 – April 12, 1897) was an American {{paleontologist}} {{and comparative}} anatomist, {{as well as}} a noted herpetologist and ichthyologist. He was a founder of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought. Born to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science; he published his first scientific paper at the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations. Cope married his cousin and had one child; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield, New Jersey, although Cope <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> a residence and museum in Philadelphia in his later years.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} his good form into 2002, where his run-scoring earned him {{an invitation to}} play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans. He scored 77 in a drawn match, and would later that season make his Test match debut against India. However, following his Test debut, he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year. He <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> his place in the Test side against Zimbabwe the following year, despite only scoring one innings of note129 against the Cambridge students. However, after being dropped from the side, Key's form seemed to improve: he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory, and consistently scored around 40runs per innings {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Andres {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that entered the eastern Pacific basin on June16 after crossing Central America. Over the following few days, showers and thunderstorms began to organize around the wave. At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclone formation. By June20, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} roughly 175mi (280km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Around 1200UTC the following day, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression Two-E. The depression briefly track westward before turning towards the northwest, a track which it <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> for the remained of its existence, due to a mid-tropospheric ridge located northeast of the system.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iselle was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall on the Big Island of Hawaii in recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the annual hurricane season, Iselle developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of Mexico on July31, 2014. Assuming a west-northwest course that it <b>would</b> <b>maintain</b> throughout its existence, generally favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for gradual strengthening, with the cyclone attaining hurricane status a day after formation. Continued strengthening progressed for several days up until August4, when Iselle reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg), making it a Category4hurricane. Thereafter, Iselle encountered hostile environmental conditions and quickly weakened before making landfall on the Big Island on August8 as a moderate tropical storm. Its passage over the island disrupted the cyclone, and Iselle later dissipated on August9.|$|E
