25|$|The very {{existence}} of the outer <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> a base mockery, a cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless beauty. I hated flowers, for I had seen the enameled meads of Paradise; I cursed the rocks because they were mute stone, the sky because it rang with no music; and the earth and sky seemed to throw back my curse....|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organised labour. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the <b>world,</b> <b>seemed</b> increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers – including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold – became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
500|$|During the Seven Days Battles that {{followed}} in late June, Longstreet had operational command of {{nearly half of}} Lee's army15 brigadesas it drove McClellan back down the Peninsula. Longstreet performed aggressively and well in his new, larger command, particularly at Gaines' Mill and Glendale. Lee's army in general suffered from weak performances by Longstreet's peers, including, uncharacteristically, Stonewall Jackson, {{and was unable to}} destroy the Union Army. Moxley Sorrel wrote of Longstreet's confidence and calmness in battle: [...] "He was like a rock in steadiness when sometimes in battle the <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> flying to pieces." [...] Gen. Lee said, [...] "Longstreet was the staff in my right hand." [...] He had been established as Lee's principal lieutenant.|$|E

500|$|Harrison began {{sessions}} for his Living in the Material World album in October 1972, at Apple Studio in London. As {{a result of}} the problems associated with the Bangladesh project, author Peter Doggett writes, [...] "verything connected with the physical <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to annoy him." [...] The studio manager at the time, former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick, recalls Harrison wearing his Hindu prayer bag and [...] "mumbling away, chanting his mantra", often unable to reply to questions put to him. As for all the tracks on the album, the recording engineer on [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)" [...] was Phil McDonald, who had also worked in that capacity for the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|The {{lifetime}} of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (17591797) encompassed {{most of the}} second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to see the end of the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: [...] "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race." ...|$|E
500|$|The pay-what-you-want release, {{the first}} for a major act, made {{headlines}} worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. According to Mojo, the release was [...] "hailed as {{a revolution in the}} way major bands sell their music", and the media's reaction was [...] "almost overwhelmingly positive". Time called it [...] "easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business" [...] and Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years." [...] The NME wrote that [...] "the music <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to judder several rimes off its axis", and praised the fact that everyone, from fans to critics, had access to the album at the same time on release day: [...] "the kind of moment of togetherness you don’t get very often." [...] Singer Bono of U2 praised Radiohead as [...] "courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience".|$|E

500|$|To {{mark the}} 30th {{anniversary of the}} album's release, Harrison {{supervised}} a remastered edition of All Things Must Pass, which was issued in January 2001, {{less than a year}} before his death from cancer at the age of 58. The reissue appeared on Gnome Records, a label specifically set up by him for the project. Harrison oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein's album artwork, which included a colorised [...] "George & the Gnomes" [...] front cover and, on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet, further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary, gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape. The latter series served to illustrate Harrison's dismay at [...] "the direction the <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> headed {{at the start of the}} millennium", Gary Tillery observes, a direction that was [...] "so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties". Harrison launched a website dedicated to the reissue, which offered, in the description of Chuck Miller of Goldmine magazine, [...] "graphics and sounds and little Macromedia-created gnomes dancing and giggling and playing guitars in a Terry Gilliam-esque world". As a further example of his willingness to embrace modern media, Harrison prepared an electronic press kit, which he described as [...] "not exactly an EPK but it is a threat to world order as we know it".|$|E

This symbolism is reflected in the patterns of fishing nets, textiles, pottery and goldwork. As the web of channels was the place where daily life took place, so also did people and animals appear in the metallic fabric of cast semi-filigree earrings.|$|E

But he receives a letter containing military intelligence about the Turkish Pasha, Seid.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1920s, most German Jews were {{loyal to}} Germany, assimilated and {{relatively}} prosperous. They served in the German army and contributed to every field of German science, business and culture. After the Nazis were elected to power in 1933, the state-sponsored anti-Semitic persecution such as the Nuremberg Laws (1935) and the Kristallnacht (1938) drove masses of German Jews to seek asylum abroad, but as Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, [...] "The <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to be divided into two parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Well, we had {{not much}} to say in favour of the {{constitution}} of the Reich; we admitted that it consisted entirely of lawful misuses, but it rose therefore the higher over the present French constitution which is operating in a maze of unlawful misuses, whose government displays its energies in the wrong places and therefore has to face the challenge that a thorough change in the state of affairs is widely prophesied.

The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the <b>world,</b> <b>seemed</b> increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation [...] and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, and Matthew Arnold—became early influential critics of social injustice. The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|These laws {{resulted}} in the exclusion of Jews from German social and political life. Many sought asylum abroad; hundreds of thousands emigrated, but as Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, [...] "The <b>world</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{be divided into two}} parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter." [...] The international Évian Conference on 6 July 1938 addressed the issue of Jewish and Gypsy immigration to other countries. By the time the conference took place, more than 250,000 Jews had fled Germany and Austria, which had been annexed by Germany in March 1938; more than 300,000 German and Austrian Jews continued to seek refuge and asylum from oppression. As the number of Jews and Gypsies wanting to leave increased, the restrictions against them grew, with many countries tightening their rules for admission. By 1938, Germany [...] "had entered a new radical phase in anti-Semitic activity". Some historians believe that the Nazi government had been contemplating a planned outbreak of violence against the Jews and were waiting for an appropriate provocation; there is evidence of this planning dating to 1937. In a 1997 interview, the German historian Hans Mommsen claimed that a major motive for the pogrom was the desire of the Gauleiters of the NSDAP to seize Jewish property and businesses. Mommsen stated: ...|$|E
