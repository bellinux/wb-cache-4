50|$|Single-minded fielders often {{crash into}} a wall {{trying to make a}} catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are {{typically}} padded for extra safety. <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads {{on the walls of the}} tight left and right field corners in foul ground.|$|R
2500|$|However, from 1969–1984, the LCS were five-game series {{played in}} a 2-3 format. [...] The NL West and AL East champs hosted {{the first two games}} in odd years and the NL East and the AL West hosted the first two games in even years. [...] Thus, no changes were made to the NLCS {{schedule}} due to <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> lack of lights.|$|R
5|$|On May 17, 2009, Rodríguez hit his 300th career {{home run}} off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Rich Harden at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field.</b> On June 17, 2009, Rodríguez passed Carlton Fisk {{for the most}} games caught in a career; the game was against his former team (the Rangers) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at a Chicago {{hospital}} on January 23, 2015, eight days before his 84th birthday. Following a public visitation, a memorial service was held at the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Several well-known people spoke at the service, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and baseball personalities Joe Torre and Billy Williams. After the service, a procession moved from Downtown Chicago past <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{have played}} in three home ball parks. They played their first season in <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> which was {{designed}} to look like <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> in Chicago, but never played an Opening Day home game there. In 1962, they moved to Dodger Stadium, but only stayed there through 1965. They played two Opening Day games at Dodger Stadium, winning once and losing once. The Angels finally moved to Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 1966, which was first called Anaheim Stadium, then subsequently renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim later. They have played 29 Opening Day games there, and their starting pitchers have 15wins and 12losses with 2no decisions. This makes their record at home in Opening Day games 15wins and 13losses with 2no decisions. In Opening Day games on the road, their starting pitchers have a record of 10wins and 5losses with 5no decisions.|$|E
50|$|Coincidentally, one of <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> {{boundary}} streets was Avalon Boulevard (east, behind {{right field}} {{and a small}} parking lot). The other boundaries of the block were 41st Street (north, behind left field), 42nd Place (south, behind first base), and San Pedro Street (west, behind third base and a larger parking lot). Not only did L.A. Wrigley get its name first, it had more on-site parking than the Chicago version did (or does now).|$|R
50|$|August 19 - Jim Maloney walks ten Cubs, {{none of whom}} score. Leo Cárdenas hits a {{home run}} off of the <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> left field foul pole in the tenth inning for the game's only run; winning the no hitter for Maloney. It was Maloney's second 10 inning no-hitter of the season; he lost the first one 1-0 when the Mets scored a run on two hits {{in the bottom of}} the 11th inning.|$|R
50|$|In early 2016, Fannie May {{decided to}} sponsor another famous Chicago team. They became {{partners}} with the 2017 World Series Champions, the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs announced before the 2016 season that Wrigley Field was undergoing some changes, {{but would be}} up and running before the home opener. One of these changes included a marketing opportunity for Fannie may. Replacing the Budweiser Suite is the Fannie May Bleacher Suite. <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> largest luxury suite holds roughly 70-100 people and gives them a view of center field. The suite also offers amenities as well.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, {{when the}} Cubs won the NL East division, the club named Banks an honorary team member. At the 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, {{the first one}} held at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> since Banks' playing days, he threw out the {{ceremonial}} first pitch to starting catcher Mike Scioscia. Banks {{was named to the}} Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In the same year, the Society for American Baseball Research listed him 27th on a list of the 100 greatest baseball players.|$|E
5|$|On September 3 at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> in a 3-2 {{win over}} the Chicago Cubs, Bumgarner won his second {{game of the season}} facing the {{eventual}} World Series Champion Chicago Cubs and out-dueled their defending Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta, who much like Bumgarner is also a candidate again for the award this season. Bumgarner struck out ten batters and walked nobody, notching his thirtieth career double-digit strikeout game, surpassing Christy Mathewson's twenty-nine for second place in Giants franchise history behind only former rotation mate Tim Lincecum's thirty-six.|$|E
5|$|The game's city {{environment}} is modeled after Chicago, including {{many of its}} landmarks, such as the 'L', the Willis Tower (then known as the Sears Tower), <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects into which the player can crash, including trash bins, parking meters, mailboxes, and traffic lights. In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is {{under no obligation to}} obey them.|$|E
50|$|Wrigley is now {{the only}} {{professional}} ballpark with an ivy covered outfield wall. Several now-demolished ballparks featured ivy in the playing area, including Forbes <b>Field,</b> <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> namesake in Los Angeles, and Bush Stadium (formerly Perry Stadium) in Indianapolis. Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium, the former home of the College World Series as well as minor league baseball, had an ivy-covered brick wall that was replaced with a padded wall. Some ballparks feature ivy on out-of-play walls, especially as a covering for the batter's eye behind the center field fence.|$|R
5000|$|On October 1, 1932, in game {{three of}} the World Series between the Cubs and the New York Yankees, Babe Ruth {{allegedly}} stepped to the plate, pointed his finger to <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> center field bleachers and hit a long home run to center. There is speculation {{as to whether the}} [...] "facts" [...] surrounding the story are true or not, but nevertheless Ruth did help the Yankees secure a World Series win that year and the home run accounted for his 15th and last home run in the post season before he retired in 1935.|$|R
5000|$|Even in retirement, Brickhouse {{maintained}} {{a high profile}} as a Cubs and WGN ambassador. He would occasionally return to the booth for special events, such as <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> annual [...] "70's Night". He also guested with Harry Caray when the Cubs secured their first postseason berth in 39 years, as they clinched the 1984 National League Eastern Division title in Pittsburgh. The Cubs won {{the first two games}} of the League Championship Series at Wrigley but lost three games to the Padres in San Diego, once again failing to win the pennant (1984 was the last year in which the LCS was only a best-of-five series). Brickhouse hosted his own weekly segment on WGN's localized version of WCW Pro in the early 1990s called [...] "Brickhouse's Bonus." ...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2009, at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since. The league expanded its offerings of outdoor games with the introduction of the NHL Stadium Series in 2014. Since the inaugural Winter Classic, the NHL has held 13 additional outdoor games.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–06 season, rookies Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby {{began their}} careers. In their first three seasons, they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies; Crosby in 2007, and Ovechkin in 2008. The {{success of the}} Heritage Classic led to the {{scheduling}} of more outdoor games. The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings. The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers. The home team Bruins won.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies {{left-hander}} Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the historic <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field.</b> He narrowly missed completing a perfect game by walking two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long fly ball hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able to snag the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, who now has tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Cubs' 2007 season, two {{different}} efforts were undertaken to upgrade the playing field at the old ballpark. A few years earlier, a Sports Illustrated poll found that the players considered <b>Wrigley's</b> playing <b>field</b> {{to be one of the}} poorest in the Major Leagues. The renovations should go a long way toward fixing that situation.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1927, {{he signed}} a {{contract}} to play professional football for the New York Yankees team organized by sports promoter, C. C. Pyle, and featuring Red Grange. [...] He played for the Yankees through the complete 1927-1928 season. He scored the Yankees' only touchdown in a 7-0 win on <b>Wrigley</b> baseball <b>field</b> in Los Angeles in January 1928.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{highlights}} as the Portsmouth Spartans {{include the}} [...] "iron man" [...] game against Green Bay in 1932. In that game, Spartan coach Potsy Clark {{refused to make}} even a single substitution against the defending NFL champion Packers. Portsmouth won 19-0 and used only 11 players all game. At {{the end of the}} 1932 season, the Spartans were tied for first place in the league with the Chicago Bears. [...] That prompted what in retrospect became known as the first NFL playoff game. Blizzard conditions in Chicago meant the game was moved from <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> outdoor field to the indoor field at Chicago Stadium, which allowed for only an 80-yard field. The game was won 9-0 by the Bears, on a touchdown pass from Bronko Nagurski to Red Grange. [...] The resulting interest led to the establishment of Eastern and Western conferences and a regular championship game beginning in 1933.|$|R
5|$|On July 25, 2015, in {{what would}} be his final start for the Phillies before being traded, Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5–0 at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> {{striking}} out 13 and only giving up two walks, both to Dexter Fowler and besting the Cubs' Jake Arrieta—himself a no-hit pitcher a month later, on August 30 of that season. It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972. Hamels also joined Vida Blue, Mike Witt, Kent Mercker and Kevin Millwood as no-hit pitchers who also pitched in a combined no-hitter.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 National League wild-card tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1998 regular season, played between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants {{to determine the}} winner of the National League (NL) wild card. The game took place at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> in Chicago, on September 28, 1998. The Cubs won the game 5–3, holding the Giants scoreless {{for the majority of the}} game until the Giants threatened heavily in the ninth inning and scored all three of their runs. As a result of the game, the Cubs qualified for the postseason and the Giants did not.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{acquired}} University of Michigan All-American quarterback Harry Newman {{and versatile}} free agent halfback Ken Strong before the 1933 season. New York finished 11–3, {{first in the}} new Eastern Division. Newman led the NFL in passes completed (53), passing yards (973), touchdown passes (11), and longest pass completion (78 yards), with his passing yardage total setting an NFL record. New York's resurgence was led {{by some of the}} league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, and Hein. They advanced to play in the league's first official championship game in Chicago's <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> versus the Bears, where they lost 23–21 in a game which had six lead changes.|$|E
50|$|Selma {{was given}} the start for the Padres on {{opening day of the}} 1969 season. On April 8, 1969, Selma pitched a {{complete}} game and threw 12 strikeouts en route to a 2-1 victory, the Padres' first in franchise history. Selma ended up pitching only four games for the Padres, as they traded him to the Chicago Cubs on April 25, 1969 for Joe Niekro, Gary Ross, and Frankie Libran. It was during his time with the Cubs that Selma became known as a cheerleader for those sitting in <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> bleachers. He finished his tenure with the Cubs with a 10-8 record, 161 strikeouts, and a 3.63 ERA. However, he had a 7-1 record before finishing 10-8, and partially {{as a result of this}} skid was traded. Selma was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on November 17, 1969 with Oscar Gamble for a player to be named later (who became Larry Colton) and Johnny Callison.|$|R
5000|$|A time-honored {{and perhaps}} {{apocryphal}} story about Nagurski is a scoring gallop {{that he made}} against the Washington Redskins, knocking two linebackers in opposite directions, stomping a defensive back and crushing a safety, then bouncing off the goalposts and cracking <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> brick wall. On returning to the huddle for the extra point try, he reportedly said: [...] "That last guy hit me awfully hard."Once {{in a game against}} the Packers, the Bears prepared to punt, and Green Bay's Cal Hubbard went to Red Grange and said: [...] "I promise not to try to block the kick, Red, but {{get out of the way}} so I can get a shot at that Polack." [...] "Grange, glad not to try to block Hubbard for once, obliged. Cal tore through the line, slammed into Nagurski and bounced off. Rising slowly, he turned to Grange and said: [...] "Hey, Red, don't do me any more favors." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{finished}} July with 5-1 record, {{which was}} {{the best in the}} league. He became the first pitcher to win fourteen games in 2007, and won the [...] "National League Pitcher of the Month" [...] in July. After winning the award, Zambrano began to struggle throughout August. He started the month by earning a no decision on August 3, after leaving the game early due to dehydration. He recorded his one thousandth strike-out during his subsequent start, but proceeded to lose the game. Zambrano went winless in August, despite signing a rich multi-year contract with the Cubs. He started September by failing to win a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zambrano, who only lasted four innings, was booed by <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field's</b> audience as he left the field. In a post game interview, he retaliated at fans by stating, [...] "I thought these were the greatest fans in baseball, but they showed me today that they only care about themselves. That's not fair, when you are struggling, you want to feel like you have their support. I don't accept their reaction". He apologized for making the remarks the following day.|$|R
5|$|<b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball into the left field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, the TV cameras show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game with the guy behind the counter.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the current}} {{lack of an}} Olympic stadium, Chicago has dozens of {{existing}} sport venues: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, and Toyota Park in Bridgeview. Venues at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, among others, were also available and had been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities. Northerly Island and the lakefront along Lake Michigan would have hosted all beach and water events. The McCormick Place convention center, the second largest in the world, was the planned venue for indoor events like judo and weightlifting, as well as hosting all press offices, while Archery and the medals podium were slated for Grant Park.|$|E
5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part {{of some of the most}} memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field,</b> became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5000|$|According to an {{obituary}} in the New York Times (November 23, 1936, page 21, column 1): [...] "For {{nearly half}} a century, {{he was one of}} the great builders of Chicago." [...] Among the buildings that Graham planned or contributed to in Chicago were the Merchandise Mart, Field Building (now the La Salle Bank Building), <b>Wrigley</b> Building, <b>Field</b> Museum of Natural History reconstruction, Shedd Aquarium, Continental Illinois Bank Building, Union Station (Chicago), Marshall Field & Company Stores, the old Chicago Main Post Office Building, Pittsfield Building, State Bank of Chicago Building, and the Civic Opera House.|$|R
5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field</b> and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{returned}} to the Giants in 1963 and, at age 37, supplanted his single-season passing touchdowns record by throwing 36. He broke the record in the final game with three touchdowns against the Steelers, three days after being named NFL MVP by the AP. The Giants {{led the league in}} scoring by a wide margin, and {{for the third time in}} as many years clinched the Eastern Conference title. The Western champions were George Halas' Chicago Bears. The teams met in the 1963 NFL Championship Game at <b>Wrigley</b> <b>Field.</b> In the second quarter, Tittle injured his knee on a tackle by Larry Morris, and required a novocaine shot at halftime to continue playing. After holding a 10–7 halftime lead, The Giants were shutout in the second half, during which Tittle threw four interceptions. Playing through the knee injury, he completed 11 of 29 passes in the game for 147 yards, a touchdown, and five interceptions as the Bears won 14–10.|$|E
