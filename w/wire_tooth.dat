5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend <b>wire</b> into <b>teeth</b> and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the <b>wire</b> <b>teeth</b> were inserted. His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|R
5000|$|After {{greasy wool}} had been sorted and classed it was scoured.

Carbonizing was necessary when burr, seeds or any other vegetable matter was of such a nature {{that it could not}} be eliminated by carding, combing and subsequent processes. Carding was where fine <b>wire</b> <b>teeth</b> removed foreign matter, smooth and straighten out the fibres. The mesh was then condensed into a soft rope form known as a silver. Backwashing and gilling occurred to straighten out the fibre and sometimes oil was added as a substitute for the lost natural grease. Finally, combing straightened the long fibres and removed all the short and imperfect fibres. The rejected wool collected was known as the Noil. A ball of continuous length known as a ‘top’ was the result which was ready for packing.|$|R

50|$|In dentistry, the {{material}} is used in orthodontics for brackets and <b>wires</b> connecting the <b>teeth.</b> Once the SMA wire {{is placed in the}} mouth its temperature rises to ambient body temperature. This causes the nitinol to contract back to its original shape, applying a constant force to move the <b>teeth.</b> These SMA <b>wires</b> {{do not need to be}} retightened as often as other wires because they can contract as the teeth move unlike conventional stainless steel wires. Additionally, nitinol can be used in endodontics, where nitinol files are used to clean and shape the root canals during the root canal procedure. Because of the high fatigue tolerance and flexibility of nitinol, it greatly decreases the possibility of an endodontic file breaking inside the tooth during root canal treatment, thus improving safety for the patient.|$|R

30|$|The wire can be ligated to the bracket {{by means}} of metal {{ligature}} (ML) of different diameters, elastomeric ligature (EL), or by the specific closure system {{in the case of}} self-ligating brackets (SLB) [13]. Among the EL, the most common way to tie is the “ring” shape. Another tying option with elastomeric ligatures is the “figure 8 ” shape, which promotes greater pressure of the wire in the slot, increasing friction [14 – 17]. EL properties include light continuous force, consistent long-lasting seating archwire, resistance to water sorption, and shape memory [13]. Furthermore, they can be applied quickly, are comfortable for the patient, and have a variety of colors. However, the EL allows greater microbial accumulation {{on the surface of the}} teeth adjacent to the bracket, compared to the other ligation types, besides the fact that the archwires may not completely seat during torquing or rotational corrections, and binding may occur with sliding mechanics [13, 18 – 20]. Few studies have evaluated the influence of the ligation type in the force exerted by the <b>wire</b> on the <b>tooth</b> [6, 11, 12].|$|R
40|$|The nearly equiatomic nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy {{is known}} for its shape memory {{properties}}. These properties can be put to excellent use in various biomedical applications, such as <b>wires</b> for orthodontic <b>tooth</b> alignment and osteosynthesis staples. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the short-term biological safety of the NiTi alloy. We carried out an end-point dilution minimal essential medium (MEM) extract cytotoxicity test, a guinea-pig sensitization test and two genotoxicity tests: the Salmonella reverse mutation test and the chromosomal aberration test. The NiTi alloy showed no cytotoxic, allergic or genotoxic activity, similar to the clinical reference control material AISI 316 LVM stainless steel. This promising biological behaviour was most likely due to a minimal release of ions and in that way a reflection of the good corrosion resistance of the NiTi alloy. Given these very good results, together with the good tissue compatibility as shown in several implantation studies in the literature, the NiTi alloy can be regarded as a biologically safe implant material with many promising clinical applications.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the relative influence of the material of the orthodontic appliance (adhesive, bracket, ligature, and <b>wire)</b> on <b>tooth</b> displacements and developed stresses/strains after torque application. Methods A three-dimensional upper right central incisor with its periodontal ligament (PDL) and alveolus was modeled. A 0. 018 -in. slot discovery® (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany) bracket with a rectangular 0. 018  x  0. 025 -in. wire was generated. The orthodontic appliance varied in the material of its components: adhesive (composite resin or resin-modified glass ionomer cement), bracket (titanium, steel, or ceramic), wire (beta-titanium or steel), and ligature (elastomeric or steel). A total of 24 models were generated, and a palatal root torque of 5 ° was applied. Afterwards, crown and apex displacement, strains in the PDL, and stresses in the bracket were calculated and analyzed. Results The labial crown displacement and the palatal root displacement of the tooth were mainly influenced by the material of the wire (up to 150 % variation), followed by the material of the bracket (up to 19 % variation). The magnitude of strains developed in the PDL was primarily influenced by the material of the wire (up to 127 % variation), followed by the material of the bracket (up to 30 % variation) and the ligature (up to 13 % variation). Finally, stresses developed at the bracket were mainly influenced by the material of the wire (up to 118 % variation) and the bracket (up to 59 % variation). Conclusions The material properties of the orthodontic appliance and all its components should be considered during torque application.

A Titanium-niobium-aluminum (Ti- 24 Nb- 3 Al) SMAwire, which was considered to be biocompatible because it contained no nickel, was newly developed and mechanical property of this new alloy was improved by severe cold rolling reduction. Twenty-one male Wistar-strain rats (age; 6 weeks) were used in the animal experiment. A Ti-Nb-Al alloy wire and an orthodontic superelastic wire (Ni-Ti alloy wire) were set in the oral cavities of rats, and orthodontic palatal movement of maxillary first molars was performed with an initial load of 15 gf. The amount of tooth movement was measured and periodontal structures were histologically examined. The Ti-Nb-Al alloy wire was effective for palatal tooth movement without any adverse reaction in rats. There was no significant difference in the amount of tooth movement between the Ti-Nb-Al group and the Ni-Ti group. Histological observation of the periodontal tissues revealed no differences between the two groups. These results indicate that Ti-Nb-Al alloy wire has excellent mechanical properties suitable for orthodontic tooth movement, suggesting that Ti-Nb-Al wire may be used as a practical nickel-free shape memory and superelastic alloy wire for orthodontic treatment as a substitute for Ni-Ti alloy wire.

40|$|Purpose: In {{orthodontic}} treatments, wires {{of different}} metallic alloys {{are used for}} alignment, leveling, correction of the molar position, space closing, finish and retention. The purpose of {{the paper is the}} characteristics of austenitic stainless steel wires, with a square traverse section, which were produced using a rolling mill built for this purpose, are presented hereDesign/methodology/approach: With respect to finish and retention, these wires are responsible for adequate positioning of the upper teeth on the lower <b>teeth.</b> <b>Wires</b> that are subjected to incisor torque require high resistance and stiffness. For this, wires of rectangular austenitic stainless steel are used due to high modulus of elasticity and good corrosion resistance in the oral environment. Because of the rectangular geometry, wire production requires process development suitable for industrial scale manufacture with geometric characteristics and mechanical properties better adapted to the use conditions. Findings: To obtain wires with such characteristics, a rolling mill was developed for the production of rectangular wires by a rolling process with the objective of reducing cost of the cold drawing process that is currently used which utilize complex and expensive wire-drawing dies. In addition to the rolling process itself, wire deformation, microhardness, tension and bend tests were also performed. Research limitations/implications: A rolling-mill was built that successfully produced dental wires within acceptable tolerances and physical/mechanical properties. These wires exhibited excellent hardness and tensile strength, although slightly less than analogous commercial wires. It is expected that this problem are corrected by using initial wires with a higher hardness, since this property is directly related with the tensile strength.

50|$|In {{combination}} {{with a series}} connection, T-segments are often produced as a phase compound {{in the form of}} a toothed chain. As is the case of single T-segments, the linear-winding technique as well as the flyer-winding technique are also applied in this context. When it comes to the winding of the <b>teeth,</b> the final <b>wire</b> of the first tooth is guided to the next tooth and then serves as the starting wire for the second tooth. This process continues, depending on the number of a phase's sub-segments. The design of the components does not show any substantial difference compared to the one of classic single teeth. The main reason for the processing of T-segments into one tooth chain lies in the reduced of number of contact points. Six contact points are required for three wound single tooth poles. However, only two contact points are needed if the just mentioned arrangement inside the winding machine is adopted. When using high current with low operating power, this type of manufacture is especially beneficial since it reduces contact resistances and potential errors. However, it is a very complex endeavor to form the tooth chains to a complete stator which is of disadvantage. It must be ensured, for example, that the end <b>wires</b> of each <b>tooth</b> are equipped with tension relief to ensure that the winding does not open during handling. Usually, it is taken care of with adhesive tape or pole or bag-type forming of the tooth's frontal insulation where the wire may be attached after the winding process. Single teeth are easy to handle, whereas tooth chains must be built in carefully, taking into account the risk of damaging the connecting wires.|$|R

Until recently, the extraction of the affected primary anterior teeth was the common treatment option for ECC, which results in unattractive appearance and could interfere with the personality and behavioral development of the child. Moreover, the early loss of primary anterior teeth results in reduced masticatory efficiency, loss of vertical dimension, development of parafunctional habits including tongue thrusting, speech problems, malocclusion and space loss.

Inadequate esthetic options in addition to the severity of the condition have prompted extraction in most of the cases, in spite of the treatment being not convincing both to the parents as well as the clinicians. In cases where teeth are severely decayed, endodontic treatment and placement of some retentive features is necessary before crown reconstruction. Some authors suggest using anterior stainless steel crowns with or without labial facing for full crown coverage of incisors that have lost an appreciable amount of their tooth structure, whereas some describe the resin post and core provided with orthodontic <b>wire.</b> Anterior primary <b>teeth,</b> when grossly decayed, lack a coronal structure, leading to decreased support and adhesion for a composite crown. Hence, use of a resin-based composite reinforced with polyethylene fibers is preferred and the technique is referred to as the 'short post technique' which requires root canal treatment and a short composite post. One of the most important considerations in reconstruction of primary teeth is the physiologic root resorption. Therefore, in most cases, the dentist should consider almost 3 - 4 mm of the existing root for obtaining enough retention and resistance of the severely damaged tooth restoration.

30|$|Fiber-reinforced {{composites}} {{were recently}} introduced into dentistry and soon {{found their way}} into orthodontics as fixed retainers. Fibers were added to composites on the premise of providing more rigidity to the composites [42]. This advantage can also serve as a disadvantage in orthodontics where it might limit physiologic tooth movement and therefore compromise the health of periodontium. It is claimed that multistranded <b>wires</b> allow physiologic <b>tooth</b> movement to occur which is also required for reorganization of PDL fibers [21],[43]. During the first 3 to 4 months after the completion of orthodontic treatment, full-time retention is mandatory to prevent relapse while the PDL fiber reorganization occurs [43]. It has also been well documented that PDL widens remarkably during the orthodontic treatment [37]; therefore, it seems logical that if a certain type of retainer is to provide physiologic tooth movement, after 6  months of follow-up, PDL should have regained its normal width. Based on this hypothesis, a positive value was assigned to the periapical radiographs in which the width of the PDL was decreased after the 6 -month follow-up, indicating the normal reorganization process of PDL fibers; otherwise, a negative value was assigned to the periapical radiograph. For this purpose, periapical radiographs were obtained from each individual, both at the baseline and after the 6 -month follow-up. Even though there has been some criticism over the reliability of assessing the width of periodontal ligament via the periapical radiographs [15], periapical radiographs have long been considered as the standard screening method. Based on this agreement, it was observed that in the maxillary arch, for 60 % of the individuals in the fiber-reinforced group, a negative value was registered. This reported percentage for the spiral wire group was 35 %. The {{difference between the two groups}} was not statistically significant. This can be attributed to the number of the individuals examined in this study. These results reveal that in more than half of the patients in the fiber-reinforced group, PDL had not regained its normal width following the completion of orthodontic treatment. The recorded percentage in the fiber-reinforced group was almost the same for mandibular arch, but in the spiral wire group, it was increased to 50 %. It can be presumed that the presence of fixed retainer does not permit full reorganization of PDL fibers after 6  months of follow-up. To our knowledge, none of the previous studies have evaluated the changes in the PDL width following insertion of fixed orthodontic retainers. However, Pandis et al. reported no change in the bone level following the placement of lingual fixed retainers, even though probing depth was increased [15]. However, in their study, all the retainers were fabricated by 0.195 -in. braided wire. Furthermore, the changes in the PDL are reported to occur at an earlier stage of periodontal disease than the changes in alveolar crest [44] and thus need to be taken into account more readily.|$|R
