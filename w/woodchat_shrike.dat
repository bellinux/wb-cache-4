5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} in {{association}} with a <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> perches {{near the top of}} a tree, ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the scrub robin perches on a bush or lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, ocellated lizards and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed scrub robin can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The diet {{composition}} and hunting success of migrating <b>Woodchat</b> <b>Shrikes</b> (Lanius senator) observed during spring in SE coastal Romania is presented. Visual observations were made during 24 - 30 April 1997. The number of birds present ranged from 1 to 4. Altogether 71 hunting attempts were observed and 76 % {{of them were}} successful. From successful hunting attempts, a total of 22 prey animals were identified, all were Tiger Beetles (Cicindella lunulata), which have bright metallic colour and are easily identifiable in sunshine. No impaling was observed. The pellets contained remains of 103 prey animals, mainly C. lunulata and Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa...|$|R
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} bird species are {{resident}} or passage migrants here, including many ducks, geese and waders. [...] The {{wide range of}} species is mainly due to Brandon Marsh {{being one of the}} few extensive areas of water in the area (accounting for such local rarities as osprey and whooper swan) together with the existence of habitats such as reedbed and woodland in close proximity. 148 different species were recorded during 2009 aloneincluding one new record, a vagrant <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> which was the first recorded in Warwickshireand 66 species bred at the site. These figures have been assisted by a nest box scheme; in 2008 there were 49 occupied nest boxes which produced 270 fledged young, and by 2009 these numbers had increased to 65 and 352 respectively, including two owl species, barn owl and tawny owl.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>woodchat</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius senator) is {{a member}} of the shrike family Laniidae. The genus name, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for [...] "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as [...] "butcher birds" [...] because of their feeding habits. The {{specific}} senator is Latin for [...] "senator", so-named because its chestnut cap recalled the colour of the stripe on the toga of a Roman senator. The common name [...] "Woodchat" [...] is an Anglicisation of German waldkatze, literally [...] "woodcat", and [...] "shrike" [...] is from Old English scr√≠c, [...] "shriek", referring to the shrill call.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The size of shrike {{populations in}} Turkey is still unknown {{with respect to}} the European Threat Status. All {{breeding}} species of shrikes in Turkey- the Red-Backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), Lesser Grey Shrike (L. minor), <b>Woodchat</b> <b>Shrike</b> (L. senator), and Masked Shrike (L. nubicus) - are subject to habitat loss in their European distribution.

40|$|A {{study on}} the Sicilian {{avifauna}} changes and its existing connections with the land use variations {{has been carried out}} from the 80 s till today. We compared the Sicilian ornithological data acquired from the atlas maps with the regional land use maps data. We examined the land use variations and the distribution changes of some bird species on a regional level. To this aim, we analyzed the spatial distribution data of the birds in the period from 1984 - 1992 and 1993 - 2006. Moreover we examined the land use data of the period going from 1987 - 1988 and 1993 - 2000. After a preliminary analysis, we selected target species linked to different environments. Forest: Great spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Eurasian Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Marsh Tit Poecile palustris siculus; scrub and bush: Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, arable and grazing land: Greater short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra; complex systems, olive grove and almond trees: European Roller Coracias garrulus, <b>Woodchat</b> <b>Shrike</b> Lanius senator. The distribution changes of these species in the examined periods were significant and they were not linked to the demography of the species nor to the major or minor level of exploration of the island. According to the results, it is obvious that, for these species, there is a clear connection between the land use changes and the distribution variations. Other species manifested changes that seemed to be linked to demographic trends, which involved the distribution of these species (for example the diffusion of the Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus). None of the existing changes could be unequivocally related to climate change...|$|E
