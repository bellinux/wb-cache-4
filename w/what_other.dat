5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field.

The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E

On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.

Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to <b>what</b> <b>other</b> patients of the hospice unit receive.

5|$|The 3D version opened Friday, August 25, 2017, across 371 theaters (or 463 3D auditoriums), earning $552,773 in {{its opening}} weekend, {{averaging}} $1,490 per screen; this {{was considered an}} amount lower than <b>what</b> <b>other</b> '80's and '90's re-releases earned in their respective opening weekends such as Top Gun ($1.9 million, which also played in IMAX), Raiders of the Lost Ark ($1.6 million), {{as well as more}} high-profile reissues of Titanic, The Lion King and Jurassic Park over the last several years. During its opening weekend, Titanic 3D grossed $17.3 million in 2,674 theaters, averaging $6,464 in April 2012. While not major contributing factors, the release performance of the film is thought to have suffered from coinciding with Hurricane Harvey, which eased moviegoing admissions {{in many parts of the}} country, the much anticipated boxing fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor, the season 7 finale of Game of Thrones, and by Cameron's decision to release his original 1991 theatrical cut instead of the widely popular extended edition, and his controversial comments regarding the Wonder Woman film.|$|E
5|$|The race saw the {{competitive}} début of Pirelli's new ultrasoft tyre compound, which was provided alongside the supersoft and soft compounds. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs {{to set aside}} one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The drivers have freedom of <b>what</b> <b>other</b> compounds they choose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets. From this race onwards, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile allowed drivers to choose alternative helmet designs for one race weekend per season, a practice usually prohibited as they have to wear the same design to make them more recognisable to spectators and television audiences. As a consequence, Felipe Massa's helmet featured extensive artwork by graffiti artist Os Gêmeos, teammate Valtteri Bottas featured casino-inspired imagery and Haas driver Romain Grosjean sported a tribute to the late Jules Bianchi on his helmet. The race marked a reason for celebration at McLaren, as the team had started their first ever Grand Prix at Monaco fifty years earlier.|$|E
