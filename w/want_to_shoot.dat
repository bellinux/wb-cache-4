25|$|In {{the heat}} of the moment you {{sometimes}} do an act without thinking. I think this is what happened with Hodson. He had no need to interfere. He was stupid. He was told to keep away. He grabbed Pete (i.e.Peter Walker) and hit him with an iron bar. He caused his own death. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> him. I could have shot a lot more.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to film Spender's final scene in [...] "One Son", actor William B. Davis became upset, saying that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> Owens and adding that he enjoyed working with the actor. On the other hand, Davis had no trouble with {{slapping}} Owens, in a scene of [...] "Two Fathers" [...] in which Spender is twice hit by the Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
500|$|... "It was {{important}} to Jarrett that we didn't glorify this event," [...] said Salerno. [...] "He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> any of the scenes with John Lennon at The Dakota {{out of respect for}} the residents that were there at the time John was killed, so all of that footage was shot separately at another location that we were able keep closed and controlled." [...] These scenes were shot at the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn.|$|E

500|$|Digital Domain {{handled the}} bulk of the film's 200+ effects shots, {{including}} pools of blood and bloody fingerprints found at crime scenes. [...] For the murder of Cecelia Shepard that took place at Lake Berryessa, blood seepage and clothing stains were added in post-production. Fincher did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> the blood with practical effects because wiping everything down after every take would take too long so the murder sequences were done with CG blood.|$|E
500|$|Also, {{unlike many}} other {{characters}} of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. Somerhalder did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with co-creator/executive producer J.J. Abrams. The character was generally well received by critics and fans; USA Today described Boone as a [...] "callow, privileged young man striving for maturity." [...] Boone dies from his injuries after being crushed inside a falling plane.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} spent $4 {{million to}} restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized {{a variety of}} film stocks. Richardson said, [...] "It depends whether you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different." [...] For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras {{at the same time}} in different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, [...] "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch." [...] This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{characters}} of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, [...] "Five." [...] In the script for the pilot, the writers ran a search and replace to change Boone's name so when Jack counted to five, the script read, [...] "One, two, three, four, Boone." [...] Somerhalder did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with co-creator/executive producer J.J. Abrams. [...] Somerhalder was paid between $20,000 and $40,000 an episode, initially received the third highest billing in the credits, before the producers decided to list the main cast alphabetically.|$|E
500|$|Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{gave the}} film a mixed review in The Guardian: [...] "The Girl {{is perhaps a}} more {{effective}} piece of film-making than Hitchcock, though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the directorhe film depicts [...] accurately, though Jones's Hitchcock {{appears to be more}} gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was". Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] was terribly upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan Hunter said, [...] "e wanted to shoot it, but something in him didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> it, and everybody could hear how nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E
500|$|In the Comines {{sector of}} the front there was an early fraternization between German and French {{soldiers}} in December 1914, during a short truce, and {{there are at least}} two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviors in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. [...] Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted [...] "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." [...] When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot....</b> They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn’t have any differences with the French but with the English.’ ...|$|E

500|$|... "One Son" [...] {{would be}} the last episode of the series to feature Owens' character, Jeffrey Spender, until the ninth season entry [...] "William". Owens first learned that he would be killed off when Carter called him and told him, [...] "You're going to go out a hero, of sorts". Owens was {{slightly}} disappointed, noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season. Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series, and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> you! I enjoy working with you!" [...] Owens, however, jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it. In the episode, Laurie Holden, who played Marita Covarrubias, returns. Spotnitz crafted the sequence in which she confronts Mulder to be a way of [...] "taking away [...] beauty and making her [...] as horrifying as possible". To accomplish this, she was given [...] "terrible-looking" [...] contact lenses and her hair was unkempt.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. When talking to 'MTV News' about the video Minaj stated, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> the typical new-artist vision. Thank God I have a wonderful label that stands behind me and my vision. I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. I told him the idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play dress-up. They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make it pretty in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{producers}} were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau {{was in the}} area. The producers called it a [...] "natural move" [...] to have him audition. Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it. A lot of children were seen {{for the role of}} Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after {{the producers}} were impressed with his role in Antwone Fisher. [...] Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on Alias, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character. The producers were looking for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. [...] A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be an antipathetic character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, [...] "Five". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.|$|E

2500|$|Vang {{fled the}} scene on foot and {{discarded}} his remaining ammunition, later stating {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> anyone else. [...] Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give Vang a ride, eventually taking him to Vang's cabin. [...] Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting. [...] An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail. [...] His bail was set at $2.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> you? Could I not have done it half an hour ago if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "They clearly wanted out!" [...] judged Farrelly. [...] "But we wouldn't let them. The {{strategy}} was simple: 'Wait for them. Shoot when they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot.</b> Guilt them to death.' It didn't work on everyone." [...] Colin Farrell initially {{agreed to be}} in the Butler leprechaun sketch—as Butler's brother, also a leprechaun—but then he backed out and Gerard Butler did the sketch by himself. Farrelly said that when he approached George Clooney about playing himself in a sketch (the gag was that Clooney is bad at picking up women), Clooney told him [...] "No fucking way". There were two sketches cut from the film that were originally shown during a test screening; one that starred Anton Yelchin as a necrophiliac mortician who worked at a hospital and had sex with the dead female bodies, and another starring Julianne Moore and Tony Shalhoub as a married couple being interviewed by a detective about their missing daughter. Producer Penotti said that the sketches would be seen on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the film, however only the latter was included in the release.|$|E
2500|$|More {{details were}} {{released}} in the days preceding the finale. Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' anger….He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does he know that he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NBA {{decided to}} address this {{undesirable}} situation by instituting a new rule regarding off-the-ball fouls—that is, committing a personal foul against an offensive player who neither has the ball nor is {{making an effort to}} obtain it. [...] The new rule stated that if the defensive team commits an off-the-ball foul within the last two minutes of the game, the offensive team would be allowed to keep possession of the ball after the awarding of either one or two free throws. [...] Since the entire reason for employing intentional fouling as a strategy was to quickly terminate the offensive team's possession, this new rule, when in effect, forced the team using intentional fouling to foul only the offensive player who had the ball. [...] This brought an end to the need for Chamberlain (or any other poor free throw shooter) to play hide and seek with opposing defenders in intentional fouling situations. [...] The current version of the rule carries an even more punitive penalty for a violation—not only does the victimized team maintain possession but it is permitted to select any player they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> the awarded free throw, obviously choosing the most proficient free throw shooter on their squad.|$|E
