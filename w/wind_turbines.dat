The Output power can be adjusted by controlling the generator speed and pitch angle of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> When the <b>wind</b> speed below the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rated, the output power of generator can be maximized by controlling the generator speed at point of maximum power coefficient.

In this condition, the output power of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> needs to be regulated {{to conform to the}} generator power rate.

The increased <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade size has led to increased interest in the accurate prediction of the aerodynamics of large <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blades. In this work, two-dimensional simulations of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> airfoils and three-dimensional simulations of the Sandia 100 m <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blade were conducted.
