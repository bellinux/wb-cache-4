Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E

The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been cut and 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been cut in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been cut and 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been cut <b>have</b> the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> been cut is more than 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been cut both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water <b>which</b> <b>has</b> little oil...|$|R

5|$|A small naval squadron, {{consisting}} of HMS Aeolus, HMS Cleopatra and the brig HMS Recruit, advanced into Fort-de-France Bay on 5 February. This advance spread panic among the French militia defending {{the bay and}} Amphitrite and the other shipping anchored there were set on fire and destroyed, while the forts {{in the southern part}} of the island were abandoned. On 8 February, Maitland's force, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet fired a shot, arrived on the western side of Fort Desaix and laid siege to it. Minor detachments spread across the remainder of the island: Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Barnes captured Saint-Pierre and another force occupied Fort-de-France and seized the corvette Diligente in the harbour. By 10 February, when Prevost's force linked up with Maitland's, Fort Desaix was the only remaining point of resistance.|$|E

The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E

The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909.

The cars <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet caught fire were detached from those burning, {{and by the time}} the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned.

After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> occurred prior to dissolution.
