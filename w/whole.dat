Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label <b>whole</b> objects first, and parts of properties of objects later in development.|$|E

Information flows bidirectionally between smaller and larger systems as well as rhizomatic contagion. When this bidirectionality of information flow and understanding of role is compromised, for whatever reason, the system begins to break down: <b>wholes</b> no longer recognize their dependence on their subsidiary parts, and parts no longer recognize the organizing authority of the <b>wholes.</b> Cancer may be understood as such a breakdown in the biological realm.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small <b>whole</b> numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small <b>whole</b> numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in <b>whole</b> number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E

40|$|My {{aim is to}} {{understand}} the practice of mathematics {{in a way that}} sheds light on {{the fact that it is}} at once a priori and capable of extending our knowledge. The account that is sketched draws first on the idea, derived from Kant, that a calculation or demonstration can yield new knowledge in virtue of the fact that the system of signs it employs involves primitive parts (e. g., the ten digits of arithmetic or the points, lines, angles, and areas of Euclidean geometry) that combine into <b>wholes</b> (numerals or drawn Euclidean figures) that are themselves parts of larger <b>wholes</b> (the array of written numerals in a calculation or the diagram of a Euclidean demonstration). Because <b>wholes</b> such as numerals and Euclidean figures both have parts and are parts of larger <b>wholes,</b> their parts can be recombined into new <b>wholes</b> in ways that enable extensions of our knowledge. I show that sentences of Frege’s Begriffsschrift can also be read as involving three such levels of articulation; because they have these three levels, we can understand in essentially the same way how a proof from concepts alone can extend our knowledge. Mathematics, the most venerable of the exact sciences, is also the most puzzling. How are we {{to understand}} a discipline that is, as mathematics seems to be, at once...|$|R
