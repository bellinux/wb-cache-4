He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost deposit. He explained that he was standing because [...] "if we don't face this now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren what we were doing when the global fascist state was installed.

The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiasco, {{along with}} rappers Common, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, has been {{credited}} as {{a pioneer of}} the conscious hip hop movement, which focuses on social issues. [...] Subjects touched upon on Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor include absent parents, terrorism, Islam and religion, war, and prostitution. [...] Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as [...] "very intellectual" [...] and his father as a [...] "Renaissance man". [...] He rejects the misogyny common in hip hop, which he discusses in the song [...] "Hurt Me Soul". [...] Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to censorship in music: [...] "If we're going to [...] that are offensive, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to blind and deafen everyone.

500|$|In October 2008, while {{commenting on}} defense {{programs}} {{likely to be}} cut following the change in government, John Young, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, stated that the VH-71 [...] "is very high on that list". The rising cost of VH-71 program contrasted poorly with President Barack Obama's stance on curbing government spending; during a White House gathering in February 2009 President Obama commented that the procurement process had [...] "gone amok and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to fix it." [...] He additionally stated that [...] "The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me." [...] In March 2009 the projected total cost for the planned 28 VH-71s was over $13billion. [...] On 6 April 2009 the proposed Defense budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates had not included funding for the VH-71. [...] On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Navy announced that the contract was officially canceled, and that remaining funds were to be reinvested in upgrades to the existing fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters. [...] Nine VH-71s had been completed at time of the cancellation.|$|E

2500|$|In April, Portadown loyalists {{threatened}} to picket St John's Catholic Church {{at the top}} of Garvaghy Road. On 29 May a [...] "junior" [...] Orange march passed near Garvaghy Road. There were clashes following the march with 13 police officers and four civilians hurt. The police fired 50 plastic bullets during the clashes. That month, DUP politician and Orangeman Paul Berry said Orangemen would not be stopped from marching the Garvaghy Road: [...] "If {{it is a matter of}} taking the law into our own hands then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to do it.

In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.|$|E

2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Elizabeth's {{personality}} and views has been compiled from impressions and descriptions by those she has met. Canadian politician Michael Ignatieff remarked in 2010, after a private audience with the Queen, how he was struck by her [...] "wonderful sense of the absurd" [...] and noted her [...] "sense of humour, that sense of the absurd, that sense of comedy of life has survived 60 years of gruelling public life." [...] After a weekend at Balmoral Castle hosted by the Queen, Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean recounted witnessing a relaxed, informal home life: Elizabeth and her family preparing a meal together—including a salad dressing devised by the Queen—and doing the washing up afterwards. Lady Pamela Hicks, a cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, commented on Elizabeth's personality as [...] "individualistic". Hicks' mother remembers back to when George VI died. Elizabeth was in Kenya with her husband when she found out, [...] "I’m so sorry, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to go back to England," [...] she recalled Elizabeth saying.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying for and what the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, {{the first}} Norwegian NH90 {{helicopter}} was delivered. In July 2012, the Norwegian Deputy Defence Minister Roger Ingebrigtsen announced that [...] "once our current Westland Lynx helicopters reach their {{end of life}} in 2014, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> replacement helicopters on our naval vessels. If the NH90 hasn’t been delivered, we will purchase another helicopter...considering that the aircraft were to be delivered by 2005, and that delivery is yet to start by 2012, our confidence in the producer isn't exactly on the rise" [...] In August 2012 {{it was reported that}} the Royal Norwegian Air Force would be recommending that the Department of Defence contact Sikorsky to verify whether versions of the H-60 Seahawk, specifically the MH-60R, would be a viable alternative to the NH-90 in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role. Defence Minister Espen Barth Eide stated [...] "We still believe the marine version of the NH90 to be the optimal platform, and we hope to purchase it, but there are limits to our patience." [...] By January 2013, Norway had ordered a total of 14 NH90s. [...] In January 2016, six of the 14 aircraft had been delivered.|$|E

Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?"

2500|$|Balachander {{wanted the}} same artistes to reprise their roles on television. Unfortunately, Sivakumar was {{committed}} to a daily soap.

This is when Y. Gee. Mahendra, a well-known theater and film personality was selected to play JKB. [...] "It is a challenge for a comedy artist like me to do a character role like JKB. I am enjoying both the challenge and the role," [...] he said. He, who has acted in more than 300 films, said {{it is a kind of}} homecoming for him. [...] "I acted in a Balachander film 26 years ago!". He was not worried about the fact that JKB was once successfully portrayed by Sivakumar. [...] "Had it been done by Sivaji (Sivaji Ganesan), I would not have accepted the role. Only two people inspire me, and they are K. Balachander and Sivaji [...] When I have KB on the sets to guide me, why should I worry? I also have my other guru Sivaji in mind".|$|E
