On Apr 1, 1917, Wilson called for war, emphasizing that the U.S. had to fight to maintain its honor and to have a decisive voice in shaping the new postwar world.

Lafayette's hosts considered him a judge of how successful the experiment had been. According to cultural historian Lloyd Kramer, Lafayette (as well as a later visitor to America, Alexis de Tocqueville) [...] "provided foreign confirmations of the self-image that shaped America's national identity {{in the early nineteenth century}} and that has remained a dominant theme in the national ideology ever since: the belief that America's Founding Fathers, institutions, and freedom created the most democratic, egalitarian, and prosperous society in the world".|$|E
500|$|Bullion {{from the}} California Gold Rush and other discoveries {{came to the}} Eastern U.S. in {{considerable}} quantities beginning in 1848. [...] By the following year, {{the price of gold}} relative to silver had dropped, making it profitable to export American silver coins, sell them as bullion, and use the payment in gold to buy more U.S. coins. Silver coins consequently vanished from circulation, meaning the highest-value American coin actually circulating that was worth less than the quarter eagle ($2.50 piece) was the half-dollar-sized copper cent, which saw no use in much of the country because of its lack of legal tender status. Early in 1849, Congress authorized a gold dollar to help bridge the gap. [...] Spanish silver coins were the bulk of what was left in commerce for small change, although there was disagreement as to the value to be assigned to them. [...] Additionally, they were often heavily worn, reducing their intrinsic worth at a time <b>when</b> <b>Americans</b> expected coins to contain metal worth the value assigned to them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} between British English and American English terminology {{arose in the}} late 19th century <b>when</b> <b>Americans</b> adopted the term [...] "street railway", rather than [...] "tramway", with the vehicles being called [...] "streetcars" [...] rather than [...] "trams". Some {{have suggested that the}} Americans' preference for the term [...] "street railway" [...] at that time was influenced by German emigrants to the United States (who were more numerous than British immigrants in the industrialized Northeast), as it {{is the same as the}} German term for the mode, Straßenbahn (meaning [...] "street railway"). A further difference arose because, while Britain abandoned all of its trams except Blackpool after World War II, seven major North American cities (Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Newark, and New Orleans) continued to operate large streetcar systems. When these cities upgraded to new technology, they called it light rail to differentiate it from their existing streetcars since some continued to operate both the old and new systems. Since the 1980s, [...] Portland, Oregon, has built all three types of system: a high-capacity light rail system in dedicated lanes and rights-of-way, a low-capacity streetcar system integrated with street traffic, and an aerial tram system.|$|E

2500|$|After 1831, Mexican rancho {{owners would}} logically erect their {{dwellings}} on or very near creeks. Locally, Juan Prado’s adobe was near Adobe Creek & Juanita Briones’ adobe was near Barron Creek. Because they were permanent {{features of the}} landscape, creeks were often used as Rancho boundaries. This was true locally, where the Mexican diseño show Adobe Creek as the boundary between Rancho San Antonio and Rancho La Purisima Concepcion. <b>When</b> <b>Americans</b> took over in 1850, speculators bought much of this land. Much of it initially became large self-contained ranches---typically running cattle & growing crops like wheat, barley & oats that required little or no irrigation. That changed in a few decades when {{it was discovered that}} orchards and vineyards could thrive here. Such agriculture of course used more water. Local land was cut progressively [...] into smaller holdings, until most of it [...] was subdivided as the population increased. This meant more and more wells, including large ones dug along Adobe Creek by early water companies to serve the little town of Los Altos. The water table inevitably shrank as a result, and alarms about this development appeared, at least as early as the 1920s. In the early 1930s, the Los Altos News reported that the water table, which stood at 120 feet in 1898, was now down to 335 feet.|$|E

But, supposing that just fear quieted, you would feel what I and every one else can feel. It might be the sense of the majestic hands of Man upon the locks of the last doors of life; large and terrible hands, like those of that youth who poises the stone above Florence, and looks out upon the circle of the hills. It might be that huge heave of flank and chest and throat in [...] "The Slave," [...] which is like an earthquake lifting a whole landscape; it might be that tremendous Madonna, whose charity is more strong than death.

"Now, {{you know}} you're not serious," [...] said his wife; {{and though he}} would not admit this, {{he could not be}} seriously sorry for the new {{interest}} which she took in the affair. There was no longer any question of changing their state-room. Under the tonic influence of the excitement she did not go back to her berth after lunch, and she was up later after dinner than he could have advised. She was absorbed in Agatha, but in her liberation from her hypochondria, she began also to make a comparative study of the American swells, in the light of her late experience with the German highhotes. It is true that none of the swells gave her the opportunity of examining them at close range, as the highhotes had done. They kept to their state-rooms mostly, where, after he thought she could bear it, March told her how near he had come to making her their equal by an outlay of six hundred dollars. She now shuddered at the thought; but she contended that in their magnificent exclusiveness they could give points to European princes; and that this showed again how <b>when</b> <b>Americans</b> did try to do a thing, they beat the world. Agatha Triscoe knew who they were, but she did not know them; they belonged to another kind of set; she spoke of them as [...] "rich people," [...] and she seemed content to keep away from them with Mrs. March and with the shy, silent old wife of Major Eltwin, to whom March sometimes found her talking.|$|E
6000|$|An acute critic {{tells me}} that Americans reading such deprecatory words as these by an Englishman about his country's {{institutions}} would {{say that this is}} precisely an instance of what an American means by the Oxford manner. Americans whose attitude towards their own country is that of a lover to his lady or a child to its mother, cannot--he says--understand how Englishmen can be critical of their own country, and yet love her. Well, the Englishman's attitude to his country is that of a man to himself, and the way he runs her down is but a part of that special English bone-deep self-consciousness. Englishmen (the writer amongst them) love their country as much as the French love France and the Americans America; but she is {{so much a part of}} them that to speak well of her is like speaking well of themselves, which they have been brought up to regard as [...] "bad form." [...] <b>When</b> <b>Americans</b> hear Englishmen speaking critically of their own country, let them note it for a sign of complete identification with that country rather than of detachment from it. But on the whole it must be admitted that English universities have a broadening influence on the material which comes to them so set and narrow. They do a little to discover for their children that there are many points of view, and much which needs an open mind in this world. They have not precisely a democratic influence, but taken by themselves they would not be inimical to democracy. And when the war is over they will surely be still broader in philosophy and teaching. Heaven forbid that we should see vanish all that is old, and has, as it were, the virginia-creeper, the wistaria bloom of age upon it; there is a beauty in age and a health in tradition, ill dispensed with. What is hateful in age is its lack of understanding and of sympathy; in a word--its intolerance. Let us hope this wind of change may sweep out and sweeten the old places of our country, sweep away the cobwebs and the dust, our narrow ways of thought, our mannikinisms. But those who hate intolerance dare not be intolerant with the foibles of age; we should rather see them as comic, and gently laugh them out. I pretend to no proper knowledge of the American people; but, though amongst them there are doubtless pockets of fierce prejudice, I have on the whole the impression of a wide and tolerant spirit. To that spirit one would appeal when it comes to passing judgment on the educated Briton. He may be self-sufficient, but he has grit; and at bottom grit is what Americans appreciate more than anything. If the motto of the old Oxford college, [...] "Manners makyth man," [...] were true, one would often be sorry for the Briton. But his manners do not make him; they mar him. His goods are all absent from the shop window; he is not a man of the world in the wider meaning of that expression. And there is, of course, a particularly noxious type of travelling Briton, who does his best, unconsciously, to deflower his country wherever he goes. Selfish, coarse-fibred, loud-voiced--the sort which thanks God he is a Briton--I suppose because nobody else will do it for him.|$|E
