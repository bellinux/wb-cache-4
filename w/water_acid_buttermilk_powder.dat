40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of various dairy powders and milk constituents on the adhesion of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. Adhesion of a microorganism to a cell surface such as epithelial cells or tooth enamel is considered to be the first step in pathogenesis. Inhibiting this process may have therapeutic effects in vivo. The adherence assays were performed by incubating S. mutans with HA in the presence of each test material for 45 min, followed by centrifugal separation of the HA. Unbound bacteria were then quantified using a fluorescent dye. Sweet and <b>Acid</b> WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and cream powder were found to very effectively inhibit adherence of S. mutans to phosphate-buffered saline coated HA (PBS-HA). Sodium caseinate and the casein fractions a-,b- and j-casein were also found to show high levels of anti-adhesive activity. A selection of test materials were assessed using saliva-coated HA (S-HA), and similar trends were observed. The results suggest commercial dairy powders, and certain milk proteins, can inhibit adhesion of S. mutans to HA and may have potential to control dental caries...|$|R

40|$|Almost 16 % of milk {{produced}} in European Union is being converted to butter. Buttermilk, {{is a low}} cost by-product from butter manufacture and available in large quantities but has been considered invaluable for many years. When cream is churned to butter the stable oil in water emulsion is destabilized and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is disrupted which is released in buttermilk. Thus, {{over the last two}} decades it has gained considerable attention due to its specific composition (proteins and polar lipids) attributed towards the MFGM. In account to this composition of <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> it finds application in food industry as a natural stabilizing and emulsifying agent. It also finds application as a source of total solids and is commercially being added upto 10 % in many food products.

40|$|Dental caries is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease caused by colonisation of tooth surfaces by cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus salivarius. Reducing initial adherence of such bacteria to teeth may delay onset of caries. Many foods, such as milk, can inhibit microbial adherence. In this investigation, the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on adherence of S. sobrinus and S. salivarius to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel, was examined. Untreated (UT) acid whey protein concentrate (AWPC) 80 inhibited streptococcal adherence to phosphate-buffered saline-coated HA (PBS-HA) and saliva-coated HA (S-HA) by > 80 % at ⩾ 31. 25 μg mL− 1. UT sweet WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and cream powder also significantly reduced adherence (P < 0. 05). Enzyme-treatment of all dairy powders reduced their anti-adhesion activity.

40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk. The range of concentrated and spray-dried dairy powders commercially produced today is wide and includes ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated concentrated milks, in-can sterilised milks, skim milk powder, WMP, formulated infant food powders, high protein powders and high fat <b>powders,</b> whey <b>powders,</b> <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders,</b> cream powders, casein and caseinates.

While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised bottled milk sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed.

This study firstly compares the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on the adherence of S. mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. A fluorescence-based method was used to quantify adherence of S. mutans to HA both in the presence (S-HA) and absence (PBS-HA) of saliva. Secondly, binding of proteins present in the test materials to HA was quantified using bicinchonic acid assays and SDS-PAGE. In addition, the effect of UT and ET dairy powders on growth of S. mutans was examined using an optical-density based assay. UT acid whey protein concentrate (WPC) 80, sweet WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP) and cream powder (CP) significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited adhesion of S. mutans at ≥ 31. 25 μg mL− 1 in the presence and absence of saliva.

40|$|Practically {{all of the}} 85, 000 hogs on {{the farms}} of Utah (as of August 1, 1934) are in the {{irrigated}} sections of the state where they fit in well with dairying. Utah, however, is a hog-deficient area and produces about 109, 000 hogs less than are slaughtered in the state for its own use. Large amounts of milk by-products such as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are produced in Utah. Large amounts of alfalfa are also grown in the irrigated sections, thus providing excellent pasture for the growing out and feeding of market hogs.

The production and fattening of hogs in conjunction with dairy-farming has proved to be well adapted to the agricultural program in large dairy centers.

As an alternative, a yogurt was produced from buffalo skim milk with the addition of microbial transglutaminase (TG; 1  U. g− 1 protein) and <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP; 1 and 2 % “w/w”). For comparison, a fat-free variant without TG or BMP and a full-fat yogurt were studied. Monitoring the pH drop during incubation time revealed that TG did not interfere with the pH reduction, while BMP addition accelerated the decline in pH. TG treatment or BMP addition substantially improved the water holding capacity functionality of the yogurt gel. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the addition of BMP enhanced the reactivity of TG as indicated by the appearance of high molecular weight protein polymer bands. These results were confirmed by scanning electron microscope analysis. The addition of TG and BMP, either individually or in combination, showed a marked impact on gel network, resulting in a more compact and dense gel structure accompanied by irregular agglomerated clusters of protein aggregates. Fat-free yogurts of individually BMP addition exhibited the most desirable organoleptic attributes as indicated by a sensory panel and were perceived as similar to the full-fat yogurt perception. Overall, the addition of TG or BMP appeared to have potential as a valuable alternative in fat-free yogurt production, and BMP can be used as a source of extra protein, which in turn offers promising option to develop innovative functional fat-free yogurt...|$|R

In this study MFGM materials were produced from several dairy sources such as buttermilk (BM), butter serum (BS) and buttermilk whey (BMW) by microfiltration (MF). The obtained materials, depending on the sources, were called BM-MFGM, BS-MFGM and BMW-MFGM, respectively. The compositions of starting materials and the isolated MFGM materials {{as well as their}} emulsifying properties were analyzed and compared. As expected, the MF resulted in enrichment of polar lipids (PLs), major components of MFGM. On dry matter basis, BM-MFGM and BS-MFGM were about 2. 5 times higher in PLs compared to their beginning materials while BMW-MFGM was about 8. 3 times compared to <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the microfiltered products still contained a high amount of non-MFGM proteins such as caseins, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin. Emulsions of 35 % soya oil in water were prepared with the mentioned materials using a homogenizer at various pressures. Generally, emulsions prepared with BMP and butter serum powder had significantly higher particle sizes than those prepared with the MFGM materials.
