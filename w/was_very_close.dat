5|$|A third alternative, {{noting that}} Edward in 978 <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to ruling on his own, proposes that Ealdorman Ælfhere {{was behind the}} killing so as to {{preserve}} his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for Ælfhere's actions earlier in the reign. John notes this and interprets Ælfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the assassination.|$|E
5|$|Arnold <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to his mother, {{who died}} in 1759. His father's {{alcoholism}} worsened after her death, and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister. His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness, was refused communion by his church, and eventually died in 1761.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Douglas <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> {{with her}} mother after her parents' separation. She {{witnessed}} her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors. Following her mother's death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at The Miami Herald, in the 1920s, she suffered {{the first of three}} nervous breakdowns.|$|E

5|$|Djibouti had six {{competitors}} in athetlics, and one each in judo and swimming.

He also {{competed in the}} 800 m, but failed to advance past the semifinals. Anass Houssein lost his first match and was eliminated from competition. Bourhan Abro finished 74th and did not advance past the first round.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, but he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E

5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian, now the WIBF, WBA and WBO Female Flyweight Champion, {{made the}} first defense of all her titles against Nadia Raoui on 24 April 2010.

After ten close rounds, Kentikian won via split decision.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{fighting}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> {{many of the}} Confederates were killed before {{they had a chance}} to retreat. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry drove the rebels {{to the end of the}} field, only to be partially driven back by a second group of Confederate cavalrymen. After the regiment was reinforced by the rest of Capehart's brigade, the Confederates were driven from the area, and numerous battle flags were captured.|$|E
5|$|Together in {{a hostile}} environment, Conroy's {{relationship}} to the Duchess <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> with him serving as her comptroller and private secretary for the next nineteen years, as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent. While {{it is not clear}} which of the two was more responsible for devising the Kensington System, it was created to govern young Victoria's upbringing.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Truman was {{interested}} in music, reading, war, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close.</b> As president, he solicited {{political as well as}} personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to Ada, {{his wife}} of 56 years; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs' {{substantial}} wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 {{and ran for the}} rest of his life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. Knighted in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.|$|E
5|$|John Martin Scripps {{was born}} in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, 9 December 1959 to Leonard and Jean Scripps, an East End lorry driver and a Fleet Street barmaid respectively. He {{travelled}} often in childhood, occasionally accompanied by his father, with whom he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close.</b> Leonard Scripps committed suicide when his son was nine. After his father's death, Scripps developed problems with reading and writing, which led to him leaving school {{at the age of}} 15. After dropping out of school he continued to travel, raising money for his trips by doing odd jobs and selling antiques.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{used this}} {{equation}} {{to calculate the}} amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years {{a wide variety of}} values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to 0.0033 (similar to the number Langley used), not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute over}} who had {{actually}} discovered the object delayed {{the acceptance of}} any name, or of formal classification of the object as a dwarf planet. On 17 September 2008, the IAU announced that the two bodies in charge of naming dwarf planets, the Committee on Small Body Nomenclature (CSBN) and the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), had decided on the Caltech proposal of Haumea. At the CSBN, {{the outcome of the}} voting <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close,</b> eventually being decided by a single vote. However, the date of the discovery was listed on the announcement as March 7, 2003, the location of discovery as the Sierra Nevada Observatory, {{and the name of the}} discoverer was left blank.|$|E
5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman created the first substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E
5|$|The reformers' {{propaganda}} {{claimed that}} England had been unified {{as a result}} of the wide acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E
