5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from <b>wolframite</b> that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{productiveness}} of its ore deposits, the Greifensteine {{are also}} a well-known site of many different minerals and their varieties. As of 2014, a total of around 50 minerals and 10 varieties have been discovered here, including inter alia the well-known minerals andalusite, beryl, gypsum, haematite, muscovite, sphalerite, pyrite, topaz, wavellite and zircon, as well as various garnets, tourmalines, (dravite, elbaite, schorl) and <b>wolframites.</b> There are also rare minerals such as childrenite and natrodufrénite, {{as well as the}} radioactive minerals autunite and torbernite.|$|R
40|$|Luminescent {{properties}} of magnesium tungstate monocrystals grown by two different methods are studied. Only the exciton luminescence of these crystals themselves is observed. Temperature {{dependence of the}} low-energy range in the luminescence excitation spectra is described by the Urbach rule. Slope coefficient σ 0 = 0. 74 obtained from this dependence implies autolocalization of the excitons in MgWO$_ 4 $. The processes of electronic excitations relaxation are considered depending {{on the structure of}} valence band in MgWO$_ 4 $ and in other <b>wolframites,</b> ZnWO$_ 4 $ and CdWO$_ 4 $. In contrast to ZnWO$_ 4 $ and CdWO$_ 4 $, the d-states of the cation do not participate in formation of the MgWO$_ 4 $ valence band. Using the excitation spectra measured in the range of the fundamental absorption (4 – 20 eV), it is shown that this difference manifests itself in relaxation of electronic excitations and may be the cause of the relatively low light yield of MgWO$_ 4 $...|$|R
40|$|Raman {{scattering}} {{measurements and}} lattice-dynamics calculations {{have been performed}} on magnesium tungstate under high pressure up to 41 GPa. Experiments {{have been carried out}} under a selection of different pressure-media. The influence of non-hydrostaticity on the structural properties of MgWO 4 and isomorphic compounds is examined. Under quasi-hydrostatic conditions a phase transition has been found at 26 GPa in MgWO 4. The high-pressure phase has been tentatively assigned to a triclinic structure similar to that of CuWO 4. We also report and discuss the Raman symmetries, frequencies, and pressure coefficients in the low- and high-pressure phases. In addition, the Raman frequencies for different <b>wolframites</b> are compared and the variation of the mode frequency with the reduced mass across the family is investigated. Finally, the accuracy of theoretical calculations is systematically discussed for MgWO 4, MnWO 4, FeWO 4, CoWO 4, NiWO 4, ZnWO 4, and CdWO 4. Comment: 36 pages, 9 figures, 4 table...|$|R
25|$|In April 2009, Brownback {{introduced}} the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of conflict minerals, such as cassiterite, <b>wolframite,</b> and tantalum.

However, measures {{to control the}} sale of conflict minerals were later included in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Brownback voted against.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the <b>wolframite</b> series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
500|$|Tungsten is a {{chemical}} element with symbol W and atomic number 74. The name tungsten {{comes from the}} former Swedish name for the tungstate mineral scheelite, from tung sten [...] "heavy stone". Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds. It {{was identified as a}} new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include <b>wolframite</b> and scheelite.|$|E
2500|$|Tungsten has a {{rich history}} {{dating back to}} its {{discovery}} during the 18th century. Peter Woulfe {{was the first to}} recognize a new element in the naturally occurring mineral <b>wolframite.</b> Tungsten was originally known as wolfram, explaining the choice of [...] "W" [...] for its elemental symbol. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele contributed to its discovery with his studies on the mineral scheelite.|$|E
2500|$|The IUPAC {{names for}} {{elements}} {{are intended for}} use in the official languages. At {{the time of the first}} edition of the IUPAC Red Book (which contains the rules for inorganic compounds), those languages were English and French; now English is the sole official language. However, other languages still have their own names for elements. The chemical symbol for tungsten, W, is based on the German name wolfram, which is found in <b>wolframite</b> and comes from the German for [...] "wolf's foam", how the mineral was known to Saxon miners. The name tungsten means [...] "heavy stone", a description of scheelite, another mineral in which tungsten is found. The German names for hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are Wasserstoff (water substance), Sauerstoff (acid substance), and Stickstoff (smothering substance). Russian names for hydrogen, oxygen and carbon are [...] "vodorod", [...] "kislorod" [...] and [...] "uglerod" [...] (generating water, acid and coal respectively).|$|E
50|$|<b>Wolframite,</b> (Fe,Mn)WO4, is an iron {{manganese}} tungstate mineral {{that is the}} intermediate between ferberite (Fe2+ rich) and hübnerite (Mn2+ rich). Along with scheelite, the <b>wolframite</b> series {{are the most important}} tungsten ore minerals. <b>Wolframite</b> is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. Associated minerals include cassiterite, scheelite, bismuth, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite.|$|E
50|$|As hübnerite {{is a rare}} endmember of the <b>wolframite</b> {{group the}} {{structure}} of the family will be {{the structure of the}} members. Distorted tetrahedral (WO4) and octahedral ((Fe.

In ferberite the percentage of WO3 is around 76.3% while in hübnerite the percentage is around 76.6%. In natural occurrence the percent range fall within 20-80 percent of the <b>wolframite</b> series. In the past it was thought the <b>wolframite</b> family possess orthorhombic symmetry but in fact it is possess monoclinic symmetry. Short prismatic, flattened or wedge-shaped are the common crystals of the <b>wolframite</b> itself. In some rare occasions the crystals occur doubly terminated. It is common for the faces to striated parallel to the c axis. In most cases <b>wolframite</b> is embedded in quartz as subparallel crystalline masses.|$|E

50|$|Since hübnerite {{comes from}} a family with only two end members {{it would be easier}} to explain the {{composition}} of the <b>wolframite</b> family since there is not enough data on hübnerite itself. The primary formula of the <b>wolframite</b> series is (Fe,Mn)WO4. The domination of either iron or manganese would result in forming one of two minerals. The iron dominated one will result in forming ferberite while the manganese dominated one will result in forming hübnerite. Hübnerite is rarer than ferberite due to the difficulty of iron and manganese substitution. There is also a magnesium substitution involved to form an MgWO4. This magnesium rich usually referred to as <b>wolframite</b> but it is not a mineral it is a crystal scintillator.|$|E
50|$|Hübnerite {{is a rare}} mineral {{from the}} rare family <b>wolframite.</b> It is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} principle ores of tungsten.

5000|$|The {{roasting}} process involves drying using a Drytech pre-dryer that thoroughly dries the pre-concentrate before feeding into {{a reduction}} kiln. This kiln uses diesel as a reductant to generate carbon monoxide, which reacts with haematite and other iron oxides in the feed at approximately 700°C, to create magnetite or maghemite whilst leaving other minerals largely unaffected. This process changes paramagnetic hematite into ferromagnetic maghemite/magnetite. <b>Wolframite,</b> like hematite, is paramagnetic and without this reduction step separation of hematite and <b>wolframite</b> {{would be impossible}} using magnetic separators.|$|E
