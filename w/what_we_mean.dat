In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that [...] "socialists must sing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> and sing it like we mean it". [...] Under Bush's influence the [...] "music of the workers" [...] moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, Arthur Bourchier's mid-1920s pamphlet Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism, towards an expression with broader popular appeal.|$|E

Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were consistent; {{if there is a}} proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their {{consistency}} using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display.

Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress.

2500|$|When {{we try to}} be definite, as to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> when we {{say that}} this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has [...] "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.|$|E

I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore.... The hymnal aspect {{of many of these}} songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction." [...] Music journalist Robert Christgau felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a [...] Composer Atticus Ross explains that the album has [...] "an element of cliché that's grown around it". He references a sketch from the television show Portlandia in which [...] "your classic hipster musicians... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.' This is exactly the same as Pet Sounds.'" [...] Commentator C.W. Maloney mused: [...] "The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you have to wonder, given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> when we call it a classic or Wilson a genius.
