500|$|During the film's fire scene, Cody {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the barroom. [...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E

There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Canvassing" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Marlene Griggs-Knope, Leslie's mother and an important public figure in the Pawnee school system. Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want my daughter to be successful, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> always tell her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and he felt her relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old and doing a piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in early 1966 to expand the group, {{resulting}} in the recruitment of Mark Landon (lead guitar) and Doug Rhodes (organ), previously a session musician for the Association. To reflect on the revamped line-up, Bonniwell changed the band's name to the Music Machine. [...] Another purpose for coining the name, Bonniwell explained, was [...] "I seguewayed [...] all the original material with musical segueways [...] [...] So we would be on stage for like an hour and ten minutes, wall-to-wall music just nonstop, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> called us the Music Machine". The band built a name for itself with its performances in local clubs in Los Angeles. [...] With Bonniwell as the de facto leader and creative force of the band, the Music Machine began to develop a blend of gritty 60s punk and psychedelia, and a repertoire encompassing Bonniwell's self-penned material along with some cover songs. The band's sound was highlighted by the authoritative and versatile vocals provided by Bonniwell, with an energized technique that juxtaposed the styles of Mick Jagger and Sky Saxon. Unlike these two contemporaries, Bonniwell possessed unusually good intonation in long-sustained passages, {{and the ability to}} breakdown phrases into a series of slow pulsations. The Music Machine's artistic stance was also highlighted by Landon's wiry guitar playing, Olsen's reverberant bass, and Edgar's cymbal-punctuated drumming, which gave the band a harder-edged sound than many of their contemporaries.|$|E

And then it turned out that she was very popular, so I felt that I needed to finish her story quickly, so she wasn’t just another Dredd villain {{simmering}} in the background for years and years, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> pushed for her to be the Big Bad of ‘Trifecta’. It was literally me saying, ‘I have a villain going spare, can we use her?’" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{regards to}} writing and growing old, Unsworth said, [...] "With time I {{have grown more}} sparing with the words. I think less of fire-works and flourishes.

This is more difficult, <b>I</b> think, <b>which</b> may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> find writing novels so challenging and exacting." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton ski mask while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and put you in this trance, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being said, she wanted to focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, if you think about it. Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese {{media had}} bombarded us {{with so many}} {{in-depth}} profiles of the Aum cult perpetrators—the 'attackers'—forming such a slick, seductive narrative that the average citizen—the 'victim'—was an afterthought... <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wanted, if at all possible, {{to get away from}} any formula; to recognise that each person on the subway that morning had a face, a life, a family, hopes and fears, contradictions and dilemmas—and that all these factors had a place in the drama...|$|E

In a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph Fadlallah said: [...] "I was {{not the one who}} launched the idea of so-called suicide bombings...but I have certainly argued in favour of them. I do, though, make a distinction between them and attacks that target people in a state of peace - <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> opposed what happened on September 11."The situation of the Palestinians is quite different, because they {{are in a state of}} war with Israel. They are not aiming to kill civilians but, in war, civilians do get killed. Don't forget, the Palestinians are living under mountains of pressure."They have had their land stolen, their families killed, their homes destroyed, and the Israelis are using weapons, such as the F16 aircraft, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> meant only for major wars. There is no other way for the Palestinians to push back those mountains, apart from martyrdom operations." ...|$|R

But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|R

[...] "I thought {{that we were going to}} show what it’s like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated. There are a lot of story points and ideas I thought we were going to hit upon, but they decided to take it another route." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Gremlins was {{conceived}} by Chris Columbus. As Columbus explained, his inspiration {{came from his}} loft, when at night [...] "what sounded like a platoon of mice would come out and to hear them skittering around in the blackness was really creepy". He then wrote the original screenplay as a spec script to show potential employers that he had writing abilities. The story was not actually intended to be filmed until Steven Spielberg {{took an interest in}} turning it into a film. As Spielberg explained, [...] "It's one of the most original things I've come across in many years, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> bought it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Microsoft {{has made}} an effort to {{maintain}} backward compatibility. To achieve this, when developing new versions of Windows, Microsoft sometimes implemented workarounds to allow compatibility with third-party software that used the prior version in an undocumented or even inadvisable way. Raymond Chen, a Microsoft developer who works on the Windows API, has said: [...] "I could probably write for months solely about bad things apps do and what we had to do to get them to work again (often in spite of themselves). <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> get particularly furious when people accuse Microsoft of maliciously breaking applications during OS upgrades.

I tried to update Thor and put him into a superhero costume, {{but he was still}} Thor." [...] The story was included in Tales of the Unexpected #16, from 1957; and although the character had a different design, some details would be reused by Kirby when he created the Marvel Comics version. And in a 1992 interview, Kirby said [...] " [...] knew the Thor legends very well, but I wanted to modernize them.

These awards normally go to deserving individuals, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have many times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals."
