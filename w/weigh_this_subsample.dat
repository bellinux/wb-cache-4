30|$|In {{order to}} be able to say {{something}} about the representativeness of our sample, the sample should be compared to the total population. District A provided us with necessary statistics for all employees within their district for 2014. If we concentrate on the subsample recruited from District A, our sample consists of 48.7 % of the total number of employees in this district and 51 % of the full-time equivalents. If <b>this</b> <b>subsample</b> was perfectly representative in terms of sick leave, we should expect to have around 51 % of the employees’ sick leave days in our sample. The actual number of self-certified sick leave days in <b>this</b> <b>subsample</b> is 52 %, which is just above the expected share. However, the share of GP-certified sick leave days is somewhat low (40 %). The reason might be that the employees having a sick leave spell during the period in which the survey was conducted, were harder to reach. Nevertheless, the questionnaires were sent home to those on longer sick leave spells, giving them a chance to participate.|$|R

40|$|New moderate-resolution {{mid-infrared}} spectroscopy at 10 micron of 27 infrared galaxies is presented. The galaxies {{have been}} chosen from three 60 micron selected and one 12 micron selected complete flux-limited catalogs of galaxies; 17 of these sources have L_IR(8 [...] 1000 micron) >= 5 times 10 ^ 11 L_sun. A high-resolution spectrum of the source Arp 299 B 1 is also presented. Combining these new results with previously published results, a nearly complete 60 micron selected flux limited subsample, with L_IR(8 [...] 1000 micron) >= 1. 6 times 10 ^ 11 L_sun of 25 galaxies is defined.

The study assesses various health indexes to compare them with studies aiming to describe standard health values in French or European populations. The hypothesis was that competitive swimming increases all health indexes. Due to the large sample of participants (n[*]=[*] 490) with no significant difference in proportion with all swimmers selected for the event, <b>this</b> <b>subsample</b> can be considered as a representative of swimmers in French championships.|$|R
