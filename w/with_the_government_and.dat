The centre was not affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> trained bodyguards, debt collectors and private security forces, although in November 2006 the centre {{was used by the}} Vityaz for a qualification examination due to their own centre being under renovation. The targets were photographed when the chairman of the Federation Council of Russia Sergei Mironov visited the centre on 7 November 2006.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{intention}} of legislation concerning the elected President that the initiative to refer the question to the Tribunal should lie <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government,</b> <b>and</b> generally not with the President whose recourse was in vetoing the legislation.

5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided {{with the arrival of}} replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E

5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
