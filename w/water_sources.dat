5|$|In 1996 the Malvern Hills District Council {{appointed}} a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor Rose Garrard proposed to the MHDC {{the creation of}} a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of its plan to beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a Spring Water Arts Project to map <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> around the hills. Garrard undertook a two-month artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of over two hundred <b>water</b> <b>sources.</b> Garrard was commissioned to create the drinking spout, Malvhina, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.|$|E

Bir el Mazar was about half way between Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border.

40|$|Abstract. The {{safety of}} the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area is the premise of urban safety and {{the basis for the}} {{sustainable}} urban development and urban-rural coordinated development. The contradiction between <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection and the development of towns in the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area is increasingly prominent, and the restrictions of <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection on the towns in the <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area have seriously restricted the development of towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area. Based on deep analysis of the principal contradictions and problems between urban <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area protection and the development of the towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area, the paper has proposed the spatial planning pathways and the relevant public policy suggestions for the coordinated development of urban <b>water</b> <b>source</b> protection and the towns in <b>water</b> <b>source</b> area...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} access to safe and {{reliable}} water supplies has received increased government attention in Ethiopia. As a result, the national coverage rate for this service has gradually improved. Yet {{millions of people in}} rural areas still do not get drinking water from an improved <b>water</b> <b>source.</b> While expanding improved <b>water</b> <b>source</b> schemes is generally essential, it is equally important to ensure that the schemes have increased users' satisfaction with water quality and availability for everyday use. Using household survey data and employing univariate and bivariate probit models, this paper attempts to investigate the effect of access to an improved <b>water</b> <b>source</b> on users' satisfaction with both quality and availability of water. The study findings suggest that access to an improved <b>water</b> <b>source</b> significantly raised household satisfaction with both quality and availability of water.

5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up Mauna Kea {{were probably}} guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found.

However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E

Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus.

Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s.

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of <b>water</b> <b>sources,</b> the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E

A study of the bohor reedbuck's diet in Rwenzori Mountains National Park (Uganda) revealed that, throughout the year, the most preferred species was Sporobolus consimilis.

Bohor reedbuck preferred Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris in the wet season, and switched to Sporobolus pyramidalis and Panicum repens in the dry season. Though they rarely feed on dicots, these can include Capparis and Sida species. On regularly burnt pastures, the bohor reedbuck feeds on Imperata species, while in places close by <b>water</b> <b>sources,</b> it eats Leersia and newly sprouted Vossia species (like topi and puku).|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, both sides had large numbers of troops available for redeployment, and the British decided to move their Suez Canal defences from positions on the canal eastwards into the Sinai desert. Murray aimed to extend the railway and water pipeline to Katia, so that a permanent forward Imperial base of 50,000 men could be established. In February 1916, he requested permission from the War Office in London to extend this infrastructure further across the Sinai to El Arish. He considered that such an advance along the northern route, combined with the destruction of the central route's <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and regular patrols from a base at El Arish, would permanently secure the Suez Canal. An advance to Katia was agreed by the War Office, but no decision was made regarding an advance to El Arish.|$|E
