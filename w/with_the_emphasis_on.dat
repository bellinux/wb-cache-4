5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E

25|$|The Ashley Library is {{recognized}} as one of the most important collections of 19th-century English literary manuscripts. The collection spans the period from Coleridge to Conrad, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> poetical manuscripts and the correspondence of writers, critics, collectors and bibliographers. The collection is strong in manuscripts of the Younger Romantics and of the Pre-Raphaelites, together with Swinburne. Wise's lack of scholarship and his practice of dispersing related manuscripts throughout the collection, made it a particularly difficult library to catalogue.|$|E

The best-known devotees are the Nayanars from southern India. The most popular Shaiva teacher of the south was Basava, while of the north it was Gorakhnath. Female saints include figures like Akkamadevi, Lalleshvari and Molla.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{letters from}} readers in The Ladder {{appeared}} that expressed exasperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> conformity in the DOB. In the 1970s, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon reflected that by contemporary standards, the early {{ideals of the}} DOB for integration and adjustment of the lesbian into society were outmoded, but they remembered that in the 1950s and early 1960s many {{gay men and lesbians}} considered those ideals unreachable, and this approach radical. The DOB never had the number of members comparable to the Mattachine Society's. Although some may have considered the DOB's ideals unrealistic, some also considered them too tame.|$|E
25|$|After the dreadfully {{desultory}} affair at the Sydney Football Stadium {{a fortnight}} before, the ten-try bonanza {{turned on by}} the two sides at Ballymore was a timely reminder that running rugby, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the players and not the whistle, was what the public wanted. Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia. A close study of the video replay shows that Norling made at least six major mistakes, five of which led to points being scored. Nevertheless he was hailed as a hero for his willingness to let the players be the stars.|$|E
25|$|Wright's {{projects}} {{during this}} period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the Winslow House, combined Sullivanesque ornamentation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), Heller House (1896), Rollin Furbeck House (1897), and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the Dutch Colonial Revival style Bagley House (1894), Tudor Revival style Moore House I (1895), and Queen Anne style Charles E. Roberts House (1896).While Wright {{could not afford to}} turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.|$|E

25|$|In the US and Canada, {{beginning}} in the mid 1970s, he created comprehensive teaching programs combining the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali. Those were grounded in the scriptural tradition of Hatha yoga system in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Siva Samhita, and Gherand Samita, Yoga Vashishta. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> strength and flexibility he developed Fitness Asanas to increase physical endurance. Pranayama, a stable control and expansion of energy, was given prominence in focused support of meditation. Kirtan, mudras, the theory of gunas of Samkhya and the subtle body, or SukShma sharira of Tantra and Vedantic philosophy were also included. Regular and persistent practice (sadhana and Abhyasa) augmented scriptural references and emphasized experience through regular routine.|$|E
25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with fellow human beings, and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered important for a healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they {{turn out to be}} false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E
25|$|Monash {{was born}} in Dudley Street, West Melbourne, Victoria, on 27 June 1865, the son of Louis Monash and his wife Bertha, née Manasse. He was born to Jewish parents, both from Krotoschin, in the Posen province, Kingdom of Prussia (now Krotoszyn in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland); the family name was {{originally}} spelt Monasch (pronounced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> the second syllable). The family spoke German as their native language. As {{might have been expected}} from a man brought up by cultivated German parents who had arrived in Australia barely two years before John's birth, Monash spoke, read, and wrote German fluently. However, from 1914 until his death, Sir John Monash had no good reason to attract attention to his German background.|$|E

25|$|Both Stähelin's {{parents were}} medical doctors. After preparatory {{school and a}} {{classical}} education <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> Greek and Latin, Stähelin studied medicine in Basel, Zürich and Florence (1944–1950). His first position after graduation was at the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Basel (1951–1954) where he investigated the morphology and sporulation of anthrax bacilli {{with the help of}} the then-new phase contrast microscope. In May 1951, Stähelin was the first to observe naked anthrax bacilli protoplasts, called gymnoplasts, which had left behind their empty cell walls. A year later, during his studies of their osmotic behavior, he discovered and described the occasional fusion of naked protoplasts. This seminal paper in German immediately caught the attention of the bacterial geneticist Joshua Lederberg, who personally requested a copy.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} {{production}} in England after Daly's success {{was that of}} F.R. Benson. Originally performed in the Prince's Theatre, Manchester in 1889, the production then moved to the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1890, before settling at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1893, where it {{became one of the}} most popular and often performed plays in Benson's repertory. The play was regularly performed there until the 1920s and was revived at theatres around the country up to 1932. Starring Benson's wife, Constance Benson and Benson himself as Petruchio, Benson followed Daly's example in rewriting and restructuring, such as truncating the Bianca subplot. Unlike Daly, however, Benson also removed the Induction. The production was very much a farce, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> broad physical comedy in which Petruchio athletically leaps about the stage terrorizing a relatively passive Katherina. In its early days, it received generally strong reviews, but by 1910, the political climate had changed somewhat; the 1909 Stratford by-election had seen suffragette protests, and henceforth some critics expressed discomfort with Benson's use of farce to depict what had now become a socially relevant situation. Indeed, in the 1912 season, suffragette activist Violet Vanbrugh replaced Constance Benson in the role of Katherina, although her performance was roundly criticised for failing to bring the anticipated political edge to the character.|$|E
