5|$|Like its predecessor, Dragon Quest VI did {{not receive}} an English-language {{localization}} because of being cost-ineffective. At 4MB, {{it was one of}} the largest games made for the SNES as well as the largest the console could support <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> bank-switching circuitry to the cartridge, and translating it would have necessitated even bigger and more expensive ROMs. In addition, the game was a late release for the SNES and by the time an English localization could be finished, Enix had already dropped support for the console in North America and moved to the PlayStation.|$|E

In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot {{was the first one}} to be saved in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E

5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It {{is more likely that}} it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering that the number of castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E
5|$|The game's core feature, its Nemesis system, was praised. According to Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar, {{the system}} {{elevated}} Shadow of Mordor to excellence by making its villains memorable and adding personality to its protagonist. Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb agreed, writing {{that the system}} created many distinctive characters and its side content extended the game's longevity. Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski said that the system made each playthrough unique and made the game stand out from other action games. Chris Carter of Destructoid found the system gimmicky, since it failed to create unique villains; it added different appearances and weaknesses to villains <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> personality.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{final day}} started poorly for England, with Compton edging Johnston to a diving Miller at second slip {{from the second}} ball of the day. England had lost a wicket <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> to their {{overnight}} total. Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former. He then trapped Coxon lbw two balls later in the same over. Eight runs later, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000 — a record for a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first at}} the home of cricket. Centurion Morris fell at 3/166 and new batsman Miller was trapped lbw for four shortly after. Brown came in at 4/173 and helped Lindsay Hassett rebuild the innings after the two quick wickets. Both men scored slowly, {{averaging}} more than three and half minutes for each run. After putting on a partnership of 43, Hassett was bowled by Yardley, who then trapped Brown for 24 to leave Australia stumbling at 6/225. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace. Australia managed to avoid further collapse a counterattack from the tail saw them to 350 before they bowled England out for 215. The tourists batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day. Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329; Australia had lost 3/33 but steadied to reach stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven. After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409. In 88 minutes of play, Australia had added 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Alec Coxon after lunch <b>without</b> <b>adding</b> to his score for 32, after an 87-run partnership with Miller, with the score at 5/416. Bradman eventually declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. The home team lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs. Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the centuries he made in each of his two previous Tests at Lord’s on the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.|$|E

NPC 1 L 1 knockout (L 1 -KO) mice {{were recently}} {{shown to be}} resistant to high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity in one study, which was contrary to several other studies. Careful comparison of dietary compositions in these studies implies a potential role of dietary cholesterol in regulating weight gain. To examine this potential, wild-type (WT) and L 1 -KO mice were fed one of three sets of diets for various durations: (1) a HFD <b>without</b> <b>added</b> cholesterol for 5 weeks; (2) a high-carbohydrate diet with or <b>without</b> <b>added</b> cholesterol for 5 weeks; or (3) a synthetic HFD with or <b>without</b> <b>added</b> cholesterol for 18 weeks. We found that L 1 -KO mice were protected against diet-induced weight gain only on a diet <b>without</b> <b>added</b> cholesterol but not on a diet containing 0. 16 % or 0. 2 % (w/w) cholesterol, an amount similar to a typical Western diet, regardless of the major energy source of the diet. Food intake and intestinal fat absorption were similar between the two genotypes. Intestinal cholesterol absorption was blocked, and fecal cholesterol excretion increased in L 1 -KO mice. Under all diets, L 1 -KO mice were protected from hepatosteatosis. In conclusion, increasing dietary cholesterol restores diet-induced weight gain in mice deficient in NPC 1 L 1 -dependent cholesterol absorption...|$|R
