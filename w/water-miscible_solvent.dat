40|$|The {{physical}} properties {{and the methods}} used for interconversion of three forms of cholesterol oxidase extracted from Nocardia rhodochrous by treatment with Triton X- 100, trypsin or buffer alone provide evidence that these forms differ chiefly in the possession or absence of a hydrophobic anchor region connected by a trypsin-sensitive region. The hydrophobic domain normally integrates the enzyme into the cell membrane and confers amphipathic properties on the solubilized enzyme, causing adsorption to hydrophobic resins, aggregation when detergent is removed and formation of mixed micelles with detergent and cholesterol resulting in surface-dilution kinetic behaviour and activation by relatively high concentrations of <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents.</b> By contrast, only the enzymic fragment is extracted with trypsin and it behaves as a conventional soluble enzyme and does not aggregate or interact with hydrophobic resins, detergents or <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents.</b> As no phospholipid could be detected in the enzyme extracts, the detergent appears to act as a substitute for the cell-membrane lipids that would normally interact with the hydrophobic region.

40|$|Pseudolatexes were {{obtained}} by a new process based on an emulsification-diffusion technique involving partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents.</b> The preparation method consisted of emulsifying an organic solution of polymer (saturated with water) in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent (saturated with solvent) using conventional stirrers, followed by direct solvent distillation. The technique relies on the rapid displacement of the solvent from the internal into the external phase which thereby provokes polymer aggregation. Nanoparticle formation is believed to occur because rapid solvent diffusion produces regions of local supersaturation near the interface, and nanoparticles are formed due to the ensuing interfacial phase transformations and polymer aggregation that occur in these interfacial domains. Using this method, {{it was possible to}} prepare pseudolatexes of biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymers such as poly(D,L-lactic acid) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone), Eudragit E, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate using ethyl acetate or 2 -butanone as partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents</b> and poly(vinyl alcohol) or poloxamer 407 as stabilizing agent. A transition from nano- to microparticles was observed at high polymer concentrations.

Nanoparticulate dispersions were produced by an emulsification-diffusion method involving the use of partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents</b> and the mutual saturation of the aqueous and organic phases prior to the emulsification in order to reduce the initial thermodynamic instability of the emulsion. Because of the self-emulsifying properties of the methacrylic acid copolymers, it was possible to prepare aqueous dispersions of colloidal size containing up to 30 % wt/vol of Eudragit RL, RS, and E using 2 -butanone or methyl acetate as partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvents,</b> but without any surfactant. However, in the case of the cationic Eudragit E, protonation of the tertiary amine groups by acidification of the aqueous phase was necessary to improve the emulsion stability in the absence of surfactant and subsequently to prevent droplet coalescence during evaporation. In addition, a pseudolatex of Eudragit E was used to validate the coating properties of the formulation for solid dosage forms. Film-coated tablets of quinidine sulfate showed a transparent glossy continuous film that was firmly attached to the tablet. The dissolution profile of quinidine sulfate from the tablets coated with the Eudragit E pseudolatex was comparable to that of tablets coated with an acetonic solution of Eudragit E. Furthermore, both types of coating ensured similar taste masking.

40|$|In this study, the emulsification-diffusion method {{traditionally}} used {{to prepare}} polymeric nanoparticles was adapted to obtain lipidic nanospheres (LN) using four model lipids. The method consists of dissolving the lipid in a partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvent</b> (previously saturated with water) {{at room temperature}} or at controlled temperature depending on lipid solubility. This organic phase is emulsified in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent (saturated with solvent) by conventional stirring at the same temperature used to dissolve the lipid. This oil-in-water emulsion is then diluted with an excess of water at controlled temperature in order to provoke the diffusion from the internal phase into the external phase thereby causing lipid aggregation {{in the form of}} LN. This new approach for the preparation of LN has clear advantages over the existing methods, namely: (i) it is efficient and versatile; (ii) easy implementation and scaling up (with no need of high energy sources); (iii) high reproducibility and narrow size distribution; (iv) less physical stress (i. e., long exposure to high temperatures and to mechanical dispersion); (v) {{it is not necessary to}} dissolve the drug in the melted lipid. The selection of the <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvent</b> and the stabilizers are critical parameters to obtain lipidic particles in the nanometric range. In general, solvents with high water miscibility and stabilizers able to form stable emulsions are preferred. The results demonstrated that it was possible to reduce the particle size by increasing the process temperature, the stirring rate, the amount of stabilizer, and by lowering the amount of lipid. Control of the preparative variables allowed to obtain LN with diameters under 100 nm. It was found that the influence of preparative parameters was associated with a mechanism based on a physicochemical instability. In this sense, it is suggested that the rapid solvent diffusion produces regions of local supersaturation near the interface, and LN are formed due to the ensuing interfacial phase transformations and lipid aggregation that occur in these interfacial domains. In terms of stability, only poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAL) was able to preserve the physical stability of the dispersion for long periods after preparation. This effect was attributed to the ability of PVAL chains to form a strongly attached layer on the nanoparticle surface with an excellent repulsion effect...|$|E

We use a partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvent</b> mixture (dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO + dichloromethane DCM) as precursor drug/polymer solution for NPs nucleation. We extrude this partially water-miscible solution into an aqueous medium and synthesized uniform PLGA NPs with higher drug loading ability and longer sustained-release ability than conventional microfluidic or batch preparation methods. The size of NPs could be precisely tuned by changing the flow rate ratios, polymer concentration, and volume ratio of DCM to DMSO (VDCM/VDMSO) in the precursor emulsion. We investigated the mechanism of the formation of NPs and the effect of VDCM/VDMSO on drug release kinetics.

Although several of such solvents {{have been used in}} both drug delivery and interventional radiology, their safety profile is a concern.

Their in vivo hemodynamic toxicity in male adult sheep after infra-renal aorta catheterization has been estimated with respect to the arterial and venous pressures, as well as the heart rate. Saline solution was used as a control. Three different volumes (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mL) were infused rapidly. An increase in arterial pressure and concomitant decrease in venous pressure, which we considered as signs of a cardiovascular toxicity, were observed to a differing extent for all organic solvents. Changes in heart rate were negligible. Based on the intensity of arterial pressure change after a 1 -mL infusion, a classification of the toxicity of the solvents following intra-arterial infusion is proposed: Solvents devoid of significant cardiovascular toxicity: dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), Glycofurol 75, polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200), diglyme. Solvents with moderate cardiovascular toxicity: tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), ethanol, acetone, Solketal, glycerol formal, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solvents with marked cardiovascular toxicity: propylene glycol, ethyl lactate, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP). Emphasis is put on the relative character of the proposed ranking and on the lack for certain solvents, at least in the open literature, of data pertaining at other forms of toxic effects (e. g., undesirable pharmacological action, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity, and irritating and sensitizing properties), all factors that have to be considered when selecting a proper solvent...|$|R

In this work, Ouzo emulsions were prepared from the ternary mixture toluene-ethanol-water and the emulsion stability was studied by a combination of two techniques: static multiple light scattering and NMR diffusometry. A bimodal distribution of the droplets was found. The light scattering technique revealed the presence of large drops, several micrometer in size. NMR measurements confirmed the large drops but also showed the additional presence of droplets of the order of 100 nm in diameter. The distribution of toluene between the three environments (i) large drops, (ii) small droplets, and (iii) the continuous ethanol-water phase could also be assessed. It was found that addition of an anionic surfactant to the system yielded an improved dispersed system, i. e., more toluene was present as small droplets and less toluene was dissolved in the ethanol-water phase; however the presence of the amphiphile reduced the emulsion stability.

Here, we demonstrated the consistency of the experimental values with the data obtained from the mathematical (such as the neural network) and thermodynamic (such as the Peng-Robinson equation of state) models. These models were built to develop predictive tools in the chosen experimental space for microparticles formulation.

40|$|Poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PLA) {{nanoparticles}} {{were prepared}} by a modified emulsification-diffusion technique. The preparation method consisted of emulsifying {{a solution of}} polymer in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent, previously saturated, followed by diluting the internal phase with an excess of water. Propylene carbonate (PC) {{was used as a}} partially <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvent,</b> due to its ability to dissolve polymers, its low toxicity and its ease of emulsification. PC allowed the obtention of nanospheres in a reproducible and efficient way, using poly(vinyl alcohol) or poloxamer 188 as stabilizing agents. The possibility of using poloxamer 188 to produce PLA nanospheres is an interesting option because of its well known acceptability for parenteral administration. With other well accepted stabilizing agents such as polysorbate 80, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone and dextran, {{it was not possible to}} obtain nanoparticles. The effectiveness of the stabilizing agents in the process was attributed to their ability to avoid coalescence during PC diffusion. The formation mechanism of nanoparticles can be explained by the large interfacial area resulting from emulsification and the gradual reduction of the globule size due to solvent transfer and probably, to the interfacial turbulence generated during diffusion. A higher concentration of polymer was found to rapidly increase the size and polydispersity of nanoparticles. In contrast, an increase in stirring rate and concentration of stabilizer agent were found to reduce moderately the size of the nanoparticles. Other process parameters such as viscosity, pH of the external phase and internal/external phase ratio had limited influence on particle size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Polychlorinated {{hydrocarbons}} are prevalent environmental contaminants whose {{rates of}} biodegrada-tion {{are limited by}} their minimal solubilities in aqueous solutions where the biological reactions take place. In this study, ligninase (LiP) from Phanerochaete chryso-sporium was modified by poly(ethylene glycol) to en-hance its activity and stability for the biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) {{in the presence of}} acetonitrile (MeCN), a <b>water-miscible</b> <b>solvent.</b> The modified enzyme retained 100 % of its activity in aqueous solutions and showed enhanced tolerance against the organic solvent. The activity of the modified enzyme was found to be over twice that of the native enzyme in the presence of 10 % (v/v) MeCN. The solubility of PCP was enhanced signifi-cantly by the addition of MeCN to aqueous solutions, such that it was over 10 -fold more soluble in the pres-ence of 15 % (v/v) MeCN than in pure aqueous buffer solution (from 0. 06 to 0. 65 mM). Capitalizing on the en-hanced substrate solubility and the increased activity of the modified enzyme, the catalytic efficiency of the modi-fied LiP in solutions containing 15 % MeCN was over 11 -fold higher than that of the native enzyme in buffer so-lutions (pH 4. 2) in unoptimized reactor systems (from 44 to 480 mol PCP/mol LiP?h). Continued research both in the use of organic solvents to increase the availability of recalcitrant contaminants and in the modification of en-zymes to enhance their activity and stability in such sol-vents promises to dramatically affect our ability to reme-diate contaminated sites.

30|$|Pure organic {{solvents}} {{should be}} avoided in the first extraction steps because molecules distributed in the interlayers of clay particles in soil may be entrapped by shrinking of the clay when water is removed. Therefore, in the first extraction steps, <b>water-miscible</b> organic <b>solvents</b> should be mixed with small volumes of water, followed by exhaustive extraction pure solvents (or solvent mixtures). Extracts should be combined and concentrated prior to radio-profiling for instance by radio-HPLC or radio-TLC.|$|R

The CA was covalently immobilized within polyurethane (PU) foam by cross-linking. Although PU foam holds water almost 12 times of its weight, {{it was found that}} adsorption isotherm of moisture on PU foam was a Type III indicating that water and PU foam were non-interacting to each other. The activities for the free and immobilized CA were estimated using para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) as the substrate. The enzyme activities were estimated in increasing volume percents of organic solvent in Tris buffer (10 - 90 %). p-NP, {{which is one of the}} products of the hydrolysis reaction of p-NPA, was characterized in the presence of organic solvents and it was observed that its aborptivities were decreased significantly as the organic solvent percentages were increased indicating that p-NP and the <b>water-miscible</b> organic <b>solvent</b> form a complex through mostly a hydrogen bonding. The free CA showed decreasing activity up to critical percentages of organic solvent (40 - 60 %), and then exhibited an increasing activity. The immobilized CA showed decreasing activity in acetonitrile at percentages up to 50 %, and then lost its total activity at higher acetonitrile percentages, however, the immobilized CA exhibited no activity in ethanol at percentages above 10 %. Stability tests showed that the immobilized CA was dramatically inactivated in the organic solvents at percentages above 30 % in shorter times. It was concluded that the <b>water-miscible</b> organic <b>solvents</b> severely perturbed the active site of the enzyme, thus denaturating the enzyme...|$|R
