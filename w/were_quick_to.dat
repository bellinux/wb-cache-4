5|$|American forces <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> {{counter the}} attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed {{the machine gun}} positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the musicians}} who <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt, and the {{influential}} singer Pauline Viardot, who all encouraged {{him in his}} career. In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.|$|E

Sir John Brocklebank offered Smallpeice a board position with the shipping line in December 1963, during Smallpeice's last meeting as a BOAC representative on the BOAC-Cunard board. Smallpeice initially refused to commit to the position, instead taking a three-month cruise from Hong Kong to London (with P).|$|E

5|$|Humphrey {{moved to}} his new home with an elderly couple in {{suburban}} London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced {{until the next day}} {{to reduce the risk of}} kidnap attempts. The Conservatives <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> point out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|The US military, who had green-jacketed rifle {{units in}} the Civil War, <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> follow the British, going khaki in the same year. Russia followed, partially, in 1908. The Italian Army used grigio-verde ("grey-green") in the Alps from 1906 and across the army from 1909. The Germans adopted feldgrau ("field grey") in 1910. By the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, France was the only major power to still field soldiers dressed in traditional conspicuous uniforms.|$|E

5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> draw attention to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed {{the remainder of the}} Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E
5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known species were {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} species were rare, and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. The species that had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 species that appeared in all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E

5|$|Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the {{influential}} Iroquois Confederacy {{did not participate}} in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> take action.|$|E
5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> identify it as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe rolling, and {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small turning radius, however, and <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 officers and 344 enlisted men, and later to 35 officers and 401 enlisted men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E

5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing {{the game in the}} same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquistadores {{were largely}} volunteers, {{receiving}} {{the spoils of}} victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The Spanish expeditions to Central America were launched from three different Spanish jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile Spanish captains. Spanish weaponry included swords, firearms, crossbows and light artillery. Metal armour was impractical in the hot, humid climate of Central America and the Spanish <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> adopt the quilted cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by {{a large number of}} Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups.|$|E
5|$|The watchmen <b>were</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> {{sound the}} alarm, {{but given the}} fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The wind blew from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E
