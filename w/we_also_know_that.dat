500|$|Gore's use of long ice core {{records of}} CO2 and {{temperature}} (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores {{to illustrate the}} correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and Michael E. Mann back up Gore's data. [...] "Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they 'fit'. Both of these statements are true," [...] said Schmidt and Mann. [...] "The complexity though is actually quite fascinating...a full understanding of why CO2 changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive, but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received solar radiation in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth‚Äôs orbital geometry warms the southern ocean, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect. Gore‚Äôs terse explanation of course does not mention such complexities, but the crux of his point‚Äìthat the observed long-term relationship between CO2 and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO2 concentrations‚Äìis correct. Moreover, our knowledge of why CO2 is changing now (fossil fuel burning) is solid. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that the carbon cycle feedback is positive (increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO2 and CH4), implying that future changes in CO2 will be larger than we might anticipate." [...] "Gore is careful not to state what the temperature/CO2 scaling is," [...] said Steig. [...] "He is making a qualitative point, which is entirely accurate. The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO2 changes. In that sense, the ice core CO2-temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO2 on climate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{source for the}} history of the Suevi during the 5th century is the chronicle written by the native bishop Hydatius in 470, as a continuation of the Chronicle of Saint Jerome. Hydatius was born circa 400, in the city of the Limici, straddling the southern borders of modern-day Galicia, on the valley of the Limia river. He witnessed the 409 settlement of the Suevi peoples in the Iberian Peninsula, and Galicia's transformation from Roman province into an independent barbarian kingdom. Through much of his life he was forced to stay in isolated Roman communities, constantly threatened by the Suevi and Vandals, though <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he travelled on several occasions outside of Hispania, for learning or as ambassador, and that he maintained correspondence with other bishops. In 460 he was captured by the Suevic warlord Frumarius, accused of treason by other local men. After being held captive for three months, as the Suevi ravaged the region of Chaves, he was then released unharmed, against the will of the men who had accused him. Hydatius' chronicle, whilst purporting to be universal, slowly turns into a local history. Following the barbarian settlements, he relates the conflict among the diverse nations; later, he also narrates the frequent conflict of the Sueves with the local, barely romanized, Galicians; the decline of the Roman powers in Hispania; the expansion of the Suevi into the south and the east; their defeat at the hands of Visigoths and other Roman foederati forces; and the posterior reconstitution of their kingdom under Remismund, together with their conversion to Arianism. While he is considered a great historian, his portraits are usually obscure, without any real reason or direction given to the decisions or movement of the Suevi, by mentioning what the Suevi did, but rarely what they said, or what they pretended. So Hydatius's image of the Suevi is from the outside, as lawless marauders. This description of the Suevi has bled into secondary sources: E.A. Thomson, an expert who has written many pieces on the subject, stated, ‚Äúthey just lash out blindly from year to year at any place that they suspected would supply them with food, valuables or money.‚Äù ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first half}} of the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] must now be {{accounted}} for down to [...] "placatus accipias". This first half is a reduplication of the prayer [...] "Quam oblationem". Both contain exactly the same idea that God may graciously accept our offering. [...] "Hanc oblationem" [...] and [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] differ only in the relative construction of the second form. We know that the relative construction is not the original one. In the [...] "De Sacramentis", to which reference has several times been made, the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] occurs as an absolute sentence: [...] "Fac nobis hanc oblationem adscriptam, rationabilem acceptabilemque, quod est figura corporis et sanguinis Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (IV, v). <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Igitur" [...] in [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] is not original. The parallel passages in Serapion and St. Mark's Liturgy have simply tauter ten thysian (Drews, 16). Moreover, the place and object of this prayer have varied very much. It has been applied to all sorts of purposes, and it is significant that it occurs specially often in connection with the dead (Ebner, Miss. Rom., 412). This would be a natural result, if we suppose it to be a compilation of two separate parts, both of which have lost their natural place in the Canon. Drews then proposes to supply the first words of the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] that we have put in the first place of his reconstructed Canon (see above), by the {{first half of}} the [...] "Hanc igitur", so that (leaving out the igitur) the Canon would once have begun: [...] "Hanc oblationem servitutis nostr√¶, sed et cunct√¶ famili√¶ tu√¶, qu√¶sumus Domine, ut placatus accipias ut in omnibus benedictam, adscriptam, ratam, rationabilemque facere digneris, ut nobis corpus et sanguis fiat dilectissimi filii tui Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (Drews, 30), and so on, according to the order suggested above. One word, [...] "ut", has been added to this compilation, to connect the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] with the continuation of [...] "Quam oblationem". This word is vouched for by the Greek version, which has ina here (Swainson, 197). Drews further notes that such a change in the arrangement of the Canon is not inconceivable. Popes have modified its order on other occasions. Joannes Diaconus, the biographer of St. Gregory I, tells us that he re-arranged a few parts of the Canon ("pauca convertens", Vita Greg., II, xvii).|$|E
