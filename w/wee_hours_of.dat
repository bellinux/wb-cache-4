It {{is celebrated}} on any Tuesday of Shravana and involves the worship of lingam, a gathering of womenfolk and narrating limericks or Ukhane using their husbands' first name. The women may also play traditional games such as Jhimma, and Fugadi, or more contemporary activities such as Bhendya till the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the next morning.|$|E
25|$|It {{was all for}} naught. By then, Nwe as well as Ngan-Mohn {{had come}} to {{consider}} Maha Dewi as the enemy, believing that she would put her lover on the throne instead. Zeik-Bye had been instigating; he had warned Nwe that Maha Dewi and Maru were plotting to arrest him. By 22 April 1383, Nwe had decided to revolt. In the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 5 May 1383, Nwe and his 30 men fled to Dagon, and seized the governor's residence at Dagon.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Burr {{took on a}} {{different}} kind of role, as Bacchus II, king of the Mardi Gras Krewe of the same name in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bacchus' parade rolls through the streets of New Orleans on the Sunday night before Mardi Gras Day. Burr threw the traditional beads and doubloons to the crowds, and following the parade he reigned at the Krewe's annual invitation-only ball (Bacchus calls it their Rendezvous) at the Rivergate Convention Center in downtown New Orleans. There, an invited crowd of over 10,000 greeted King Bacchus II {{and the rest of the}} parade as it rolled within the Center, with Burr again throwing more beads and doubloons. The festivities of that day began in the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the morning and continued to the end of the Ball, around 5 am the next morning.|$|E
25|$|The Gujarat {{government}} had faced strong criticism by {{human rights groups}} for anti-Muslim human rights violations, following the communal riots of 2002. During this period, there had been several police encounter deaths in the Gujarat, three {{of which have been}} attributed to attempts to kill Narendra Modi in retaliation for the alleged involvement of the state machinery in the riots. Some human rights activists have alleged that many of these alleged encounters actually happen in police custody. They claimed that there is a pattern that many of these encounters followed: they always took place in the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the morning in a deserted area, with no witnesses; a vigorous exchange of fire resulted in the deaths of all the terrorists, while the police received no injuries; and the diary of the accused was often recovered, and contained incriminating evidence. In 2007, several of the policemen held {{responsible for the death of}} Ishrat faced trial in connection with the 2005 fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife. The police officer D.G. Vanzara, who led the encounter was later jailed for his involvement in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter. This resulted in an investigation into the encounter involving Ishrat.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Albee {{acknowledged}} that he based the characters of Martha and George on his good friends, New York socialites Willard Maas and Marie Menken. [...] Maas was a professor of literature at Wagner College (one similarity between the character George and Willard) and his wife Marie was an experimental filmmaker and painter. Maas and Menken were known for their infamous salons, where drinking would [...] "commence at 4pm on Friday and end in the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> night on Monday" [...] (according to Gerard Malanga, a Warhol associate and friend to Maas). The primary conflict between George and Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? derived from Maas and Menken's tempestuous and volatile relationship.|$|E
2500|$|During Union General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, Confederate troops under General George E. Pickett fought Union troops near Milford. Just as the Civil War was {{concluding}} in April 1865, President Lincoln {{was assassinated}} in Washington, DC {{as part of a}} conspiracy to kill the leaders of the United States. As the conspirators fled, a manhunt was launched. After 10 days, in the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> April 26, federal troops tracked down John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's [...] assassin, and fellow conspirator David E. Herold at Garrett's farm about 3 miles west of Port Royal. Booth was fatally shot during their capture by federal troops. Herold was returned to Washington, where he was executed by hanging with 3 co-conspirators on July 7, 1865.|$|E

2500|$|Russell {{attempts}} {{to highlight the}} cynical view of many Germans towards the Nazi r√©gime. In particular, he focusses on the popular views of key Nazi figures - including Hermann Goering ("When Goering appears on the movie screen...Berlin audiences usually snigger."), Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Julius Streicher ("...has committed so many crimes and stolen so much money from the Party that even the Nazis could not cover up his crimes any longer") and Hans Kerrl ("...a gay old rascal frequently seen in Berlin dives until the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the morning"). Above all, Joseph Goebbels (whom Russell describes as [...] "...the most hated man in Germany...") is seen to elicit the most hatred. [...] "In three years spent in Germany," [...] Russell wrote [...] "I have never heard one kind word spoken on his behalf." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 Stone {{founded the}} World Studio Group (WSG) {{for the purpose}} of {{bringing}} together major recording studios around the world in order to provide premium recording services to major groups while on tour. [...] World Studio Group was chosen by Larry Hamby of A Records who proposed Stone's involvement with Woodstock '94. [...] Stone arranged for four remote recording trucks, two for each stage, at Woodstock '94, as a safety backup in case something went wrong. Bearsville Studios would serve as the hub of recording. Bob Clearmountain was chosen as chief audio engineer to tie the four parts together, and to mix the resulting album. Stone arranged to have a tour bus parked between the two stages for as many as 12 audio engineers to sleep. After Peter Gabriel's concluding set ended in the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> Monday, August 15, 1994, Stone's plan was carried out: all of the performances were digitally copied and backed up in the next two days. Not one song was lost.|$|E

6000|$|But it {{was hard}} work at first. She could get through the days easily enough by {{wandering}} {{in the woods and}} taking long walks along the rugged country roads; but in the evenings came the insistent call of the cafes, the cheap orchestras, vaudeville, midnight suppers and the like. She strenuously fought this yearning and found it was growing less and less powerful to influence her. But her nights were yet restless and her nerves throbbing from the effects of past dissipations. Often she would find herself unable to sleep and would go out into the moonlight when all others were in bed, and [...] "prowl around with the cats," [...] as she expressed it, until the <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> morning. Often she told Patsy she wished there was more work she could do. The drawings required by the paper never occupied her {{more than a couple of}} hours each day. Sometimes she made one of her cleverest cartoons in fifteen or twenty minutes.|$|E
