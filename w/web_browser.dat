With the increas-ing popularity of the <b>web</b> <b>browsers,</b> the modern <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> are designed to contain more features as compared to the exist-ing <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> For the transferring of information through these browsers, various protocols have been implemented on these modern <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> to make these browsers more efficient. Different protocols used in different layers have different functions and by increasing the efficiency of these protocols we can make the working of browsers more efficient...|$|R

5|$|While some promote Epiphany as {{the default}} <b>web</b> <b>browser</b> in Linux {{distributions}} with GNOME as the default desktop environment, most distros offer Firefox instead. In most minimalist distributions, Epiphany is installed with the GNOME meta-package or packages group.|$|E

5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used <b>web</b> <b>browser</b> at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E

The game had been developed by FreeStyleGames, sometime {{after the release of}} DJ Hero 2, with the main development duties passed to Virtual Fairground, using their platform The Ride, an Adobe Flash-based platform that would let the game be played in a <b>web</b> <b>browser.</b> The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects.|$|E

Debian is a popular choice for web servers (cf. LAMP).|$|E

In April 2011, James Zern, a YouTube software engineer, revealed that 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.

50|$|<b>Web</b> <b>browsers</b> offer a {{convenient}} alternative for many applications. <b>Web</b> <b>browsers</b> utilise HTML as a presentation layer for applications hosted on a central server, and <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> {{are available for}} pretty much every platform.

Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default <b>web</b> <b>browser,</b> and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of Microsoft Office, is the default office suite.|$|E
5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) testbed <b>Web</b> <b>browser</b> and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular {{at the beginning of}} the World Wide Web.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{milestone}} (after version 1.0) in Epiphany development was the 2.14 release. This {{was the first}} Epiphany release which followed GNOME's version numbering. It also featured network awareness using NetworkManager, smart bookmarks-related improvements {{and the possibility of}} being compiled against XULRunner. The latter was critical, as previously Epiphany could only use Firefox or Mozilla/SeaMonkey as a layout engine provider, so it could only be installed alongside one of those browsers. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the sole <b>web</b> <b>browser</b> on the system.|$|E

To increase the objectivity the thesis uses WRL method that shows which <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> are most appropriate for average user...|$|R
40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>browsers</b> are {{the primary}} {{interface}} for accessing {{the information on the}} World Wide Web. This work examines the relative vulnerability of <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> More specifically, this work explores the use of WIN 32 DLLs and API calls and how the modification of the return values and out parameters of the dangerous APIs affects browser. Results suggest that the APIs and DLLs used by the four <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> (Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape Navigator, and Internet Explorer) are similar with few exceptions. None of the more rarely used APIs have been specifically used by attackers to exploit security holes in the <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> The modification of return values and out parameters definitely affects the performance of the <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> and in some cases crashes the <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> Recommendations for developers include using secure functions, verification of the returned values and out parameters, proper bounds checking for buffer overflow, and more informative error messages. Each of these improvements would make browsers more usable and less vulnerable. Most importantly, this comparative study will help users make informed decisions about which browser to use based on relative performance in terms of security vulnerabilities rather than simple popularity. 1...|$|R

PHP treats newlines as whitespace {{in the manner of}} a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a <b>web</b> <b>browser.</b>|$|E

His experience (from gaming in his youth) impressed on him the importance of networking. Wales was interested in computer science, experimenting with source code on the Internet and improving his skill at computer programming. In his spare time after work at Chicago Options Associates, Wales constructed his own <b>web</b> <b>browser.</b> While at the firm, he noted the successful 1995 initial public offering of Netscape Communications.|$|E
5|$|Windows 95 was {{released}} without a <b>web</b> <b>browser</b> as Microsoft {{had not yet}} developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their browser as Internet Explorer. Spyglass went on to later dispute {{the terms of the}} agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.|$|E
40|$|Activity-Based Computing (ABC) {{is a way}} {{working with}} {{computers}} based on activites rather than just applications and documents. This thesis covers the use of Activity-Based Computing concepts in current software products. Several groups of software products have been analyzed in a product analysis, including cloud computing services and <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> This analysis reveals that most products have functionality similar {{to some of the}} ABC concepts. It also shows that some product groups includes more ABC concepts than others, and different products have similarities with different ABC concepts. Suggestions for improvements to enable ABC in <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> and cloud computing services are also included in this thesis. A concept development approach have been used to propose possible solutions and improvements to <b>web</b> <b>browsers.</b> <b>Web</b> <b>browsers</b> are a good starting point for implementing ABC for use with cloud services and web applications.
