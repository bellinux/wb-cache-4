50|$|Tiddlywinks is a {{competitive}} game involving four colours of winks. Each player controls the winks of a colour, the colours being blue, green, red and yellow. Red and blue are always partners against green and yellow. There are six winks of each colour, which begin {{the game in}} the corners of a felt mat measuring 6 feet by 3 feet. This mat is ordinarily placed on a table, and a pot is placed at its centre. There are two primary methods of play with the four colors of winks: a pairs game, and a singles game. The pairs game involves four players, playing in partnerships, with each <b>winker</b> playing a single color. The singles game involves a single <b>winker</b> playing against another single <b>winker,</b> each playing two colors of winks in alternation.|$|E
