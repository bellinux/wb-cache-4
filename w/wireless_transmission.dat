The first transatlantic <b>wireless</b> <b>transmission</b> was received here by Guglielmo Marconi on 12 December 1901. Today, Signal Hill is a National Historic Site of Canada and remains incredibly popular amongst tourists and locals alike; 97% of all tourists to St. John's visit Signal Hill. Amongst its popular attractions are the Signal Hill Tattoo, showcasing the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of foot, c. 1795, and the North Head Trail which grants an impressive view of the Atlantic Ocean and the surrounding coast.|$|E
5|$|Brean Down is a {{promontory}} {{marking the}} eastern end of the bay. Made of carboniferous limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills, and two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. It is owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology, as well as being a Site of Special Scientific Interest in its own right. It is bounded by steep cliffs and, at its seaward point, Brean Down Fort built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. There is evidence of an Iron Age hill fort, prehistoric barrows, field systems and a pagan shrine. The shrine dating from pre-Roman times was re-established as a Romano-Celtic style temple in the mid-4th century and probably succeeded by a small late-4th century Christian oratory. In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales to Flat Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved his equipment to Brean Down and set a new distance record for <b>wireless</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

A similar station had been set up at Bournemouth, some fourteen miles away. Afterwards Evan-Thomas wrote to Vice-Admiral sir Compton Domville, chairman of the signals committee, reporting the success of the experiment, and recommending a trial on board two warships. The battleship HMS Alexandra and cruisers HMS Europa and HMS Juno were each equipped with radios for the 1899 manoeuvres, and transmitted messages up to 60 miles.|$|E
25|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) {{services were}} introduced in 1927, allowing messages to penetrate globally. The most important use was reaching fishing vessels in the Antarctic and increased the use of private telegrams by seamen. Implementation was slow: by 1935 HF transmitters had been installed on about 100 Norwegian ships, and 450 ships by 1940. Wireless telephony was introduced at Bergen Radio in 1931 and by 1939 the service covered the entire coast. In 1940 there were 70 communities which had their telephone network connected to the national network by <b>wireless</b> <b>transmission.</b> From 1927 new spark-gap transmitters over 300watts were not permitted and all such transmitters had to be phased out by 1940.

40|$|Area {{spectral}} efficiency (ASE) was introduced as a metric {{to quantify the}} spectral utilization efficiency of cellular systems.

In this paper, we generalize the concept of ASE to study arbitrary <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Specifically, we introduce the notion of affected area to characterize the spatial property of arbitrary <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Based on the definition of affected area, we define the performance metric, generalized area {{spectral efficiency}} (GASE), to quantify the spatial spectral utilization efficiency as well as the greenness of <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions.</b> After illustrating its evaluation for point-to-point transmission, we analyze the GASE performance of several different transmission scenarios, including dual-hop relay transmission, three-node cooperative relay transmission and underlay cognitive radio transmission. We derive closed-form expressions for the GASE metric of each transmission scenario under Rayleigh fading environment whenever possible. Through mathematical analysis and numerical examples, we show that the GASE metric provides a new perspective on the design and optimization of <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions,</b> especially on the transmitting power selection. We also show that introducing relay nodes can greatly improve the spatial utilization efficiency of wireless systems. We illustrate that the GASE metric can help optimize the deployment of underlay cognitive radio systems. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted by TCo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The use {{of signal}} {{processing}} techniques to protect <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions</b> is proposed {{as a way}} to secure wireless networks at the physical layer. This approach addresses a unique weakness of wireless networks whereby network traffic traverses a public wireless medium making traditional boundary controls ineffective. Specifically, a randomized array transmission scheme is developed to guarantee <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions</b> with inherent low-probabilityof-interception (LPI). In contrast to conventional spread spectrum or data encryption techniques, this new method exploits the redundancy of transmit antenna arrays for deliberate signal randomization which, when combined with channel diversity, effectively randomizes the eavesdropper’s signals but not the authorized receiver’s signals. The LPI of this transmission scheme is analyzed via proving the indeterminacy of the eavesdropper’s blind deconvolution. Extensive simulations and some preliminary experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed method is useful for securing <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions,</b> or for supporting upper-layer key management protocols.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions</b> into the da-ta center {{has been shown}} to be promising in improving the performance of data center networks (DCN) cost ef-fectively. For high transmission flexibility and perfor-mance, a fundamental challenge is to increase the wire-less availability and enable fully hybrid and seamless transmissions over both wired and wireless DCN com-ponents. Rather than limiting the number of wireless ra-dios by the size of top-of-rack (ToR) switches, we pro-pose a novel DCN architecture, Diamond, which nests the wired DCN with radios equipped on all servers. To harvest the gain allowed by the rich reconfigurable wire-less resources, we propose the low-cost deployment of scalable 3 D Ring Reflection Spaces (RRSs) which are in-terconnected with streamlined wired herringbone to en-able large number of concurrent <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions</b> through high-performance multi-reflection of radio sig-nals over metal. To increase the number of concurrent <b>wireless</b> <b>transmissions</b> within each RRS, we propose a precise reflection method to reduce the wireless interfer-ence.
