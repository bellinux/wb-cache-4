If they cannot find the materials, the dwarf will wait at the workshop, demanding it until it is available. After a few in-game weeks, the <b>work</b> <b>results</b> in a legendary artifact, an item so masterfully crafted that it is usually worth more than a beginning fortress' total wealth put together. These artifacts {{will be added to}} the world's records and its exact description can be viewed. Through this entire period of being in a strange mood, a dwarf will not eat, drink or sleep and will eventually go insane if prolonged due to any reason.|$|E
2500|$|As {{is typical}} of rail transit in the United States, MARTA's rail lines have two {{parallel}} tracks. Any train failure or track <b>work</b> <b>results</b> in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite directions, a situation known as single-tracking. There are no plans {{at this time to}} expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. [...] Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement single-tracking on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less-frequent service.|$|E

40|$|A classic problem {{faced by}} the {{management}} of sharia financial institutions, in this case Baitul Mal Wat Tamwil (BMT), has been being still the same from year to year, namely the limitation of human resources in term of quality, including their internal auditors. An internal auditor is able to influence the performance of sharia financial institutions whether it is good or bad, because an internal auditor is responsible for providing analysis, information, financial evaluation services, even for giving recommendations to the management. The goals of this research are (1) to find out the characteristics of the variables of the research, namely: internal auditor’s personality, internal auditor’s professionalism, internal auditor’s <b>work</b> <b>result,</b> and sharia financial institution’s performance. The result of the research demonstrates that (1) as regards the variable of internal auditor’s personality, formal education indicator could not explain internal auditor’s personality, as regards the variable of internal auditor’s professionalism, professional social responsibility indicator was the strongest indicator in explaining internal auditor’s professionalism, as regards internal auditor’s <b>work</b> <b>result,</b> management’s commitment indicator is the strongest indicator in explaining internal auditor’s <b>work</b> <b>result,</b> and as regards sharia financial institution’s (BMT)  performance variable, capital structure and efficiency is two strongest indicators in explaining sharia financial institution’s (BMT) performance, and (2) internal auditor’s personality, internal auditor’s professionalism, internal auditor’s <b>work</b> <b>result,</b> and sharia financial institution’s performance has a positive and significant correlation, which mean that the better the auditor internal’s personality the more professional the internal auditor, the more professional the internal auditor the better the <b>work</b> <b>result,</b> the better the <b>work</b> <b>result</b> the better sharia financial institution’s (BMT) performance...|$|R

2500|$|Madoff's name {{first came}} up in a fraud {{investigation}} in 1992, when two people complained to the SEC about investments they made with a firm called Avellino & Bienes. Avellino returned the money to investors and the SEC closed the case. In 2004, Genevievette Walker-Lightfoot, a lawyer in the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), informed her supervisor branch chief Mark Donohue that her review of Madoff found numerous inconsistencies, and recommended further questioning. However, she was told by Donohue and his boss Eric Swanson to stop work on the Madoff investigation, send them her <b>work</b> <b>results,</b> and instead investigate the mutual fund industry. Swanson, Assistant Director of the SEC's OCIE, had met Shana Madoff in 2003 while investigating her uncle Bernie Madoff and his firm. The investigation was concluded in 2005. In 2006 Swanson left the SEC and became engaged to Shana Madoff, and in 2007 the two married. A spokesman for Swanson said he [...] "did not participate in any inquiry of Bernard Madoff Securities or its affiliates while involved in a relationship" [...] with Shana Madoff.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{understanding}} these white devils. Ah Cho pondered their inscrutableness {{as he sat}} in the court room waiting the judgment. There was no telling what went on at the back of their minds. He had seen a few of the white devils. They were all alike--the officers and sailors on the ship, the French officials, the several white men on the plantation, including Schemmer. Their minds all moved in mysterious ways there was no getting at. They grew angry without apparent cause, and their anger was always dangerous. They were like wild beasts at such times. They worried about little things, and on occasion could out-toil even a Chinago. They were not temperate as Chinagos were temperate; they were gluttons, eating prodigiously and drinking more prodigiously. A Chinago never knew when an act would please them or arouse a storm of wrath. A Chinago could never tell. What pleased one time, the very next time might provoke an outburst of anger. There was a curtain behind the eyes of the white devils that screened the backs of their minds from the Chinago's gaze. And then, on top of it all, was that terrible efficiency of the white devils, that ability to do things, to make things go, to <b>work</b> <b>results,</b> to bend to their wills all creeping, crawling things, and the powers of the very elements themselves. Yes, the white men were strange and wonderful, and they were devils. Look at Schemmer.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} was as fine as the {{arrangement}} could possibly require. As the sun passed the meridian and declined westward, the tall shadows from the scaffold-poles of Barnet's rising residence streaked the ground {{as far as to}} the middle of the highway. Barnet himself was there inspecting the progress of the works for the first time during several weeks. A building in an old-fashioned town five-and-thirty years ago did not, as in the modern fashion, rise from the sod like a booth at a fair. The foundations and lower courses were put in and allowed to settle for many weeks before the superstructure was built up, and a whole summer of drying was hardly sufficient to do justice to the important issues involved. Barnet stood within a window-niche which had as yet received no frame, and thence looked down a slope into the road. The wheels of a chaise were heard, and then his handsome Xantippe, in the company of Mrs. Downe, drove past on their way to the shore. They were driving slowly; there was a pleasing light in Mrs. Downe's face, which seemed faintly to reflect itself upon the countenance of her companion--that politesse du coeur which was so natural to her having possibly begun already to <b>work</b> <b>results.</b> But whatever the situation, Barnet resolved not to interfere, or do anything to hazard the promise of the day. He might well afford to trust the issue to another when he could never direct it but to ill himself. His wife's clenched rein-hand in its lemon-coloured glove, her stiff erect figure, clad in velvet and lace, and her boldly-outlined face, passed on, exhibiting their owner as one fixed for ever above the level of her companion--socially by her early breeding, and materially by her higher cushion.|$|E

60|$|Now, it is {{necessary}} here very carefully to distinguish between that character of the work which depends on {{the imagination of the}} beholder, and that which results from the imagination of the artist, for a work is often called imaginative when it merely leaves room for the action of the imagination; whereas though nearly all imaginative works do this, yet it may be done also by works that have in them no imagination at all. A few shapeless scratches or accidental stains on a wall; or the forms of clouds, or any other complicated accidents, will set the imagination to work to coin something out of them, and all paintings in which there is much gloom or mystery, possess therein a certain sublimity owing to the play given to the beholder's imagination, without, necessarily, being in the slightest degree imaginative themselves. The vacancy of a truly imaginative <b>work</b> <b>results</b> not from absence of ideas, or incapability of grasping and detailing them, but from the painter having told the whole pith and power of his subject and disdaining to tell more, and the sign of this being the case is, that the imagination of the beholder is forced to act in a certain mode, and feels itself overpowered and borne away by that of the painter, and not able to defend itself, nor go which way it will, and the value of the work depends on the truth, authority, and inevitability of this suggestiveness, and on the absolute right choice of the critical moment. Now observe in this work of Turner's, that the whole value of it depends on the character of curve assumed by the serpent's body; for had it been a mere semicircle, or gone down in a series of smaller coils, it {{would have been in the}} first case, ridiculous, as false and unlike a serpent, and in the second, disgusting, nothing more than an exaggerated viper, but it is that coming straight at the right hand which suggests the drawing forth of an enormous weight, and gives the bent part its springing look, that frightens us. Again, remove the light trunk[60] on the left, and observe how useless all the gloom of the picture would have been, if this trunk had not given it depth and hollowness. Finally and chiefly, observe that the painter is not satisfied even with all the suggestiveness thus obtained, but to make sure of us, and force us, whether we will or no, to walk his way, and not ours, the trunks of the trees on the right are all cloven into yawning and writhing heads and bodies, and alive with dragon energy all about us, note especially the nearest with its gaping jaws and claw-like branch at the seeming shoulder; a kind of suggestion which in itself is not imaginative, but merely fanciful, (using the term fancy in that third sense not yet explained, corresponding to the third office of imagination;) but it is imaginative in its present use and application, for the painter addresses thereby that morbid and fearful condition of mind which he has endeavored to excite in the spectator, and which in reality would have seen in every trunk and bough, as it penetrated into the deeper thicket, the object of its terror.|$|E
