500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jordan McGraw {{described}} {{the formation of}} Stars in Stereo in detail {{in an interview with}} Rock Revolt Magazine. Before that date (June 6, 2011), the other four dudes in the band had been making music in another band (City (Comma) State) and we decided to take that apart. It wasn't exactly what we wanted, so <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write individually. <b>We</b> were still friends and still hanging out and <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> hear each others stuff and it sounded similar. We decided that everyone was a good fit <b>to</b> <b>start</b> on another project and <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> search for a voice, a front woman. We found Bec and she was absolutely perfect. Literally, two days after we met, we went into the studio and started writing music together and doing the whole thing.|$|R

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera. This way I can let [...] know if any extra coverage is needed", he explained. [...] "Often I’ll get word to the 1st [...] and he’ll sneak in extra shots if the schedule permits. Although I will have a first assembly when the production wraps, Peter will never sit though a complete viewing of that. He works in a very linear manner, so as <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we’ll stop and address it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sanz {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence. His song [...] "Sí, He Cantado Mal" [...] (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from No Es lo Mismo references this, with Sanz saying [...] "I'm laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things. Sometimes, I'm harder on myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that." [...] Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a [...] "heavy metal radical". He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where [...] "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing. When the family comes together <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> sing. In a way it's not just music, it's culture." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114. In the team meeting the next day, Schembechler {{walked into the}} room and wrote [...] "Ed Muransky" [...] and [...] "Stan Edwards" [...] on the chalkboard, and then barked out, [...] "The rest of you are quitters. I want nothing more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with 100PercentRock.com, Yamano explained that her process for writing and recording has not changed substantially from the band's early days: [...] "I’m lazy and I don’t start writing songs until we book recording studio , but once we booked the studio, I can write songs quickly with concentration. Then I send my demo to our members and we rehearse. At the recording studio, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> record from basic tracks then overdub." [...] On this album, {{every member of the}} band also sings a unique song about a food item; Yamano sings [...] "Fortune Cookie", the band's bassist Ritsuko Taneda lends her vocals to [...] "Ramen Rock", and drummer Emi Morimoto can be heard on [...] "Green Tea". The first song was inspired by Yamano fondness for eating a fortune cookie after a meal of Chinese food in America; after learning that the cookies were actually invented in Japan, Yamano decided to pen the song. [...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show. Finally, Yamano asked Morimoto to sing [...] "Green Tea" [...] because she is from Kyoto, which is known for its green tea.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well-received, with a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in [...] Entertainment Weekly rating it a B+, describing it as [...] "A very cool-looking episode that does the best job so far of illuminating the agents' position with relation to the government [...] "; also noting the character of Max Fenig as a precursor to those of The Lone Gunmen. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, also rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a strong entry", finding that it served as a [...] "slow reveal" [...] of the series' [...] themes. Phipps also noted the importance of Max Fenig {{as a sign of}} [...] "the human toll exacted by all the dark goings on" [...] in the series, claiming that [...] "without Max we just get Mulder and Scully chasing a mysterious downed object and coming up empty-handed. With Max, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> realize the stakes for which they're playing". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "a mundane forty minutes" [...] that [...] "really fails to impress", and noting that the plot follows [...] "more or less the same pattern", as the series' previous mythology episodes. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Shearman described [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] as having been produced [...] "with style and wit", feeling that it featured a relatively static plot but was nevertheless entertaining. He found Duchovny's performance in the episode, and its final scene featuring Deep Throat's ambiguous motivations, to have been the highlights of an episode otherwise filled with [...] "smoke and mirrors"; comparing it to the earlier episode [...] "Conduit" [...] in this regard.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the close}} of the band's tour in support of Light Grenades (2006), the band entered an {{extended}} hiatus. Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like." [...] Bassist Ben Kenney stated, [...] "Being with music is a creative thing and requires a certain amount of creativity - to just keep going back to that well over and over again, it doesn’t have a chance to replenish." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Paesano {{sought out}} the {{composer}} role for the first Marvel/Netflix series, Daredevil, after he had previously worked with showrunner Steven S. DeKnight on a proof of concept. After successfully auditioning for the job, Paesano joined the series several weeks into post-production, and had to provide around 25–30 minutes of music per episode. He averaged [...] "around an episode every four or five days". DeKnight [...] "had a very clear vision of what he wanted. He wanted to really keep the show grounded {{and he wanted to}} make it feel real and not so fantastical like some of the other Marvel properties were. He wanted music you could feel and not necessarily hear. We cut the score to be minimalistic." [...] Once Daredevil gets his superhero costume {{at the end of the}} first season, [...] "the music starts to change color and <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> get more in to that Marvel universe." [...] Due to his schedule and the style of the score, Paesano ultimately used mostly electronic sounds and music, but did try to add acoustic instruments, such as cellos, where possible to have more of a hybrid sound, often using these in non-traditional ways. Instead of more traditional percussion, Paesano used a low pulse throughout the series, emulating a heartbeat since the titular character often listens to people's heartbeats with his heightened senses. Paesano took inspiration from James Newton Howard's Michael Clayton score for the series' lawyer-oriented scenes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sha'n't forget it," [...] Ruthven said quietly, {{and they}} {{stood for a}} few minutes without speaking. [...] "Now, what had we better do? Shall <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> run home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{must have}} been before <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> look for you," [...] {{returned}} Dave. [...] "After this {{you want to be}} careful how you climb around. Some of the rocks are loose and very treacherous." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I should {{prefer not}} to have {{quantities}} mentioned," [...] Harrison interrupted. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> sell in a dozen places, the thing is beyond exact calculation. The brake can be put on if necessary." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> {{cross the}} road. An open {{carriage}} drives by, {{and we see}} a jaded, red-haired woman, smeared with paint, dressed in furs, and petulantly discontented. Her face is familiar to me, her face, with a difference.|$|E

30|$|Materials and methods: <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> perform DaVinci®-Robot-assisted surgery since June 2007.

30|$|After that, <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> {{experiment}} with the full SADF solution. As previously mentioned, the biggest overhead of SADF {{is related to the}} vulnerability analysis.
