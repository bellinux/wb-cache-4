5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Grant {{began the}} second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden, {{in which he}} {{discussed}} {{some of his own}} personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time, and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge <b>with</b> <b>Blond</b> and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with an}} open shot of an {{airplane}} flying surrounded by many doves, referencing the works of Hong Kong director John Woo. Spears appears <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair dressed as a flight attendant, receiving a phone call. After serving some of the passengers, she leads a middle aged overweight man {{to the bathroom and}} seduces him. She peels off the man's mask to reveal an attractive man (Matthew Felker) hiding underneath it and steals a black pass from his pocket when they resume kissing. Spears is then dropped {{into the back of a}} Ducati 999, driven by a shirtless male (Tyson Beckford) in a futuristic Paris, that was compared to the 1982 film Blade Runner. She wears a tight black catsuit and sports red hair, inspired by the character of Sydney Bristow from television series Alias. They pass a woman and lift up her dress, a homage to the iconic Marilyn Monroe scene in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. They also pass two women frolicking in a store window.|$|E

25|$|During the superhero {{revival of}} the 1960s, Archie Comics {{published}} an eight-issue series, The Shadow (Aug. 1964 - Sept. 1965), under the company's Mighty Comics imprint. In the first issue, The Shadow was loosely based on the radio version, but <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair. In issue #2 (Sept. 1964), the character {{was transformed into a}} campy, heavily muscled superhero in a green and blue costume by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger. Later issues of this eight-issue series were written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.|$|E
25|$|Early {{travelers}} to the Canary Islands had described the Guanche natives as having golden-blond hair and white skin, and mummies {{had been found}} <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> tresses—facts which Wirth believed indicated that the islands had once been inhabited by Nordics. His colleague Otto Huth proposed an autumn of 1939 expedition to study the ancient islanders’ racial origins, artifacts and religious rites. At the time, the Canary Islands were part of Francisco Franco’s Spanish State (Estado Español). Because Franco refused {{to side with the}} Axis when the war started, however, the trip was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 17th {{century to the}} middle 18th century, European colonists {{reported}} encounters with gray-eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists (although at least one, {{a story of a}} Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language, {{is likely to be a}} hoax). Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair and blue eyes not long after their arrival. As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement, and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora, the likelihood that the origin of those fair-skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high.|$|E
25|$|Schneerson was {{described}} as a slim boy <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair, and was gifted with extraordinary intelligence and empathy. During his youth, he received a private education and was tutored by Zalman Vilenkin from 1909 through 1913. When Schneerson was eleven years old, Vilenkin informed his father that he had nothing more to teach his son. At that point, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak began teaching his son Talmud and rabbinic literature, as well as Kabbalah. Schneerson proved gifted in both Talmudic and Kabalistic study and also took exams as an external student of the local Soviet school. He was considered an Illui and genius, {{and by the time he}} was seventeen, he had mastered the entire Talmud, some 5,894 pages, as well as all its early commentaries.|$|E
25|$|In the Superman Adventures comic line {{based on}} the TV series of the same name, Luthor's backstory is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Modern Age origin with slight changes. Luthor is shown originating in Suicide Slum, but at an early age already aware of how his brilliance outshone other children and his plans to have all Metropolis look up to him one day. Luthor's baldness is never explained, save for a brief depiction of him <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair in childhood, it is assumed the hair loss was natural. Luthor's parents die during his teenage years, however their deaths were indeed accidental and with no foul play by Lex. As in the usual story, Lex uses the insurance payouts to kick-start his future by paying for his tuition to MIT and eventually starting LexCorp. His hatred of Superman is explained as the citizens of Metropolis have had more admiration for the Man of Steel than for Lex.|$|E

Soon after, he became a recurring cast member on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family.

[...] "There is nothing better than a good lie," [...] Lee says cheerily, through a smile. Scenes of Lee in her hotel room follow as she removes her makeup. Those scenes are followed by Lee with [...] "luxurious auburn tresses and dangling diamond earrings" [...] as she plays a glamorous spokesmodel who violently scribbles and scratches out her picture in magazines after the photo shoot has finished.

500|$|In December 1828 Juan Lavalle, the Unitarian {{governor}} of Buenos Aires had Dorrego seized and executed without trial. With Dorrego gone, Rosas filled the vacant Federalist leadership and rebelled against the Unitarians. He allied with Estanislao López, caudillo and ruler of Santa Fe Province, and they defeated Lavalle at the Battle of Márquez Bridge in April 1829. When Rosas entered {{the city of}} Buenos Aires in November of that year, he was hailed both as a victorious military leader and {{as the head of}} the Federalists. Rosas was considered a handsome man, standing [...] tall <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair and [...] "piercing blue eyes". Charles Darwin, who met Rosas during the Beagle survey expedition, assessed him as [...] "a man of extraordinary character". British diplomat Henry Southern said that in [...] "appearance Rosas resembles an English gentleman farmer—his manners are courteous without being refined. He is affable and agreeable in conversation, which however nearly always turns on himself, but his tone is pleasant and agreeable enough. His memory is stupendous: and his accuracy in all points of detail never failing." ...|$|E

500|$|Introduced as a {{young man}} <b>with</b> <b>blond,</b> spiky hair, blue eyes and goggles, Naruto Uzumaki {{frequently}} wears an orange tracksuit. Following his ninja graduation he also wore a headband that denotes his position as a ninja from Konohagakure. In Part II of the manga, the now older and larger Naruto wears a different outfit. The [...] Nine-Tailed Demon Fox within influences his body, causing Naruto to resemble the Fox {{over the course of his}} battles. While Naruto only shows small changes such as sharp teeth and claws initially, he later develops a red tail made of the Fox's vital energy, or chakra. The red chakra starts by surrounding his body; once four tails are manifested, Naruto's blood begins to merge with the chakra, coloring his entire body red. As the sixth tail appears, Naruto appears to wear the Fox's skeleton, but once Naruto takes control of the fox's chakra, he is able to maintain his regular form while using it. As a ninja, Naruto carries many weapons, but relies mostly on his ninja techniques while fighting, specializing in making clones of himself. Nevertheless, late in the series Naruto starts wielding a pair of bō in combat.|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and <b>with</b> <b>blond</b> hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

2500|$|Kobolds {{who live}} in human homes are {{generally}} depicted as humanlike, dressed as peasants, and standing about as tall as a four-year-old child. A legend recorded by folklorist Joseph Snowe from a place called Alte Burg in 1839 tells of a creature [...] "in {{the shape of a}} short, thick-set being, neither boy nor man, but akin to the condition of both, garbed in a party-coloured loose surcoat, and wearing a high-crowned hat with a broad brim on his diminutive head." [...] The kobold Hödekin (also known as Hüdekin and Hütchen) of Hildesheim wore a little hat down over his face (Hödekin means [...] "little hat"). Another type of kobold known as the Hütchen is said to be [...] tall, with red hair and beard, and clad in red or green clothing and a red hat and may even be blind. [...] Yet other tales describe kobolds appearing as herdsmen looking for work and little, wrinkled old men in pointed hoods. [...] Some kobolds resemble small children. According to dramatist and novelist X. B. Saintine, kobolds are the spirits of dead children and often appear with a knife that represents the means by which they were put to death. Heinzelmann, a kobold from the folklore of Hudermühlen Castle in the region of Lüneburg, appeared as a beautiful boy <b>with</b> <b>blond,</b> curly hair to his shoulders and dressed in a red silk coat.
