Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest {{meal of the}} day. <b>Wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye</b> breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of bread and salt when greeting a guest or visitor.|$|E
5|$|John Slade was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy a crop of <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye</b> from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the case before the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; one of the Common Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed Slade money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye,</b> and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of foreign germplasm into crops {{has been achieved}} by traditional crop breeders by overcoming species barriers. A hybrid cereal grain was created in 1875, by crossing <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye.</b> Since then important traits including dwarfing genes and rust resistance have been introduced. Plant tissue culture and deliberate mutations have enabled humans to alter the makeup of plant genomes.|$|E
25|$|The new {{standards}} came about {{in part because}} of new sensitive and specific testing procedures. These procedures are capable of detecting wheat or multiple cereals at concentrations as low as 1 part per million (PPM or 1mg/kg). A new barley-sensitive ELISA called the R5 sandwich assay does not detect gluten in any of 25 pure oat varieties, but it does detect barley, <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye.</b>|$|E

25|$|Respiratory allergies are an {{occupational}} disease that develop in food service workers. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat; some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens.

25|$|Foods {{contribute}} {{virtually all}} of the copper consumed by humans. The best dietary sources include seafood (especially shellfish), organ meats (e.g., liver), whole grains, legumes (e.g., beans and lentils) and chocolate. Nuts, including peanuts and pecans, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye,</b> and several fruits including lemons and raisins. Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples). Tea, rice and chicken are relatively low in copper, but can provide a reasonable amount of copper when they are consumed in significant amounts.|$|E
500|$|Historically, Bradwall {{has been}} farming and pasture land with the {{majority}} of people working in agriculture. The 1881 Census notes that nearly 20% of the residents were in agriculture followed by nearly 12% in domestic service; 43% had an unknown, or non-specific occupation (see table below). The 1902 Kelly's Directory of Cheshire, noted that in Bradwall, [...] "the crops are oats, roots, <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye.</b> The land is chiefly pasture", and that commercially, there are a total of 15 farmers, one blacksmith and the superintendent of the Reformatory School.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including <b>wheat,</b> rice, oats, <b>and</b> <b>rye,</b> <b>and</b> less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like <b>wheat,</b> barley, <b>and</b> <b>rye.</b>|$|R

The barn and courtyard contain displays of farm machinery from the Victorian and early 20th century periods. Other exhibits show local crafts, including willow coppicing, mud horse fishing on the flats of Bridgwater Bay, peat digging on the Somerset Levels and the production of milk, cheese, and cider. In reconstructed rooms detailing domestic life in the nearby village of Butleigh, the story of one farm worker, John Hodges, is told from cradle to grave. Outside, there is a beehive and rare breeds of poultry and sheep in the cider apple orchard.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1750 and 1850, the English {{population}} nearly tripled, with {{an estimated}} increase from 5.7 million to 16.6 million, and all these people had to be fed from the domestic food supply. [...] This was achieved through intensified agriculture and land reclamation from the Fens, woodlands, and upland pastures. The crop mix changed too, with <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye</b> replacing barley. [...] Nitrogen fixing plants such as legumes led to sustainable increased yields. These increased yields, combined with improved farming machinery and then-new capitalist ways of organising labour, meant that increased crop production did not need much more manpower, which freed labour for non-agricultural work. [...] Indeed, by 1850 Britain had the smallest proportion of its population engaged in farming of {{any country in the}} world, at 22%.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resolution}} of these restrictions came shortly after 1585, {{when a new}} Court of Exchequer Chamber was established to hear common law appeals. In 1602, in Slade v Morley, a grain merchant named Slade claimed that Morley had agreed to buy <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>rye</b> for £16, but then had backed out. Actions for debt were in {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court of Common Pleas, which had required both (1) proof of a debt, and (2) a subsequent promise to repay the debt, so that a finding of deceit (for non-payment) could be made against a defendant. But if a claimant wanted to simply demand payment of the contractual debt (rather than a subsequent promise to pay) he could have to risk a wager of law. The judges of the Court of the King's Bench was prepared to allow [...] "assumpsit" [...] actions (for obligations being assumed) simply from proof of the original agreement. With a majority in the Exchquer Chamber, after six years Lord Popham CJ held that [...] "every contract importeth in itself an Assumpsit". Around the same time the Common Pleas indicated a different limit for contract enforcement in Bret v JS, that [...] "natural affection of itself is not a sufficient consideration to ground an assumpsit" [...] and {{there had to be some}} [...] "express quid pro quo". Now that wager of law, and sealed covenants were essentially unnecessary, the Statute of Frauds 1677 codified the contract types that were thought should still require some form. Over the late 17th and 18th centuries Sir John Holt, and then Lord Mansfield actively incorporated the principles of international trade law and custom into English common law as they saw it: principles of commercial certainty, good faith, fair dealing, and the enforceability of seriously intended promises. As Lord Mansfield held, [...] "Mercantile law is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations", and [...] "the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same".|$|E

50|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the mashed barley grains to form the wort) but also as a rich source of amylase, a digestive enzyme that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including <b>wheat,</b> rice, oats, <b>and</b> <b>rye,</b> <b>and,</b> less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used.
