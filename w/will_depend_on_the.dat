5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science.

5|$|Using this information, {{a plan of}} {{the optimal}} {{distribution}} of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> type of cancer being treated and {{the characteristics of the}} target tumour.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away {{from the side of}} damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{skills and abilities}} of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those {{who are unable to}} point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve {{to compensate for the}} varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value <b>will</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of}} his death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E
