5|$|East of the mall, {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> line. NY31 progresses onward into <b>Wayne</b> <b>County,</b> where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural town of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to exiting the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 through the center of the village.|$|E
5|$|I-275 {{begins at}} exit 20 along I-75 in northeastern Monroe County. The {{surrounding}} area is farmland and residential subdivisions {{in the adjacent}} Frenchtown and Berlin charter townships near the community of Newport. The freeway angles to the northwest and crosses US Highway 24 (US24), which is also called Telegraph Road. After this interchange, I-275 turns to the north, running east of Carleton, crossing the Canadian National Railway and Conrail Shared Assets lines north of exit5. At Will Carleton Road, the trunkline crosses into <b>Wayne</b> <b>County.</b> There it continues on a northerly path parallel to a CSX Transportation line through southern <b>Wayne</b> <b>County.</b> The freeway crosses the Huron River at South Huron Road, adjacent to Willow Metropark.|$|E
5|$|Like NY33 before it, NY441 officially {{ended at}} NY21 in Marion {{when it was}} first assigned. By 1970, the east end of the route was moved to NY350 in Walworth. The change in NY441's {{alignment}} had no effect on the maintenance of the Walworth–Marion highway, however, as the <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> portion of NY441 was entirely county-maintained. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from the Monroe County line to NY350 was transferred from <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end.|$|E

5|$|Ford Road {{has been}} a part of the state highway system since December 3, 1930. Since the state has {{maintained}} the roadway as M-153, it has been extended westward from <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> into Washtenaw County and upgraded in sections to expressway conditions. The first of these improvements were made in the 1930s with additional upgrades in the 1960s and 1970s. The last change was made by 1980 to create the modern routing.|$|E

Elizabeth Lummis attended Aurora Female Seminary in Aurora, New York, where she studied, among other subjects, French, German and Italian. Her first published work, at age 16, was a translation of Silvio Pellico's Euphemio of Messina.|$|E
5|$|Named for an English {{immigrant}} to the area, Davison Avenue {{was originally}} the only street connecting across Highland Park to Detroit. It was rebuilt {{by the city}} and <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> as a freeway during World War II. The roadway {{was transferred to the}} jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 1993 and numbered as M-8. Subsequent changes by the state rebuilt the freeway and extended the M-8 designation to connect to the Jeffries Freeway (I-96).|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed after {{attempting}} {{to take off}} from Detroit Metropolitan <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> Airport, killing all but one passenger upon exploding at the I-94 overpass over Middlebelt Road; that overpass was not damaged in the crash. The freeway was closed until August 18, and a memorial was later installed near the interchange between I-94 and Middlebelt Road.|$|E

5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into <b>Wayne</b> <b>County,</b> and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{provisional}} government took other minor actions {{during the winter}} of 1861. An act was passed to rename <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> to Zollicoffer County in honor of Felix Zollicoffer, who died at the Battle of Mill Springs. Local officials were appointed in areas controlled by Confederate forces, including many justices of the peace. When the Confederate government eventually disbanded, the legality of marriages performed by these justices was questioned, but eventually upheld.|$|E
5|$|The {{state highway}} map in 1933 showed a {{proposed}} southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County, <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> into Monroe County. This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro Detroit {{to the west}} through Farmington, Northville, Plymouth and Belleville. The full highway was never built, and M-15 was never extended south of Clarkston, but part of this proposal was completed. Much of it later became Haggerty Highway, {{and part of the}} I-275 and M-5 corridors.|$|E

The section from NY250 {{to the existing}} expressway at the <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> line {{was built in the}} late 1970s while the main carriageway of NY104 between Five Mile Line Road and NY250 was completed in the early 1980s. NY404 was extended east along the former alignment of NY104 to the county line upon the total completion of the Five Mile Line Road–NY250 segment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Romulus, I-275 begins {{to take on a}} more {{suburban}} character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> Airport. There is access to {{the south side of the}} airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I-94. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins to run to the northwest. South of I-94, the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line and north of I-94, it passes a campus of <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> Community College and the headquarters of the Visteon Corporation, a major auto parts supplier spun off from Ford Motor Corporation. Near these two complexes, the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac, US12 (Michigan Avenue) and M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|NY441 was {{originally}} routed on Penfield Road between Brighton and Penfield {{when it was}} assigned in 1949. It remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and into <b>Wayne</b> <b>County</b> to Marion, where the highway ended at NY21. The entirety of this routing had previously been part of NY33, which was truncated westward to downtown Rochester as part of NY441's assignment. NY441 was cut back to NY350 in Walworth by 1970. The divided highway that now carries NY441 through Brighton and western Penfield was constructed during the late 1960s and opened as a realignment of NY441 by 1971.|$|E
