25|$|These were {{followed}} in later years, by other extensive factories filled with valuable machinery. Adjoining the saw mill mentioned, {{was a large}} <b>woolen</b> <b>factory,</b> which had just got into active operation when it was swept away by a most destructive fire in 1863, which also consumed the sawmill and its contents, and also a large planing mill and sash and door factory just erected by Mr. Henry Lye in close proximity. This great loss for a time checked {{the progress of the}} village, and paralyzed the enterprise of several active and industrious citizens. Another large factory erected for a cotton mill, a wool carding and knitting factory, and a bit larger saw mill than the former one, had in the meantime been erected {{on the south side of}} the river, just below the bridge, and these important structures with their valuable machinery, continue in active operation, and not only reflect much credit upon the enterprise of the place, but contribute much towards its prosperity.|$|E

Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. The town continued to grow however, based on a large industrial base. In fact, Galt was called [...] "Manchester of Canada" [...] because of the extensive industry, powered by the Grand River. Some of the important businesses in about 1870 included the Dickson Mills (opened in 1843), the Axe Factory forge, two furniture factories, The Dumfries iron and brass foundry, three large <b>woolen</b> <b>factories,</b> a malt factory, the Victoria Steam Carriage Works, the Dumfries Flour Mill, the Victoria Foundry making farm implements, a large soap and candles works and two steam powered tanneries.|$|R

50|$|Warner {{developed}} into a prosperous farming community which produced meats, dairy goods, vegetables, hay and apples. The Warner River and its tributaries provided water power for mills, which in 1832 included twelve sawmills, 6 gristmills, a paper mill and two clothing factories. By 1858, {{there was also a}} cabinet manufacturer and bottle manufacturer. In 1885, industries included a bedstead <b>factory,</b> chain <b>factory,</b> <b>woolen</b> cloth <b>factory,</b> iron foundry, tannery and glove manufacturer.

5000|$|After {{buying up}} {{worn-out}} land abandoned by westward immigrants, McBee practiced {{new methods of}} restoring the fertility of the soil, such as drainage, the use of manures, crop rotation, and seed selection. [...] In 1815 he purchased from Lemuel J. Alston more than 11,000 of acres of land in South Carolina, including {{the heart of what}} is today Greenville. He established a number of small industrial works on the Reedy River, including a sawmill, ironworks, brick yard, and stone quarry. McBee also engaged in selling leather goods, locating his tannery {{on the outskirts of the}} village. In 1829, he built a stone mill in Greenville and a flour mill and paper mill seven miles down stream in modern Conestee. [...] McBee used the same mill to operate cotton and <b>woolen</b> <b>factories,</b> ordering textile machinery from the New Jersey firm of Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor. McBee's cotton and woolen products were apparently competitive with those produced by the Northern textile industry.

March 9, 1739. In 1780, {{at the time of}} a visit of Catherine II, there was a Jewish population of 355, in 1,057; and the town possessed one synagogue. In 1803 the Jewish population was 453, in 1,185; in 1870 it was 2,433, in 4,167; and in 1897, 2,775, in about 6,000.

Chaussy was occupied during World War II by the Germans beginning in July 1941. Though a section of the Jewish population was able to escape before the Germans arrived, the remaining Jews were registered, marked and subjected to forced labor under the German occupation.

Other important dates for the local economy are 1828 when Jakob Zoeppritz from Darmstadt founded a <b>woolen</b> blanket <b>factory</b> and 1901 when Carl Schwenk of Ulm built the concrete factory.|$|R
