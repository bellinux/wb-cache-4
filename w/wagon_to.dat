5|$|After the war, Teaneck {{returned}} {{to being a}} quiet farm community. Fruits and vegetables grown locally were taken by <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> markets in nearby Paterson and New York City. New growth and development were spurred in the mid-19th century by the establishment of railroads throughout the area. Wealthy New Yorkers and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions and manor houses. They traveled daily to work in New York City, thus becoming Teaneck's first suburban commuters.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, {{traveled}} in a covered <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E

50|$|Rail {{operations}} at the works included mixed trains collecting empty livestock <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> be transported south and leaving full livestock wagons in the loop ready for unloading, as well as shuttling insulated <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> and from the port.|$|R
50|$|The South Australian and Victorian Railways used {{broad gauge}} {{transporter}} <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> carry narrow gauge <b>wagons</b> including locomotives <b>to</b> workshops and other isolated narrow gauge sections. In South Australia, these were called crocodile wagons. There {{does not appear}} to have been any attempt to operate train-loads of crocodile <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> diminish the disadvantages of the break of gauge.|$|R
5|$|At {{the height}} of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding. At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were {{evacuated}} from a flooded home via ambulance and <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> safer areas. In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at , were recorded. Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported but overall, the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the Galveston coast. After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} English at the first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del √Åguila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons. As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at the push of pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E

25|$|The kibbutzim in {{the area}} also used the railway to their {{economic}} advantage. In 1922, Deganya asked for a special <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> transport its dairy products to Haifa in the late night hours. Permission was granted, and gave Deganya and other kibbutzim access {{to other parts of}} the country and the world for export.|$|E
25|$|A {{straight}} Viking cult or Corpse road at Rosaring, Uppland, Sweden, was unearthed by archaeologists. The body of {{the dead}} Viking chieftains were drawn along it in a ceremonial <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> the grave site. The Netherlands had the Doodwegen or Spokenwegen, the deathroads or ghostroads, converging on medieval cemeteries, some surviving in straight section fragments to this day.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} freight <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> be {{produced}} by FM are flat, spine and tank cars.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{railways}} {{were often}} used within quarries to connect working levels. Sometimes a single cable railway would span multiple levels, allowing <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> be moved between the furthest levels {{in a single}} movement. In order to accommodate intermediate levels, turnouts were used <b>to</b> allow <b>wagons</b> <b>to</b> leave and join the cable railway part way along its length. Various methods were used to achieve this.|$|R

25|$|Wooden wedges may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent that the}} wagon is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, {{on opposite sides of the}} wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.|$|E
25|$|The railroad's representative, Grayson Butterfield, enlists McElroy, Potter, Tucker (one of Hollander's men), and Evans, {{to deliver}} Wade to Contention, where Wade {{will be put}} on the 3:10 {{afternoon}} train to Yuma Territorial Prison. Evans requests a $200 fee to deliver Wade for transport, which Butterfield accepts. From Evans' ranch, McElroy arranges a decoy <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> distract Wade's gang, now led by Charlie Prince, with the real prisoner transport departing later that night.|$|E
25|$|Hinged foot irons may be {{bolted to}} the sides of the <b>wagon.</b> <b>To</b> lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a {{reliable}} method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.|$|E

25|$|H√§agen-Dazs's founder Reuben Mattus {{was born}} in Poland in 1912 to Jewish parents. His father died during the First World War, and his widowed mother emigrated to New York City with her two {{children}} in 1921. They joined an uncle {{who was in the}} Italian lemon-ice business in Brooklyn. By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars and sandwiches under the name Senator Frozen Products on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> neighborhood stores in the Bronx.|$|E

At the {{beginning}} of this story, Pa Ingalls decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin, and move the family, via covered <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> the Indian Territory near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (technically still under Osage ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders imminently. So Laura, along with Pa and Ma, Mary, and baby Carrie, move to Kansas. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western mustangs, which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.|$|E
25|$|During the 1830s and 1840s, {{partners}} David Ritter and George Rodgers acquired {{several thousand}} {{acres in the}} Blacklick Valley and began construction of the furnace in 1845. Before completion, Rodgers sold his share to Lot Irvin, a farmer from Centre County. The furnace {{was one of the}} region's first to use the hot blast method. After the iron was produced at Eliza, it was carried by <b>wagon</b> <b>to</b> Nineveh (modern day Seward) in Westmoreland County or Johnstown, where it was transported by the Pennsylvania Canal to Pittsburgh. In 1848 the furnace produced over 1000 out of an estimated capacity of 1800 tons of iron. But the operation soon began to decline.|$|E
