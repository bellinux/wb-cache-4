In the current study, particle size, oil characteristics and chemical dispersant significantly influence the adsorption of oil droplets to SPM in seawater. Sediments with a smaller particulate size (clay) approaching that of the oil droplets (2 – 20 lm) adsorbed more oil per gram than sediments with large particle size (sand). Heavier, more polar oils with a high asphaltene content adsorbed more efficiently to SPM than lighter, less polar oils. A decrease in the smaller, more <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> components in the sediment adsorbed oil was observed for all oil types. Addition of chemical dispersant decreased the adsorption of oil droplets to suspended carbonate sand in an exponential-like manner.

40|$|The primary {{processes}} used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{for treatment}} of radioactively contaminated machine coolants are industrial waste treatment and in situ carbon adsorption. These two processes simplify approaches to meeting the sanitary sewer discharge limits and subsequent Land Disposal Restriction criteria for hazardous and mixed wastes (40 CFR 268). Several relatively simple technologies are used in industrial water treatment. These technologies are considered Best Demonstrated Available Technologies, or BDAT, by the Environmental Protection Agency. The machine coolants are primarily aqueous and contain <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> consisting of ethanol amine emulsifiers derived from fatty acids, both synthetic and natural. This emulsion carries away metal turnings from a part being machined on a lathe or other machining tool. When the coolant becomes spent, it contains chlorosolvents carried over from other cutting operations {{as well as a}} fair amount of tramp oil from machine bearings. This results in a multiphasic aqueous waste that requires treatment of metal and organic contaminants. During treatment, any dissolved metals are oxidized with hydrogen peroxide. Once oxidized, these metals are flocculated with ferric sulfate and precipitated with sodium hydroxide, and then the precipitate is filtered through diatomaceous earth. The emulsion is broken up by acidifying the coolant. Solvents and oils are adsorbed using powdered carbon. This carbon is easily separated from the remaining coolant by vacuum filtration...|$|E

While these materials solve {{a great deal of}} technological issue, they also pose considerable challenge in machining due to poor machinability characteristics. Many strategies have been devised. However, environmental friendly machining techniques have been given major emphasis and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique is one of them. Although molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) is widely regarded as solid lubricant material, its potential as an effective medium in MQL particularly in turning operation is yet to be explored. During the current research work, the effect of addition of MoS 2 powder, with average size of around 1 µm, in two different base fluids namely conventional <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> and paraffin oil (a mineral oil) has been investigated during turning of AISI 316 L grade austenitic stainless steel with the help response surface methodology (RSM) -based design of experiment.

The same powder also helped in bringing down cutting force and chip thickness while improving surface finish. It was observed that MoS 2 -mixed conventional cutting fluid demonstrated superior machining characteristics. Further attempt was also made to determine optimal cutting condition using grey relational analysis (GRA) -based multi objective optimization technique.

A natural cover system with gravel used as a capillary barrier was designed and evaluated as a method to hydrologically isolate buried <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> and gas wastes. Simulated cover systems were installed in 200 liter barrels and tested in a greenhouse. The treatments contained gravel barrier thicknesses of 0, 8, 15, 23, and 30 cm. Gravel was placed over a salt contaminated soil and was covered with 30 cm of a sandy clay topsoil. Drains were installed {{in the bottom of the}} barrels to collect drainage from the gravel layer and below the buried saline waste. Treatments were tested for effectiveness in both a wet and dry moisture regime using simulated monthly rainfall applications. Upward migration of soluble salts was monitored by measuring the electrical resistance of the soil by means of salinity sensors at the base of the topsoil. Electrical conductivity (EC) measurements of the leachate were used to determine the downward movement of soluble salts. Total volume of leachate from each drain was also monitored for each simulated month. Core samples were taken to determine the EC of the topsoil at the conclusion of the experiment. Electrical resistance values indicated that upward soluble salt migration occurred immediately on treatments which did not include a capillary barrier. EC values for all gravel barrier treatments indicated no upward migration of the buried saline waste. Values for EC at the base of the topsoil ranged from 10 to 20 dS M- 1 in the treatments with no capillary barrier to 0. 1 to 1. 0 dS M- 1 in treatments containing a capillary barrier. Effluent EC was significantly higher (29 - 56 dS M- 1) from below the saline soil than from the gravel drain (2 - 9 dS M- 1). In addition, 93 % of the leachate from both moisture regimes that permeated the cover system was collected from the gravel drain. These results indicate that a cover system which includes a capillary barrier would protect groundwater by greatly decreasing downward movement of water soluble constituents. Upward migration of buried water soluble wastes would also be prevented which would in turn protect the topsoil and surface waters...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDispersing an {{oil slick}} is {{considered}} to be an effective response to offshore oil spills. However, in nearshore areas, dispersant application is a controversial countermeasure: environmental benefits are counteracted by the toxicity of dispersant use. In our study, the actual toxicity of the dispersant response technique in the nearshore area was evaluated through an experimental approach using juvenile Liza ramada. Fish were contaminated via the water column (i) by chemically dispersed oil, simulating dispersant application, (ii) by dispersant, as an internal control of chemical dispersion, (iii) by mechanically dispersed oil, simulating only the effect of natural mixing processes, without dispersant application, and (iv) by the <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> fraction of <b>oil,</b> simulating the toxicity of an oil slick before recovery. Bioconcentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mortality were evaluated, and related to both total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in seawater. Fish exposed to chemically dispersed oil showed both a higher bioconcentration of PAH and a higher mortality than fish exposed to either the <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> fraction of <b>oil</b> or the mechanically dispersed oil. These results suggest that (i) dispersion is a more toxic response technique than containment and recovery of the oil slick; (ii) in turbulent mixing areas, dispersant application increases the environmental risk for aquatic organisms living in the water column.

The three cutting fluids chosen were neat <b>oil,</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> and semi-synthetic cutting fluids. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the fluids at various cutting velocities of 20, 40 and 60 m/min and feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 06 and 0. 07 mm/tooth. The results were measured in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece, the cutting forces and the maximum flank wear. In addition, the resultant chip formations were also observed. Analysis of the results has shown that in general, neat oil had performed the best in low cutting velocities and feed rates. On the other hand, <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> gave the lowest cutting forces and flank wears at high cutting velocities and feed rated as compared to neat oil and synthetic cutting fluid.

Moreover, when these guest molecules are drug moieties, then the resulting drug/dendrimer complexes can be considered ideal candidates for use as novel drug delivery systems...|$|R

The extraction of caffeine from <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> materials, especially instant tea, is {{more suitable for}} an organic chemistry teaching laboratory than the classic experiment using tea leaves, due to the economy of time and a larger amount of extracted caffeine. The procedure is time-saving and requires only a four-hour period. The experiments illustrate the extraction process as used in undergraduate organic chemistry laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Mineral oils, when {{emulsified}} {{with materials}} such as soaps of petroleum sulfonates, fatty acids, abietic acid or resin, {{are referred to as}} <b>soluble</b> <b>oils.</b> These oils, mixed with water, form stable emulsions which are universally employed as coolants and lubricants for drilling, cutting, and grinding of metals. In addition to the emulsifying agent, <b>soluble</b> <b>oils</b> may also contain fatty oils, disinfectants and emulsion stabilizers. The oils supplied by the manufacturer are sterile, but when mixed with water in the machine shop they support microbial growth (Duffet et al., 1943; Fabian and Pivnick, 1953; Lee and Chandler, 1941; Page and Bushnell, 1921). In fact, contaminants from soil, floor sweepings, air, river water, and feces grow readily in these emulsions (Fabian and Pivnick, 1953). The C. B. Dolge Company (undated pamphlet) has reported that feces and other body discharges are found in <b>soluble</b> <b>oil</b> emulsions. Duffet et al. (1943), Page and Bushnell (1921), and Pivnick and Fabian (unpublished data) found coliform bacteria in samples obtained from factories in the United States. Recently, Pivnick (unpublished data) has found that emulsions from factories in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States contained between 103 and 105 coliform bacteria per ml. The relationship of fecal pollution to the spread of enteric diseases suggested that an investigation of enteric pathogens in <b>soluble</b> <b>oils</b> should be undertaken. Preliminary experiments by Okawaki (1953) showed that enteric pathogens grew well in this medium. This report is concerned with the growth of some representative enteric pathogens and Klebsiella pneumoniae...|$|R
