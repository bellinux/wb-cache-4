5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that observed for {{the northern part of the}} rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocity,</b> making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E

Shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement and standard penetration test are generally expensive and are not feasible to be carried out at large number of sites for the purpose of microzonation. Ambient Vibrations measurement (also called Microtremor) has become a popular method for determining the dynamic properties of soil strata and is being extensively used for microzonation. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for microzonation.|$|E

40|$|Shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocities</b> of the {{sediment}} fill {{of a deep}} Alpine valley are estimated from ambient noise recorded on linear and circular arrays. We propose a combined inversion of 2 ‐D resonance frequencies identified from site‐to‐reference spectral ratios and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves obtained from frequency‐wavenumber analysis. The method is tested on synthetic noise data and on noise recorded at three sites in the Rhône valley in Southern Switzerland. Previous {{studies have shown that}} 2 ‐D resonance dominates the ambient vibration wavefield at low frequencies at the investigated sites. Inversion techniques which assume that the noise wavefield consists mainly of horizontally propagating surface waves will, therefore, fail to resolve shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocities</b> at depths below around 500 m.

25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The <b>wave</b> <b>velocity</b> effects the entire water basin. The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls {{on the bottom of}} the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and electronic cones, {{a variety of other}} CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a geophone set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain soil strength analysis. Engineers use the shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocity</b> and shear modulus to determine the soil's behavior under low-strain and vibratory loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity, pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear <b>wave</b> <b>velocity</b> in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

In this study, we make use of a laboratory model made of an approximate transversely isotropic Phenolite to study acoustic logging in deviated wells. We drill holes at various deviations relative to the symmetry axis in the Phenolite block. Then we perform monopole and dipole sonic measurements in these holes and extract the qP, qSV, SH, and Stoneley <b>wave</b> <b>velocities</b> using the slowness-time domain semblance method. The velocities measured using monopole and dipole loggings vary with borehole deviations.

2500|$|While a {{planetary}} system may enjoy a location favorable to complex life, {{it must also}} maintain that location for a span of time sufficiently long for complex life to evolve. Hence a central star with a galactic orbit that steers clear of galactic regions where radiation levels are high, such as the Galactic Center and the spiral arms, would appear most favourable. If the central star's galactic orbit is eccentric (elliptic or hyperbolic), it will pass through some spiral arms, but if the orbit is a near perfect circle and the orbital velocity equals the [...] "rotational" [...] velocity of the spiral arms, the star will drift into a spiral arm region only gradually—if at all.
