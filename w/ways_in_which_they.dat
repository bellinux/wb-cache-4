25|$|A common {{image is}} the scala naturae, {{the ladder of}} nature on which animals of {{different}} species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top. A more useful approach has been to recognize that different animals may have different kinds of cognitive processes, which are better understood in terms of the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are cognitively adapted to their different ecological niches, than by positing any kind of hierarchy.|$|E

High Lamas often visit Lhamo La-tso, a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV), {{commonly known as}} Feline AIDS is a lentivirus that affects domesticated housecats worldwide.

In order for a policy to have any effect, the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem, and <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.|$|E

Preventive care is the best method of preserving human remains in the long term, as active conservation work should be limited both by conservators' policy to interfere as little as possible and the beliefs of many indigenous tribes and groups who disapprove of altering human remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include lexical sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and lexical substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of lexical resources.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> attain food {{and interact with}} raptors {{of their own and}} other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter’s night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.|$|E

Hendrix joked: [...] "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: [...] "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire {{at the end of a}} 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the [...] "Black Elvis" [...] and the [...] "Wild Man of Borneo".|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{functions}} of botanical gardens have already been discussed in the sections above, which emphasise the scientific underpinning of botanical gardens with their focus on research, education and conservation. However, as multifaceted organisations, all sites have their own special interests. In a remarkable paper {{on the role of}} botanical gardens, Ferdinand Mueller (1825–1896), the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne (1852–1873), stated, [...] "in all cases the objects [...] must be mainly scientific and predominantly instructive". He then detailed many of the objectives being pursued by the world's botanical gardens {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when European gardens were at their height. Many of these are listed below to give a sense of the scope of botanical gardens' activities at that time, and the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> differed from parks or what he called [...] "public pleasure gardens": ...|$|E
500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, and the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; {{and the reason for}} this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, {{had much to do with}} economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{widespread}} feelings of fatalism, some men {{believe that they}} can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors. Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> choose their sexual partners. For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus. Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered [...] "pure." [...] Because of this perception, many people are concerned that schoolchildren in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.|$|E

500|$|Senators {{had several}} <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> could {{influence}} (or frustrate) a presiding magistrate. When a presiding magistrate was proposing a motion, for example, the senators could call [...] "consult" [...] (consule), which required the magistrate {{to ask for}} the opinions of the senators. Any senator could demand a quorum call (with the cry of numera), which required a count of the senators present. Like modern quorum calls, this was usually a delaying tactic. Senators could also demand that a motion be divided into smaller motions. Acts such as applause, booing, or heckling often {{played a major role in}} a debate, and, in part because all senators had an absolute right to free speech, any senator could respond at any point if he was attacked personally. Once debates were underway, they were usually difficult for the presiding magistrate to control. The presiding magistrate typically only regained some control once the debating had ended, and a vote was about to be taken.|$|E
500|$|Antibodies used in {{research}} {{are some of}} the most powerful, yet most problematic reagents with a tremendous number of factors that must be controlled in any experiment including cross reactivity, or the antibody recognizing multiple epitopes and affinity, which can vary widely depending on experimental conditions such as pH, solvent, state of tissue etc. Multiple attempts have been made to improve both the way that researchers validate antibodies and <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> report on antibodies. Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by other researchers). Less than half of research antibodies referenced in academic papers can be easily identified. Papers published in F1000 in 2014 and 2015 provide researchers with a guide for reporting research antibody use.
