5|$|Under Grace's {{leadership}} at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted {{very well and}} totalled 310 {{on the first day}} before reducing the Players to 39–4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered on Tuesday morning, thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2–31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6–1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never in the hunt and, although Selby was defiant with another half-century, Grace took 4–55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory.|$|E

All boys are encouraged to play when they enter Lower Grammar but are not required to play throughout their time at the school. Stonyhurst has a successful rugby season, with games <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by pupils, staff and parents.

The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually, attracting large crowds and teams from all over the country.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{returned}} to London and played {{in his next}} match, starting on Monday, 13 May, for MCC against an England XI at Lord's. This was another first-class fixture, scheduled for three days but completed in two, the mostly professional England XI winning by 3 wickets. MCC won the toss, batted first and totalled 93, half of which were scored by Grace himself with 47. England reached 75–6 at the close and were all out for 115 on Tuesday morning, but MCC were then dismissed for only 58, Grace having been first out for 1. Nevertheless, England struggled to complete their victory and lost 7 wickets in scoring the necessary 37 runs. In cold, damp conditions it was therefore a bowlers' match. Grace was dismissed in both innings by Tom Emmett, who was <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by Billy Midwinter and Alex Watson. The MCC attack was led by Alfred Shaw, who took 10 wickets. Grace bowled in the first innings only and returned figures of 3–43. Grace's 47 in the first innings was the top score in the game, the second highest being 30 by Arthur Shrewsbury for England. Grace sustained a thumb injury during the match which prevented him {{taking part in the}} England second innings.|$|E
5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E

5|$|Infanticide {{exists in}} {{numerous}} rodent species {{and may be}} practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, {{in the case of}} males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> in primates and lions but less so in rodents. Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots, dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort.|$|E
5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lộc Ninh {{was a major}} battle fought {{during the}} Easter Offensive during the Vietnam War, {{which took place in}} Bình Long Province, South Vietnam between 4–7 April 1972. Towards the end of 1971, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a major {{offensive}} against South Vietnam, with the objective of destroying Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units and capturing as much territory as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position in the Paris Peace Accords. On 30 March 1972, two North Vietnamese Army divisions smashed through the Demilitarized Zone, marking the commencement of the Easter Offensive. They quickly overwhelmed South Vietnamese units in the I Corps Tactical Zone. With the rapid collapse of South Vietnamese forces in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces began preparing for their next offensive, targeting Bình Long Province in the Mekong Delta region. On 4 April, the Việt Cộng's 5th Division opened their attack on Lộc Ninh, defended by the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment. After three days of fighting, the vastly outnumbered South Vietnamese forces, though <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by American air power, were forced to abandon their positions in Lộc Ninh.|$|E

This attack was <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by artillery and a squadron of armour from the 8th Hussars, nevertheless, the commandos were stopped near an orchard close to the crossroads by a hastily formed, but well-led, force consisting of Luftwaffe aircrew and Fallschirmjäger. As the rest of the brigade advanced towards the town of Linne, attempts to cross the Montforterbeek Canal were frustrated by the defenders who managed to destroy all the bridges that crossed it. The ice over the canal was not thick enough to support the crossing of armour, so temporary bridges were brought up and erected by members of the Royal Engineers. Finally, after a number of attempts at forcing a crossing, an assault force from No. 3 Commando managed to enter Linne.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not <b>well</b> <b>supported</b> by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia (πεντηκονταετία, the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is, used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
