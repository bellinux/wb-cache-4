5|$|The overture, often {{played as}} a concert piece {{independently}} from the opera, <b>was,</b> <b>unusually,</b> composed before almost {{any of the}} other music had been written.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was common}} to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans. The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, {{in the belief that}} the Ka of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial.|$|E
5|$|Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Charles Lyell {{attacked}} it vigorously. It {{has been}} suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, and because he <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.|$|E
50|$|Height: The {{perpetrator}} <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> {{short for}} a man. The suspect <b>is</b> also <b>unusually</b> short for a man.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{although}} the voltage <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> high, the short-circuit current <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> low. Overall, materials that exhibit the anomalous photovoltaic effect have very low power generation efficiencies, and are never used in practical power-generation systems.|$|R
50|$|Rasui Gumpha <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> {{very small}} cave.|$|R
5|$|The castle's {{location}} was ostensibly chosen to protect England's south coast from raids by the French. A landscape {{survey by the}} Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that {{if this were the}} case, then Bodiam Castle <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> sited, as it is far from the medieval coastline.|$|E
5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor {{and found them}} to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas' {{increase}} in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid {{expressed a desire}} to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would not listen to any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal's playing style and Wenger as reasons for his long-term commitment to the club.|$|E
25|$|The piscine of Saint-Urbain, {{which dates}} to 1265, <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> large.|$|R
50|$|The Sarcofagi of Carajía <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> large sarcofagi in Carajía, Peru.|$|R
50|$|Microcheilia is a {{congenital}} disorder where one's lips <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> small.|$|R
5|$|The league <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> competitive; {{a mistake}} in early April caused Benfica to lose much of their lead. Qualifying for the Portuguese Cup final did not help them to gather momentum. In early May, Benfica {{suffered}} a major blow, losing away to Penafiel and dropping to second. A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E
5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|The series {{used the}} first {{incarnation}} of the Blackadder theme by Howard Goodall (with {{the exception of the}} unaired pilot, which featured a different arrangement). For the opening theme, a trumpet solo accompanied by an orchestra was used. For the end titles, the theme gained mock-heroic lyrics sung by a baritone (Simon Carrington, a member of the King's Singers). In the final episode, the theme was sung with altered lyrics by a treble, in a more reflective style. The series' incidental music <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> performed by pipe organ and percussion.|$|E
60|$|Esmond, who had <b>been</b> <b>unusually</b> patient hitherto, {{apparently}} {{lost his}} self-command.|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} was mainly monologue. Both Marjorie and Daffy <b>were</b> <b>unusually</b> thoughtful.|$|R
50|$|Sidney's Arcadia has {{a history}} that <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> complex even for its time.|$|R
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> metal-poor.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (myxomycetes) have been {{isolated}} from the bark of Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) were from the order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of the bark. Another order, the Physarales, <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> rare—other studies have demonstrated that the order is typically abundant on the bark of various species of tree around the world.|$|E
5|$|Under Malamir and Presian, Isbul headed Bulgaria's {{successful}} {{campaigns against}} the Byzantines in southern Thrace and Macedonia, {{which led to}} a significant territorial expansion of the Bulgarian realm. As a co-ruler of Malamir, Isbul also financed the construction of a water conduit in the capital Pliska. As second-in-command, Isbul held enormous power and wealth, and <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> often mentioned beside the name of the ruler in inscriptions. Due to his merits, Isbul has been described as an architect of medieval Bulgarian statehood by historians.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> large aggressions of Bryde's whales inhabit between Curacao and Venezuela.|$|R
5000|$|The basin <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> {{deep and}} steep-sided {{compared}} to the lake's surface area ...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Arms are of Charles II and <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> {{large and}} finely coloured.|$|R
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. Though people affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of the}} Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{political}} events that frame the historical dimension of Aufbauliteratur <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> clearly: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{seventeenth century}} church of Saint-Martin. The {{clock on the}} bell-tower <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> off-centre.|$|R
5|$|Ucuhuba seed oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of Virola surinamensis, <b>is</b> <b>unusually</b> high in myristic acid.|$|R
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|Sunrise was at 6:48am that morning, {{and reports}} of the day record that it <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> bright. The weather {{conditions}} are not recorded. The route that the English army took to the battlefield is not known precisely. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans {{at the site of}} the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges's account is correct.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} <b>was</b> <b>unusually</b> {{complex for}} the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings. The first quarter consists of {{the arms of his}} father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare quartering Despenser (the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser), which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second quarter showed the arms of the Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
50|$|The Chuvash <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> {{susceptible}} to Osteopetrosis, with a prevalence of 1 of every 3,500-4,000 newborns.|$|R
50|$|It {{includes}} the highly abundant marine species Pelagibacter ubique. Bacteria in this clade <b>are</b> <b>unusually</b> small.|$|R
50|$|Sea safety {{standards}} <b>were</b> <b>unusually</b> high and included modern (1948) smoke detection, fire control and fireproofing.|$|R
