5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern {{incinerators}} operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> south Tyne and Wear.|$|E

The solid <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine were investigated by multiple miner-alogical techniques in this paper. Calcite and quartz were the major components of the solid wastes by X-ray diffraction spectrum. Several elements such as O, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ca, K, S, Si, Al, As and Na were detected in the solid wastes by electron microprobe analysis. Although the solid wastes contained heavy metals, their concentrations in the leaching solution of the solid wastes by ICP were less than the identification standard for hazardous waste. Therefore, the solid <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> the Nanjing YinMao Lead-Zinc Mine are not hazardous...|$|R

However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> other materials.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
