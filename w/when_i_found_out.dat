[...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is."

The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation.

[...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces".
