5|$|In 1802, {{during the}} Haitian Revolution, Dermide {{arrived on the}} island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, {{as part of the}} Saint-Domingue expedition.

5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E

5|$|She married Paul Mansfield at age 17 on May 10, 1950. Their daughter, Jayne Marie Mansfield, {{was born}} {{six months later}} on November 8, 1950. After getting married, Jayne and her husband {{enrolled}} in Southern Methodist University to study acting. In 1951, she moved to Austin, Texas, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> studied dramatics at the University of Texas at Austin, until her junior year. There {{she worked as a}} nude model for art classes, sold books door to door, and worked as a receptionist of a dance studio. She also joined the Curtain Club, a popular campus theatrical society that featured Tom Jones, Harvey Schmidt, Rip Torn, and Pat Hingle among its members of that time.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ely, Nevada, {{she grew}} up with her two {{brothers}} {{in what is now}} Cerritos, California, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters.

Richard Nixon was elected Vice President in the Eisenhower administration, whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and later in his successful 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E

5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new emotions to expess in terms of her relationship <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> children.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, at 19, {{she married}} Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately {{believed}} {{by family and}} friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, {{with whom she had}} fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the Crimea <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> children, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler, co-creator of the Degrassi {{franchise}} and CEO of Epitome Pictures, was the co-executive {{producer of}} season six <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> Epitome Pictures' president, Stephen Stohn.

5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, along <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got {{back in touch with}} Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Just {{outside the}} Eastlake Estates, an honors {{ceremony}} {{was being held}} at Westmoore High School {{at the time of}} the tornado. Adequate warning time allowed those at the school to seek shelter, however, and more than 400 adults and children attending the awards ceremony at the school's auditorium were moved to the main building, sheltering in reinforced hallways and bathrooms. Ultimately, Westmoore High sustained heavy damage and dozens of cars in the parking lot were tossed around, some of which were completely destroyed or thrown into nearby homes. No injuries took place at the school, though a horse was found dead between a couple of destroyed cars in this area. The tornado proceeded through additional densely populated areas of Moore shortly thereafter, where several large groups of homes were flattened in residential areas, with a mixture of high-end F4 and low-end F5 damage noted. Near Janeway Avenue, four people were killed in an area where multiple homes were completely destroyed. A woman, who took shelter <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> two children, was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass on Interstate 35. The tornado weakened somewhat as it moved through the Highland Park neighborhood of Moore, but still caused widespread F3 and F4 damage.|$|E
