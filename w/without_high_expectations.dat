5000|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the link between}} cognitive dissonance and impulse buying have shown that impulse buyers experience less cognitive dissonance when they are disappointed with their purchase. The main explanation {{for this is that}} impulse buyers go into the purchase already <b>without</b> <b>high</b> <b>expectations.</b> [...] Another possible explanation, at least among more sophisticated buyers, is that persons who are dissatisfied with a purchase that they made on impulse may blame that dissatisfaction at least in part on their own failure to thoroughly consider whether the product will satisfy their prior expectations even if it performs as advertised, thus blaming any discrepancy at least in part on themselves (via their own impulsivity) rather than on the purchased product (via any sort of difference between its promised and its actual attributes and/or performance).|$|E
40|$|In 1983 a {{group of}} young East German women defied repressive laws and artistic {{conventions}} to form an unassumingly renegade collaborative group with a naive mission: to create an alternative meaning in their lives through art, beauty, and camaraderie. In this way they presented a subversive resistance to the one-party state 2 ̆ 7 s authoritarian regime that dictated the role of art in the German Democratic Republic 2 ̆ 7 s (GDR) society. The group, 1 founded by the small city of Erfurt in the German state of Thuringia by ambitious dissident Gabriele Stötzer, 2 began <b>without</b> <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> of rebellion, and yet eventually grew into a performance art collaborative that focused on self-expression and social disruption. Before creating their performances, Stötzer and these women expressed themselves through paintings, weavings, photography, pottery, amateur 8 mm films, and sewing clothes. By 1991 they founded a space, the Kunsthaus Erfurt (Art House Erfurt), for contemporary art exhibits, workshops and studio spaces. The Kunthaus Erfurt still thrives today and symbolizes the legitimacy of their six-year (1983 - 1989) resistance against the GDR 2 ̆ 7 s directives...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{coverage}} of malaria vector control interventions globally {{has led to}} significant reductions in disease burden. However due to its high recurrent cost, {{there is a need}} to determine if and when vector control can be safely scaled back after transmission has been reduced.; A mathematical model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemiology was simulated to determine the impact of scaling back vector control on transmission and disease. A regression analysis of simulation results was conducted to derive predicted probabilities of resurgence, severity of resurgence and time to resurgence under various settings. Results indicate that, in the absence of secular changes in transmission, there are few scenarios where vector control can be removed <b>without</b> <b>high</b> <b>expectation</b> of resurgence. These, potentially safe, scenarios are characterized by low historic entomological inoculation rates, successful vector control programmes that achieve elimination or near elimination, and effective surveillance systems with high coverage and effective treatment of malaria cases.; Programmes and funding agencies considering scaling back or withdrawing vector control from previously malaria endemic areas need to first carefully consider current receptivity and other available interventions in a risk assessment. Surveillance for resurgence needs to be continuously conducted over a long period of time in order to ensure a rapid response should vector control be withdrawn...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{compare the}} effects of 90 ° and 180 ° conjunctival {{rotational}} autograft (CRA) techniques used in primary pterygium surgery. Methods: Forty-five patients were included in this retrospective study. Visual acuity (VA), corneal topography, and auto-refractometer measurements, as well as detailed biomicroscopic examinations, were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. During surgery, the pterygium tissue was excised then rotated 90 ° in Group 1 and 180 ° in Group 2, after which it was sutured to the bare sclera. Pterygium recurrence was defined as corneal invasion ≥ 1 mm. Results: Group 1 consisted of 21 patients {{with a mean age}} of 45. 1 ± 11. 8 years, while Group 2 comprised 24 patients {{with a mean age of}} 47. 9 ± 13. 8 years. The pterygia in Group 1 were graded as more advanced than those in Group 2. A similar number of recurrences were observed in Group 1 (14. 3 %) and in Group 2 (16. 7 %). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of the preoperative and postoperative VA and astigmatism values between the two groups. There was a statistically significant improvement in the postoperative VA and astigmatism values in Group 1 and in the postoperative astigmatism values in Group 2. Although postoperative redness was more common in Group 1, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. Conclusion: BothCRA techniques can be successful in patients for whom it is desirable to avoid a conjunctival autograft and for patients <b>without</b> <b>high</b> cosmetic <b>expectations...</b>|$|R

30|$|The fifth {{departure}} from tradition is the significant place accorded to <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> and {{equity in the}} Framework. <b>High</b> <b>expectations</b> and equity {{are one of the}} five principles on which the Framework is based. The expectation is that all children can succeed, “regardless of diverse circumstances and abilities” (Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, p. 12). When educators have clear goals, <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> and knowledge of the skills and dispositions needed for learning and successful transition to school, children make more progress in literacy, numeracy, independence, cooperation, and social development (Thorpe et al., 2004). Holding <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> for all children’s success in learning is reflected in the outcomes statements (e.g., Outcome 1, p. 22; Outcome 3, p. 31). Having <b>high</b> <b>expectations</b> that all children can succeed in learning means a focus by educators on children’s learning and that educators are proactive in leading children’s learning; all the while maintaining a balance between adult initiated and child initiated learning opportunities.|$|R
