They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty.

25|$|A dimmer is {{a device}} used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>decrease,</b> thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant three-phase power. They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|E

If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions.

40|$|Introduction: Pattern {{recognition}} of various phases of normal endometrium and endometrial pathologies during hysteroscopy has many advantages. It {{would help to}} triage women with AUB, {{so as to be}} selective with biopsies and curettages. Recognition of normal variant or benign lesion would reduce burden to the pathologist by decreasing the number of unnecessary sampling. It <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>decreases</b> anxiety of the patient as the report/prognostication can be instant in many cases. Material and methods: This prospective, double blind, correlation study was carried out in the teaching hospital with a sample population of 70 women presenting with AUB who underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling. We identified patterns of endometrium which can used to predict six endometrial pathologies which were later correlated with the final histological diagnosis. Results: There was good correlation between hysteroscopic patterns and histopathology report, 33 % of starry sky appearance correlated with atrophic endometrium, 87 % of tongue shaped projections correlated with endometrial polyp, 44. 4 % of pebble stone appearance correlated with myomatous polyp, 50 % of polypoidal pattern correlated with endometrial hyperplasia. 100 % correlation was seen in strawberry appearance, pattern for secretory endometrium and cerebroid appearance which was pattern designated to endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic pattern recognition is a useful concept to triage women who require sampling for histopathological diagnosis.

The pitch-over-height ratios P/H of Cross-corrugated (CC) surface is from 1. 5 to 4. 0, included angles β= 75 º. The study was performed using CFD software FLUENT to create unit model and simulate fluid temperature, velocity, heat transfer coefficient and other parameters.
