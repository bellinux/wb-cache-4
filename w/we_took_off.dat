We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not press on with another attack.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, a {{news conference}} {{was held in the}} grand showroom. Giles {{emphasized}} the importance of the route as an indication of the future, both for civil and military aircraft. He warned: [...] "Now that we have proved that we can do it, we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it". LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B-29 was capable of flying 6,500 miles nonstop. He said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it. However, all our information indicated that once we passed Fairbanks it would drop. We didn't need a tailwind. All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule. The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph" [...] (110km/h). After the reporters were finished, Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight, including parachutes. They were offered free rides home on military aircraft. Potts refused the parachute and the ride, telling Giles, [...] "Thank you, general, I think I'll take the train!" ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E

This part will be lined, i.e. boarded, neatly inside. The rest of the building is very rough, but it answers its purpose.|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{pulled back}} to where the vessel had sunk and on our way picked up six men who were {{swimming}} – two of whom were drunk and gave us much trouble all the time. The six men we picked up were hauled into the boat by the women. Two of these men died in the boat. The boat we were in started to take in water; I do not know how. We had to bail. I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in our boat, so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1992, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Beautiful Son," [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] and [...] "Old Age" [...] during a recording session at Word of Mouth Recording in Seattle with producer Jack Endino. The three-song session was later released in April 1993 as Hole's fourth single on the City Slang label. On January 21, 1993, Love and Schemel recorded five demo songs at BMG Ariola Ltda. in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produced by Craig Montgomery, the session was originally a demo session for Nirvana, who were recording material for their upcoming studio album, In Utero (1993). During breaks in Nirvana's session, Love and Schemel recorded {{a number of}} songs later featured on Live Through This, including [...] "Miss World," [...] "She Walks on Me," [...] "I Think That I Would Die" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest." [...] The band relocated back to Los Angeles where they recruited former Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff in early 1993; Pfaff was also an accomplished cellist and music student. Erlandson said of Pfaff's membership: [...] "That's when <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off,</b> {{all of a sudden}} we became a real band." [...] After a brief tour of the United Kingdom in the summer of 1993, the band sent a series of demos to the record label. [...] "When we got the Live Through This demos, I realized very quickly that Hole had gotten a new rhythm section," [...] said producer Sean Slade. [...] "It was much more musical." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on May 14, 2013, with an update titled Uprising. This release build improved {{many aspects of the}} game, such as the graphics and character progression, and introduced the planetary conquest mechanic. Although Uprising was the initial release build, CCP said {{that it would not be}} the final major update: [...] "Even when <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> the beta tag the launches don’t stop. We’ll launch significant updates indefinitely... It’s an on-going service that will keep getting better and better." ...|$|R

60|$|I went to bed. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our ball-dresses, {{let down}} our hair, put our feet into slippers, {{and then sat}} by the fire in my room talking over the evening, and our partners, and our {{impressions}} of everything.|$|E
60|$|As {{the morning}} {{advanced}} {{and the weather}} grew hot, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our outside clothing and sat in a row {{along the edge of}} the raft and enjoyed the scenery, with our sun-umbrellas over our heads and our legs dangling in the water.|$|E

5000|$|... {{a mob of}} 12 men {{on horseback}} came upon us with ropes to bind us, headed by one John Thompson.

60|$|Two of our boats, {{with men}} all safe, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> the Cisco, and, to Wolf Larsen’s huge delight {{and my own}} grief, he culled Smoke, with Nilson and Leach, from the San Diego. So that, {{at the end of}} five days, we found {{ourselves}} short but four men—Henderson, Holyoak, Williams, and Kelly,—and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd.|$|E
60|$|After we {{got back}} to Ada's <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our things, and sat down for a long, cozy chat about the past. I found she was very happy in her married life, and that her husband was all she could {{possibly}} wish him. I certainly thought that her happiness had improved her; for, although quite as cheerful as of old, she had a quiet dignity which very much became her. She said that she hoped, when we were able to enter into gaiety again, that we would let her take us with her into society.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Mission-house {{had lost}} its roof in a gale of wind. The {{epidemic}} that was raging last year {{did not seem to}} have continued long after with such violence; some more of the people were dead, but not very many. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> all the Mota boys, and things that were wanted in three boat-loads, the last time leaving the Bishop. There was, fortunately, very little surf, and we got nothing wet, but as the tide was high, we had to carry the things over the coral reefs with the water a little above our knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no use, Woods, in bothering {{ourselves}} {{about these}} things, after all," [...] observed captain Willoughby, one day, {{when the subject}} of hanging the long-neglected gates came up between them.

We are as safe, here, as we should be in Hyde Park; and safer too; for there house-breakers and foot-pads abound; whereas, your preaching has left nothing but very vulgar and everyday sinners at the Knoll." ...|$|R

"I did {{not argue}} with my father, {{for he was}} a man who hated to be {{differed}} with, and I agreed to help him carry out his little joke. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our shoes and walked quietly to the back of the house. My father stood below, and I climbed up the trellis under the back window, which he pointed out. The window-sash was down all but a little crack to let in air, and I raised it so slowly and gently that I made no noise. Then without any trouble at all I got into the room.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our blue woollen shirts, our spurs, {{and heavy}} boots, our sanguinary revolvers and our buckskin-seated pantaloons, and got shaved {{and came out}} in Christian costume once more. All but Jack, who changed all other {{articles}} of his dress, but clung to his traveling pantaloons. They still preserved their ample buckskin seat intact; and so his short pea jacket and his long, thin legs assisted {{to make him a}} picturesque object whenever he stood on the forecastle looking abroad upon the ocean over the bows. At such times his father's last injunction suggested itself to me. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{there was}} a good flat place before we came to the river, and I stopped long before that! So then, as we had been the birds of the air, we thought we would be the fishes of the sea; and it was nice and shallow, with dear little caddises and river cray-fish, and great British pearl-shells at the bottom. So <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> our shoes and stockings, and Charlie and Armyn turned up their trousers, and we had such a nice paddling. I really thought I should have got a British pearl then; and you know there were some in the breast-plate of Venus." ...|$|E
