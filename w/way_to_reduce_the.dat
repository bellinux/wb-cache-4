25|$|Fundamentally, {{an atomic}} orbital is a one-electron wave function, {{even though most}} {{electrons}} do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital vision which (even {{if it is not}} spelled out) is heavily influenced by this Hartree–Fock approximation, which is one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> complexities of molecular orbital theory.|$|E
25|$|One simple <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> heat of {{decanting}} {{is to open}} valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly {{be allowed}} through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops {{are present in the}} pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E

25|$|Because of the inverse-square law {{in radio}} communications, the digital data rates {{used in the}} downlinks from the Voyagers have been {{continually}} decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. Some measures were taken on the ground along the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64m to 70m, dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{for such}} wide {{recovery}} {{has been made}} in several areas. The first is that, as is common in tort law, policy reasons should allow those injured to have means of compensation. Employers generally have larger assets, and greater means with which to offset any losses (deep pocket compensation) Secondly, it is under the instruction of an employer by which a tort is committed; the employer can be seen to gain from the duties of their employees, and thus must bear the consequences of any wrongdoings committed by them. Lastly, it has been justified as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> taking of risks by employers, and to ensure adequate precautions are taken in conducting business.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} manuscripts had negligible punctuation {{and breathing}} marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs {{would be a}} continuous string of letters (scriptio continua), often with line breaks {{in the middle of}} words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the nomina sacra. Yet another method involved the palimpsest, a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased {{to make way for a}} new text (for example Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus and the Syriac Sinaiticus).|$|E

25|$|Oversize {{and larger}} racquets are {{generally}} used by older recreational players, as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> impact of aging on their tennis competitiveness. The largest legal racquets, which {{are known as}} super-oversize frames, have proven extremely rare in professional competition, with only Monica Seles being a top 10 or higher ranked player who used one (a 125 square inch Yonex) during her career at any time. Andre Agassi achieved considerable success with an oversize racquet, a fact that was often noted due to his rivalry with Pete Sampras, a player who used a much smaller midsize frame. Oversize racquets are generally considered to offer more power but less control, a trend that exists from the smallest racquet size ("standard") to the largest legal size, which is 135 square inches.|$|E
25|$|In some styles or settings, such as {{country music}} clubs or churches, small venues, {{or when a}} live {{recording}} is being made, the drummer may use a transparent perspex or plexiglas drum screen (also known as a drum shield) to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit {{is known as a}} drum booth. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.|$|E
500|$|Palliative care focuses not on {{treating}} the underlying cancer, but on treating {{symptoms such as}} pain or nausea, and can assist in decision-making, including when or if hospice care will be beneficial. [...] Pain can be managed with medications such as opioids or through procedural intervention, by a nerve block on the celiac plexus (CPB). [...] This alters or, depending on the technique used, destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen. [...] CPB is a safe and effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> pain, which generally reduces the need to use opioid painkillers, which have significant negative side effects.|$|E

500|$|In an April 21, 1975, {{letter to}} Pinochet, Friedman {{considered}} the [...] "key economic problems of Chile are clearly... inflation {{and the promotion}} of a healthy social market economy". He stated that [...] "There is only one way to end inflation: by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money..." [...] and that [...] "...cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> fiscal deficit, because it... strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth". As to how rapidly inflation should be ended, Friedman felt that [...] "for Chile where inflation is raging at 10–20% a month... gradualism is not feasible. It would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive." [...] Choosing [...] "a brief period of higher unemployment..." [...] was the lesser evil.. and that [...] "the experience of Germany,... of Brazil..., of the post-war adjustment in the U.S.... all argue for shock treatment". In the letter Friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with [...] "...a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress" [...] and [...] "...for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal... to be taken as illustrative" [...] although his knowledge of Chile was [...] "too limited to enable [...] to be precise or comprehensive". He listed a [...] "sample proposal" [...] of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including [...] "the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market. For example, suspend... the present law against discharging employees". He closed, stating [...] "Such a shock program could end inflation in months". His letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes.|$|E

2500|$|One {{possible}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> {{number of}} inversions {{to only a}} few while obtaining {{a large number of}} samples is the application of the [...] so-called the Stochastic Collocation Monte Carlo sampler (SCMC sampler), within a polynomial chaos expansion framework, allows us the generation of any number of Monte Carlo samples based on only a few inversions of the original distribution and independent samples from a variable for which the inversions are analytically available, like for example the standard normal variable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C {{is much more}} common. The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes: ...|$|E
