The HER performance was enhanced further by incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the 3 D MoS 2 /Mo electrode, which facilitated better electron transfer through rGO. The onset potential of the MoS(2) rGO/ Mo was 100 mV (which is 20 mV lower than that of the MoS/Mo electrode) and it required 291 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(- 2).
