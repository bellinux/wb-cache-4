40|$|In today's semiconductor-based {{computer}} and communication technology, system performance is determined primarily by two factors, namely on-chip and off-chip operating frequency. In this dissertation, time-domain measurement-based methods that enable gigabit data transmission {{in both the}} IC and package have been proposed using Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) equipment. For {{the evaluation of the}} time-domain measurement-based method, a wafer level package test vehicle was designed, fabricated and characterized using the proposed measurement-based methods. Electrical issues associated with gigabit data transmission using the <b>wafer-level</b> <b>package</b> test vehicle were investigated. The test vehicle consisted of two board transmission lines, one silicon transmission line, and solder bumps with 50 um diameter and 100 um pitch. In this dissertation, 1) the frequency-dependent characteristic impedance and propagation constant of the transmission lines were extracted from TDR measurements. 2) Non-physical RLGC models for transmission lines were developed from the transient behavior for the simulation of the extracted characteristic impedance and propagation constant. 3) the solder bumps with 50 um diameter and 100 um pitch were analytically modeled. Then, the effect of the assembled <b>wafer-level</b> <b>package,</b> silicon substrate and board material, and material interfaces on gigabit data transmission were discussed using the <b>wafer-level</b> <b>package</b> test vehicle. Finally, design recommendations for the <b>wafer-level</b> <b>package</b> on integrated board were proposed for gigabit data transmission in both the IC and package. Ph. D.

Simultaneously, the electrical performance of these interconnections needs to be improved to support data rates in excess of 10 Gbps, while guaranteeing thermomechanical reliability and lowering the cost.

The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps.
