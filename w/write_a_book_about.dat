5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} him {{questions}} {{with the intent to}} <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> Earp. Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E

25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> him would {{definitely}} not be enough.

He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E

25|$|Foucault was in Tunis {{during the}} anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked {{the city in}} June 1967, and which {{continued}} for a year. Although {{highly critical of the}} violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte, Foucault started to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> the impressionist artist Eduard Manet, but never completed it.|$|E

25|$|Neville {{returned}} to Australia {{where he met}} his future partner, the journalist Julie Clarke. He began work on a new magazine, The Living Daylights, reporting on youth cultures, social inventions, and {{the shape of the}} future. He was a regular broadcaster on ABC Radio and wrote for an array of newspapers and magazines. He moved to New York City in 1977 to join Clarke, and wrote for The New York Times, New York magazine, and The Village Voice. Due to his experience on the hippie trail, publishers Random House commissioned Neville to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> a serial killer who preyed upon Western backpackers, incarcerated in New Delhi, India. The resulting biography of Charles Sobhraj, co-authored by Clarke, was a global best-seller. It inspired several TV drama documentaries, including Shadow of the Cobra.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, aged 39, Ranjitsinhji {{returned}} to England and played once more. Although announcing himself available {{to play for}} England in that season's Test matches, he was not selected. Restricted for a period by a wrist injury, he nevertheless scored four centuries, including one against the touring Australian team. At times, his form briefly touched that of his best years but most of his cricket was played in the South of England. He scored 1,113 runs at 42.81, placing him eighth in the averages. Ranjitsinhji's last first-class cricket came in 1920; having lost an eye in a hunting accident, he played only three matches and found he could not focus on the ball properly. Possibly prompted by embarrassment at his performance, he later claimed his sole motivation for returning was to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> batting with one eye; such a book was never published.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015 Sara Schätzl {{published}} {{her second}} book Hungriges Herz , {{in which she}} describes her twelve-year-long fight against bulimia. Her illness began when she was fourteen years old suffering from low self-esteem. After she was hospitalized twice in 2014, once diagnosed with life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, she decided to start a therapy and join a support group in Los Angeles. In {{the last months of}} her therapy Schätzl used her diary notes, together with records from her mother and friends, to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> her life with the eating disorder and her battle to escape the addiction. After Hungriges Herz became a bestseller in Germany Schätzl started in May 2015 a project on Kickstarter to collect $35000 to produce a short documentary film, ADDICT, based on the book and show the film for free in schools to discuss the problem of eating disorders with young people. The project ended on 21 May 2015 unsuccessfully.|$|E
