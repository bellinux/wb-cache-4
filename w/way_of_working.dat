While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had to consider that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; {{this was a very}} different <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> than the one he uses when composing for games.|$|E
5|$|Yang and Hunt {{distance}} themselves from {{each other as they}} keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.|$|E

40|$|Technology has fostered many {{alternative}} <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> {{which have}} {{changed the way we}} work and the way we use the built environment. Whilst most <b>of</b> these alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> offer tangible benefits to companies that have properly adopted them, poor implementation has caused losses that have slowed down the process of adoption. This paper recognises the benefits <b>of</b> adopting alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working,</b> but also warns about the fragility <b>of</b> <b>working</b> environments. A well planned adoption process is required in order to ensure implementation success. Based on strategic asset management together with Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, a method is proposed to accelerate the adoption process <b>of</b> alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> whilst keeping the balance between people, space and technology...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{work and}} {{knowledge}} work productivity {{have been studied}} for several years without achieving a consensus {{on how to improve}} it. One of the reasons is that the work practices and methods are based on traditional <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> originating from the industrial era. Such <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> are not applicable in our contemporary knowledge economy, hence {{there is a need for}} innovative ways to improve knowledge work productivity. ‘New <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> working’ offers a novel approach to tackle the issue. The main objective of this research was to examine how new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> affect knowledge work productivity and thus to ascertain how new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> could improve knowledge work productivity. This study entails two aspects: work environment consisting of three dimensions (physical, virtual, and social) and work practices (such as flexible and mobile work). This study incorporated both a theoretical and an empirical approach. The theoretical part focused on understanding the dynamics of knowledge work, knowledge work productivity and new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> The empirical part took the form of a qualitative case study with two case companies, Rapal Oy and Granlund Oy. The empirical material was gathered from 18 thematic interviews. As a result, the impacts of the work environment and work practices were identified in both cases. The potential <b>of</b> new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> to improve knowledge work productivity was analyzed resulting in three most important aspects in both cases. Most of the key findings of this study corroborated those of earlier studies. However, this research emphasized the significance of the social environment and work practices as regards productivity. New <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> were considered to affect, for example, work flow, time efficiency, knowledge sharing, and more intangible aspects, such as job satisfaction and motivation. However, the impact on the work-life balance was perceived to be a rather complex issue, since both positive and negative impacts emerged In conclusion, this research increases the understanding of the relationship between new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> and employee productivity, offering a comprehensive view on the matter...|$|R

25|$|Jill Purce (born 1947) is a British voice teacher, Family Constellations therapist, and author. Purce {{developed}} in the 1970s a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> with the voice, introducing the teaching worldwide of group overtone chanting, producing a single note whilst amplifying the vocal harmonics. She is a former fellow of King's College London, Biophysics Department. She produced over 30 books as General Editor of the Thames and Hudson Art and Imagination series. Between 1971 and 1974 she worked in Germany with the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Since the early 1970s she has taught internationally diverse forms of contemplative chant, and especially overtone chanting.

40|$|Objective of the Study: The aim of {{this case}} {{study was to explore}} and {{describe}} the nature of and relationship between internal communication and new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> Although information technology has been a central part of work in organizations for decades, it is only recently that work has become truly mobile and organizations have started implementing strategies and solutions that allow employees to work anywhere and anytime. The overall research problem of this thesis was: What is the nature of internal communication in an organization utilizing new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working?</b> This research problem is explored through two specifying research questions: (1) How is strategy communicated in an organization utilizing new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working?</b> (2) How is internal communication perceived in an organization utilizing new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working?</b> Theoretical Framework and Methodology: As the successful adoption <b>of</b> new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> incorporates human resources, information technology and corporate real estate practices and is therefore not a phenomenon easily related to merely one science field, an interdisciplinary approach was considered appropriate for the study. The theoretical framework of the thesis was for the most part influenced by Juholin's (2007 a) agenda model of organizational communication but also drew on interdisciplinary research with background in, for instance, communications, facilities management research and organizational studies. The research design used in the thesis was of descriptive and exploratory nature and utilized both a quantitative and a qualitative research strategy. The research method was a single-case study, and the data was collected with a survey and semi-structured focus group interviews. The analysis methods used to analyze the data were content analysis and descriptive statistical analysis using the SPSS software. Findings and Conclusions: The adoption <b>of</b> alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> poses various demands to communication: more justified technology choices are necessary, systematic guidelines should be established, and communication responsibilities ought to be declared. The main findings of the thesis are related to the design and nature of internal communication about strategy: it is argued that to motivate and commit employees, it is essential to avoid vagueness and emphasize inspirational aspects in communication, especially when employees are dispersed and work autonomously. The study proposes an internal communication approach for organizations utilizing new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> It is concluded that a comparative research including several organizations would give more insight into the phenomenon <b>of</b> new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> that was very slow, and the Ramones had their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles was {{recorded}} between 30 May and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios in London, with some sessions at Trident Studios. The group block-booked time at Abbey Road through to July, and their times at Rishikesh were soon {{forgotten in the}} atmosphere of the studio, with sessions occurring at irregular hours. The group's self-belief that they could do anything {{led to the formation of}} a new multimedia business corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects. The open-ended studio time led to a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as had happened in previous sessions, the group would simply record all the rehearsals and jamming, then add overdubs to the best take. Harrison's song [...] "Not Guilty" [...] was left off the album despite recording 102 takes.|$|E

500|$|Massenet was a {{prolific}} composer; he put this {{down to his}} <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working,</b> rising early and composing from four {{o'clock in the morning}} until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 {{and was one of the}} first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: [...] "M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success." ...|$|E
500|$|Hordern {{first met}} the British theatre {{director}} Jonathan Miller in 1968. Miller, {{who had long}} been an admirer of Hordern, offered him {{the part of the}} agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama Whistle and I'll Come to You. Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. [...] He came to like Miller's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working,</b> such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it [...] "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for The Telegraph, writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the [...] "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [...] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in Peter Hall's production of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of The Spectator thinking Hordern was [...] "ill-served" [...] as the principal character, Tobias.|$|E
500|$|Black & White {{took over}} three years to develop {{beginning}} on 14 February 1998, and was released on 30 March 2001. Peter Molyneux funded the project himself and devoted his entire focus to its development. Molyneux stated {{that he tried to}} correct the mistakes he made with the game design of Dungeon Keeper. The goal was to develop a unique game where players felt they inhabited a world where they could do anything. Molyneux had liked the idea of controlling people as a god since his previous venture, Populous. He was interested in the concept of good and evil and thought that this could be used to influence the game's atmosphere. Development was slow, starting with only six people, as Molyneux wanted to assemble the right team. Discussions about concepts (including a Mafia-style game) began at his house in 1997, and in February 1998, the team moved into Lionhead's offices. The expanded nine-person team exchanged further suggestions for the game and its content, such as lip-synchronised characters, although this was thought impossible. As more people joined, Molyneux wanted Lionhead's friendly atmosphere to remain, and their policy of only recruiting people who could fit in with existing members meant that the team had developed their own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> According to Molyneux, team members questioned and competed with each other, resulting in a better quality of work. He said that [...] "the team did the work of a group twice their number." [...] The group that finally numbered twenty-five programmers with a budget of approximately £4 million.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s in the studio with us, because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis aims {{to suggest}} {{the ways in which}} people will work in the future and how {{organizations}} can develop their physical spaces to support and adapt to their employees’ future <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> The study hypothesizes that employees’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> will be greatly affected by information technology, primarily tools {{that will allow them to}} communicate and collaborate both across the hall and across the globe. The question is: By 2022, what will the physical elements of the workplace be like in an organization with global presence? To answer this question, the study used three qualitative research methods: literature review, scenario planning and case study. The scope of the research study was limited to Statoil, a Norwegian oil and gas company with global presence. The use of Statoil corporate scenarios enabled the study to suggest Statoil’s future <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working,</b> but limited the results’ validity to this organization, without the ability to generalize. Among the findings is the fact that the workplace consists of social, virtual and physical spaces, which are dependent on one another. Employees will probably work in different places - office buildings, satellite offices, their homes, cafes - depending on their needs and preferences. As such, office buildings will be more social hubs, because despite the advances in virtual communication, physical interaction will still matter. A case study shows that Statoil could arrange physical spaces to best support existing work practices by providing these facilities: privacy rooms, team arenas, interplay rooms, study rooms and playstation areas. The research recommends that in order to increase collaborative capabilities in the future, Statoil should design more collaborative work spaces to support new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working.</b> Rather than requiring employees to adapt to the physical space, organizations should take a more holistic approach to office space design so that it easily adapts to employees’ future <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>working...</b>|$|R
