50|$|Nowadays cul-de-sacs {{are often}} frowned upon in <b>planning</b> <b>circles,</b> {{especially}} by {{supporters of the}} New Urbanism: they do not permit higher densities, are car-dependent, and unlike grid systems, do not lend themselves to redevelopment and change.

The regulation of each type of product group had been preceded by an expert study (preparatory study), which had been afterwards scrutinized intensively in a stakeholder process.|$|R

40|$|A team {{of agents}} is jointly {{able to achieve}} a goal if despite any {{incomplete}} knowledge they may have about the world or each other, they still know {{enough to be able}} to get to a goal state. Unlike in the single-agent case, the mere existence of a <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> is not enough as there may be several incompat-ible <b>working</b> <b>plans</b> and the agents may not be able to choose a share that coordinates with the others’. Some formalizations of joint ability ignore this issue of coordination within a coali-tion. Others, including those based on game theory, deal with coordination, but require a complete specification of agents’ beliefs. Such a complete specification is often not available. Here we present a new formalization of joint ability based on logical entailment in the situation calculus that avoids both of these pitfalls...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of building materials {{plays a key}} role in the achievement of the ‘Green Buildings’ target and is performed both at an early stage of the design process (when general and strategic choices concerning the building are made) and at the <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> (when materials available on the market are selected). The latter aspect is important exactly as the first one for the actual fulfilment of ‘greenness’ requirements, but architects and engineers in charge of this choice often lack of evaluation tools supporting them in materials’ selection. In the present paper, after a brief discussion about the critical aspects of the definition of ‘green building materials’, the tools presently available for the {{selection of}} building materials are overviewed and discussed, with particular attention to the selection of materials at the <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> stage. The applicability of such tools is therefore discussed, with particular reference to the Italian market...|$|R

He later left the Association following disagreements with them over the best means of educating people about sexuality and contraception. Storer wrote a number of sex education books in the 1920s and '30s, which were notable for their accepting attitude to human sexuality, including homosexuality and bisexuality. Storer's sexual encounters with men were the subject of tabloid newspaper stories and court actions.|$|R
40|$|The forest {{planning}} {{understood as}} mere management of stands for wood production has currently lost, {{compared to the}} past, its relevance and application possibilities; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} focus on the multifunctional services of forests. Here we present a synthesis of a district forest plan which has been developed through five pillars: (a) mapping of potential forest ecosystem services, (b) involving local stakeholders and experts, (c) exploring strategic scenarios of forest yield, (d) mapping homogeneous forest zones, and (e) capitalising the knowledge of forest <b>working</b> <b>plans.</b> The experts contributed through a decision support system NetSyMoD (Network Analysis-Creative System Modelling-Decision Support) which helps the decision process in the assessment of the scenarios of forest yield. It was possible to appreciate that an increase of yield suits well to climate adaptation in some forest zone and with the contents of forest <b>working</b> <b>plans.</b> This approach may be replicated in other forest districts where there is an history in the application of silvicultural control methods...|$|R
