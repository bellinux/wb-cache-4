40|$|This Article {{discusses}} recent proposals {{aimed at}} unifying {{the law of}} <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> nonprobate transfers. The author notes that default rules of construction present the strongest case for unification, but contends that distinctions between <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> nonprobate transfers remain important {{in the areas of}} formalities and restrictions affecting third-party rights. The author concludes that the policy goal should be to allow <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> nonprobate transfers to operate smoothly as complementary methods of deathtime wealth transmission...|$|R
