5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a card transaction is £3 <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the cost for a single ticket.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, initial {{reception}} by Manchester City supporters was polarised, {{with some}} lukewarm about moving from Maine Road {{which had a}} reputation for being one of English football's most atmospheric grounds, whilst others were enthusiastic about the bigger stadium and move back to East Manchester where the club was formed. Since 2010, the club has boasted more than 36,000 season ticket holders each season, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the 35,150 maximum capacity of Maine Road just before the club moved homes.|$|E

5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This {{is due to the}} very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $51.1million on its five-day {{opening weekend}} (June 27 – July 1, 2012) from 13 markets, with strong {{openings}} in many Asian countries. In India, it earned $6.0million, a record opening for a Hollywood film. Its final box office collection in India was $20 million {{making it the}} eightth highest grossing Hollywood film in India of all time. Kercy Daruwala of Sony Pictures in India felt very confident {{that the presence of}} famed Indian actor Irrfan Khan would enhance attendance. Opening in an additional 61 markets, the film made $127.5million over its second weekend. The movie ranked number one in over 30 countries. In Indonesia, it broke the opening-weekend record with $4.5million while, in the UK, it opened to £11.1 million ($18.1million) which is about equal with Spider-Man 3 (£11.8 million). In its last market, China, The Amazing Spider-Man grossed $33.3 million over its seven-day debut, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Spider-Man 3’s lifetime box office in China. China is also the movie's highest-grossing territory with $48.8 million.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{three times}} {{the age of the}} universe of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E

5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be {{a percentage of the}} total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E
