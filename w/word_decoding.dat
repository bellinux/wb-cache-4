5000|$|Reading {{disorder}} {{is the most}} common learning disability. Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70-80% have deficits in reading. The term [...] "Developmental Dyslexia" [...] is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, <b>word</b> <b>decoding,</b> reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension.

McNeill, Gillon, & Dodd studied 12 children ages 4-7 with DVD/CAS who were treated with this approach 2x a week for two 6-week blocks of time (separated by a 6-week withdrawal block). They found positive effects for most {{of the children in the}} areas of speech production, phonological awareness, <b>word</b> <b>decoding,</b> letter knowledge, and spelling. These results show that it is clinically productive to target speech production, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, spelling, and reading all at once.

5000|$|Dyslexia is a {{learning}} disability that manifests itself as a difficulty with <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and/or reading fluency.

It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate reading instruction. It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5-17% of the population. Dyslexia has been proposed to have three cognitive subtypes (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by the underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.).

50|$|Working memory {{training}} {{is intended to}} improve a person's working memory. Working memory is a central intellectual faculty, linked to IQ, ageing, and mental health. It has been claimed that working memory training programs are effective means, not only for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognitive disorders, but to improve intelligence and to enhance cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults. 23 studies with 30 group comparisons, show that clinical memory training programs produce reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills in children and adults with ADHD. Yet, the study results differ with regard to conclusive evidence that such effects can be maintained long-term without additional follow-up training. There is also no convincing evidence {{of the effect of}} working memory training to other skills such as nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, <b>word</b> <b>decoding,</b> and arithmetic. While most studies show clinical relevance of working memory training programs for ADHD population, they cast doubt that these program should be considered as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in children and adults without working memory deficiencies.|$|E
5000|$|The 1921 Journal of Educational Research {{contains}} Fernald's foundational {{study of}} four boys who learn to spell and read by her kinesthetic method. This method influenced other researchers {{working at the}} same time in the field of reading difficulties. Notable examples include Samuel Orton and Anna Gillingham. The article in the Journal of Educational Research, [...] "The Effect of Kinaesthetic Factors in the Development of Word Recognition in the Case of Non-Readers", outlines five phases of the kinesthetic method. With an emphasis on student choice, focal words are generated by the students during the first stage. Each word is introduced by the teacher who writes it on the chalkboard. The student repeats the word while tracing it on the board. When the student is confident that he knows the word, he attempts to write it while saying each syllable. Successful word study is followed by phase two where sentences are created in a similar fashion. The third step incorporates a student-selected book where words from specific paragraphs are isolated for reading. In the fourth phase, the student is asked to read whole phrases from the paragraphs. Finally, the student is encouraged to do silent reading on his own for the fifth phase. After some time all four boys successfully learned to read well enough to perform at grade level. Follow-ups with the participants reflected the maintenance of reading levels and for some avid readers, additional leaps in reading proficiency. Though not asserting widespread generalizability, Fernald and Keller enumerate several findings. One conclusion of interest today describes each student learning by analogy, demonstrating the [...] "ability to pronounce new words if they resemble words he has already learned." [...] This is a compensatory strategy currently used.Warren's 1977 dissertation study with children exhibiting mild forms of reading problems demonstrated 147% and 77% superior word recognition and comprehension respectively by Fernald tracing compared to Orton-Gillingham phonics, although O-G was 10% more effective in <b>word</b> <b>decoding.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although {{evidence}} suggests that individual differences in reading and mathematics skills are correlated, this relationship has typically only been studied in relation to <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> or global measures of reading.

The current study examined these relationships at both a phenotypic and etiological level in a population-based cohort of 5162 twin pairs at age 12. Multivariate genetic analyses of latent phenotypic factors of mathematics, <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and reading comprehension revealed substantial genetic and shared environmental correlations among all three domains. However, the phenotypic and genetic correlations between mathematics and reading comprehension were significantly greater than between mathematics and <b>word</b> <b>decoding.</b> Independent of mathematics, there was also evidence for genetic and nonshared environmental links between <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and reading comprehension.

40|$|The present {{longitudinal}} study aimed {{to investigate the}} development of <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> skills during incremental phonics instruction in Dutch as a transparent orthography. A representative sample of 973 Dutch children {{in the first grade}} (M age  =  6; 1, SD =  0; 5) was exposed to incremental subsets of Dutch grapheme-phoneme correspondences during 6 consecutive blocks of 3  weeks of phonics instruction. Children's accuracy and efficiency of curriculum embedded <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> were assessed after each incremental block, followed by a standardized <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> measurement.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of cognitive and language skills as predictors of early literacy skills in children with Specific Language Impairment.

Structural equation modeling showed <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> to be predicted by speech, short-term memory, and phonological awareness, whereas reading comprehension was predicted by <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> skills and short-term memory. It can be concluded that in children with SLI variations in early <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> are mostly determined by speech abilities and short-term memory, and to a lesser extent by phonological awareness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the role of gender and linguistic diversity in the growth of Dutch <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> skills throughout elementary school for a representative sample of children living in the Netherlands. Following a longitudinal design, the children's decoding abilities for (1) regular CVC words, (2) complex monosyllabic words with consonant clusters in prevocalic and postvocalic position, and (3) polysyllabic words were assessed on two occasions during every grade. The results showed substantial growth across grade for all of the <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> measures. Growth curve analyses showed a quadratic rather than a linear growth curve to optimally model the children's <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> development. Small but significant effects of gender and linguistic diversity were observed: Girls generally did better than boys — mainly on the regular CVC word patterns. And children learning to read in Dutch as a first language generally did better than children learning to read Dutch as a second language — mainly on polysyllabic words. From a structural point of view, the development of <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> in the different subgroups turned out to be highly comparable.

40|$|Specific {{effects of}} <b>word</b> <b>decoding,</b> {{vocabulary}} and listening comprehension abilities {{on the development}} of reading comprehension were longitudinally examined for a representative sample of 2143 Dutch children throughout the elementary school period. An attempt was made to test two theoretical frameworks for the prediction of the development of reading comprehension: the lexical quality hypothesis in which <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and vocabulary are assumed to be critical determinants of reading comprehension and the simple reading view in which reading comprehension is assumed to be the product of <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and listening comprehension. The results showed significant progress across grades on all of the predictor and criterion measures. The stability of the measures was also high across time, which shows the individual differences between students to remain across grades. <b>Word</b> <b>decoding</b> exerted a substantial effect on early reading comprehension and a small effect on later sixth grade reading comprehension. The data provide empirical support for the lexical quality hypothesis as they show knowledge of word forms and word meanings (i. e. vocabulary) to predict the development of reading comprehension. Support for the simple reading view was also found in that <b>word</b> <b>decoding</b> and listening comprehension significantly predicted reading comprehension as well. A combined structural model with <b>word</b> <b>decoding,</b> vocabulary and listening comprehension as predictors of reading comprehension showed a substantial impact of the three predictors on reading comprehension at first grade. In subsequent grades, vocabulary is still predicting reading comprehension directly whereas listening comprehension shows a reciprocal relationship with vocabulary.
