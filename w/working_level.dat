25|$|A common unit of {{exposure}} of lung tissue to alpha emitters is the <b>working</b> <b>level</b> month (WLM), {{this is where}} the human lungs have been exposed for 170 hours (a typical month worth of work for a miner) to air which has 3.7 kBq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products). This is air which has the alpha dose rate of 1 <b>working</b> <b>level</b> (WL). It is estimated that the average person (general public) is subject to 0.2 WLM per year, which works out at about 15 to 20 WLM in a lifetime. According to the NRC 1 WLM is a 5 to 10 mSv lung dose (0.5 to 1.0 rem), while the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) consider that 1 WLM is equal to a lung dose of 5.5 mSv, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) consider 1 WLM to be a 5 mSv lung dose for professional workers (and 4 mSv lung dose for the general public). Lastly the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) consider that the exposure of the lungs to 1 Bq of 222Rn (in equilibrium with its decay products) for one year will cause a dose of 61 μSv.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to report}} {{the results of an}} {{investigation}} of the relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>level,</b> measured by the cash conversion cycle and profitability of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The paper employs panel data regression analysis on a sample of 160 Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed SMEs for the period from 2005 to 2010. The empirical results show that there is a concave relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> and firm profitability and that there is an optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> at which firms’ profitability is maximised. Furthermore, an examination {{as to whether or not}} deviations from the optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> reduce firm profitability indicate that deviations above or below the optimum decrease profitability. The sample is limited to AIM listed SMEs, and therefore the findings cannot be generalised to all firms. Overall, the evidence suggests that firms should strive and attain the optimal <b>working</b> capital <b>level</b> in order to maximise their profitability. The results are of importance to both SMEs and policy makers providing insight into the nature of cash conversion cycle and its relationship to SMEs profitability...|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade Smith's Shaft was sunk to the 40Fathom Level, the 60Fathom Level, and in 1899 to the 75Fathom Level. In 1896 it was fitted with cages and an {{electric}} winding engine, and the old Lucy Engine Shaft was abandoned in 1899. By 1902 all ore production from above the Lucy Level had ceased. In 1904 Smith's Shaft was extended to the 90Fathom Level which became the major <b>working</b> <b>level</b> for many years. A small patch of ore above {{the north end of}} the Lucy Tongue Level was opened up in the 1890s, known as the Alma Workings. [...] Gelignite was introduced in the 1890s, replacing both blasting gelatine and gunpowder.

If we can produce evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, {{we may be able}} to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk." [...] Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe <b>working</b> <b>level</b> of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed [...] "the snow trees" [...] due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.|$|E

2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a <b>working</b> <b>level</b> and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, {{but there was no way}} to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E

50|$|The mining {{industry}} traditionally measures exposure using the <b>working</b> <b>level</b> (WL) index, and the cumulative exposure in <b>working</b> <b>level</b> months (WLM): 1 WL equals {{any combination of}} short-lived 222Rn progeny (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, and 214Po) in 1 liter of air that releases 1.3 × 105 MeV of potential alpha energy; one WL is equivalent to 2.08 × 10−5 joules per cubic meter of air (J/m3). The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J·h/m3). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6 × 10−3 J·h/m3.

40|$|Rapidly cooling firefighters post {{emergency}} response {{is likely to}} increase the operational effectiveness of fire services during prolonged incidents. A variety of techniques have therefore been examined to return firefighters core body temperature to safe levels prior to fire scene re-entry or redeployment. The recommendation of forearm immersion (HFI) in cold water by the National Fire and Protection Association preceded implementation of this active cooling modality by a number of fire services in North America, South East Asia and Australia. The vascularity of the hands and forearms may expedite body heat removal, however, immersion of the torso, pelvis and/or lower body, otherwise known as multi-segment immersion (MSI), exposes a greater proportion of the body surface to water than HFI, potentially increasing the rates of cooling conferred. Therefore, this review sought to establish the efficacy of HFI and MSI to rapidly reduce firefighters core body temperature to safe <b>working</b> <b>levels</b> during rest periods. A total of 38 studies with 55 treatments (43 MSI, 12 HFI) were reviewed. The core body temperature cooling rates conferred by MSI were generally classified as ideal (n = 23) with a range of ~ 0. 01 to 0. 35 °C min− 1. In contrast, all HFI treatments resulted in unacceptably slow core body temperature cooling rates (~ 0. 01 to 0. 05 °C min− 1). Based upon the extensive field of research supporting immersion of large body surface areas and comparable logistics of establishing HFI or MSI, it is recommended that fire and rescue management reassess their approach to fireground rehabilitation of responders. Specifically, we question the use of HFI to rapidly lower firefighter core body temperature during rest periods. By utilising MSI to restore firefighter Tc to safe <b>working</b> <b>levels,</b> fire and rescue services would adopt an evidence based approach to maintaining operational capability during arduous, sustained responses. While the optimal MSI protocol will be determined by the specifics of an individual response, maximising the body surface area immersed in circulated water of up to 26 °C for 15 min is likely to return firefighter Tc to safe <b>working</b> <b>levels</b> during rest periods. Utilising cooler water temperatures will expedite Tc cooling and minimise immersion duration...|$|R
