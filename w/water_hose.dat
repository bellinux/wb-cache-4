5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a <b>water</b> <b>hose,</b> which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5000|$|Green Slime Transfer Truck: A {{truck that}} {{featured}} <b>water</b> <b>hoses,</b> video screens, and various levers and buttons triggering water bursts. The truck was also added at the Nickelodeon Studios, but was {{different than the}} one at Splat City (minus <b>water</b> <b>hoses</b> and video screens). The one at the Studios {{was used as a}} setting for U-Dip segments on Nick in the Afternoon, the one at Splat City looked similar to the Studios' Slime Geyser.|$|R
25|$|The Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim {{announced}} that police used <b>water</b> <b>hoses</b> to disperse the campers. Yet, all videos and {{photos from the}} scenes of the raids never showed <b>water</b> or <b>hoses.</b> Tents and bodies were on fire, and the main mosque of Rabaa Al-Adawiya was burned with hundreds of unidentified bodies.|$|R

25|$|In 1978, Mackey and Renee Lawson {{borrowed}} $45,000 {{from family}} and friends to open a small vegetarian natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When the two were evicted from their apartment for storing food products in it, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> attached to their dishwasher.|$|E
25|$|Breathing gases may be {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} through a diver's umbilical, or airline hose, which provides breathing gas, communications and a safety line, with options for a hot <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> for heating, a video cable and gas reclaim line. The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following the umbilical. Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also has serious disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by {{the length of the}} umbilical, and it may snag on obstructions.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} mini-games available, for example: planting seeds/saplings; watering plants; cutting off or removing weak/dead parts of plants; shooing away pests and rodents; harvesting produce; and making rainbows using a <b>watering</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Polybutadiene rubber {{may be used}} in {{the inner}} tube of hoses for sandblasting, along with natural rubber. The main idea is to {{increase}} resilience. This rubber can also be used in the cover of hoses, mainly pneumatic and <b>water</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Inflatable water slides are {{designed}} for the home user. They are typically made of a thick strong PVC or vinyl and nylon, and are inflated using an electric or gasoline powered blower. The water slide {{is attached to a}} <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> in order to generate the supply of water. There are small sized inflatable water slides for private house uses or larger inflatable water slides for school, picnic, corporate, or carnival style use. There are also swimming pool water slides which users can set up to slide straight into a pool. Most parks avoid this due to safety concerns, and will have swimming sections in a separate pool.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} explosion, Samuel Huntington settled to the bottom, {{but because the}} bottom had been only [...] below her keel, most of the ship {{remained}} above the water. U.S. Navy salvage ship [...] came alongside the Huntington and trained two deck water guns and a [...] <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> to douse the fires. When the task seemed accomplished, Weight pulled away. The fires flared up again four hours later and Weight returned to fight the conflagration again. After tending to other ships damaged during the raid, Weight returned a third time. By {{the early morning hours}} on 30 January, any hope of salvaging Samuel Huntington or her cargo ended when the fires reached her load of canned gasoline. The resulting explosion completely destroyed the ship and again rained shrapnel on nearby ships. When the smoke cleared, no trace of the Huntington remained.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{requests}} {{the help}} of Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) in caring for his ailing Aunt Shirley. Angela initially refuses, but gives in when Dwight begins describing her ailments in grotesque detail. At the house, Angela is horrified by Dwight's treatment of his Aunt: he consistently speaks {{to her in a}} condescending tone, proposes to cut off her worn-out clothing with a utility knife, and [...] "bathes" [...] her by spraying her with a high-pressure <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> like a cow. After subduing Dwight by spraying him with the hose, Angela insists on washing and grooming Shirley in a more dignified manner. Through the process, Dwight and Angela recall their feelings for each other. At the end of the day, they begin kissing, but Angela reminds Dwight that she is married and says she will not leave her husband even though he does not care for her. Dwight admits that he would want that same blind loyalty from her if she were his wife.|$|E
50|$|Street {{sweepers}} {{have been}} employed in cities since sanitation and waste removal became a priority. A street-sweeping person {{would use a}} broom and shovel to clean off litter, animal waste and filth that accumulated on streets. Later, <b>water</b> <b>hoses</b> were used to wash the streets.|$|R
2500|$|Several semi-theatrical events {{around the}} [...] "invasion" [...] have become traditional. Beginning in 1956, a small US Navy ship would {{volunteer}} to be [...] "attacked" [...] by small boats of the [...] "Ybor City Navy" [...] armed with stale Cuban bread and <b>water</b> <b>hoses.</b> The US Navy returned [...] "fire" [...] {{with their own}} <b>water</b> <b>hoses</b> but would eventually surrender to the Alcalde of Ybor City, who had, as the story goes, been hired by Jose Gaspar to clear resistance to his impending pirate attack. After the [...] "battle", the navy sailors would be treated to an evening on the town. This event was temporarily discontinued after the September 11, 2001 attacks, but has been held sporadically since, with the museum ship SS American Victory usually standing in for the US Navy.|$|R

500|$|On graduation, Born {{was obliged}} to perform his {{military}} service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons [...] "Empress Alexandra of Russia", which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, George Searle and Joseph Larmor. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers [...] "Great Elector" [...] until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked {{under the supervision of}} Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A minor accident involving Born's black body experiment, a ruptured cooling <b>water</b> <b>hose,</b> and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} several {{male and female}} models dressed up as {{soldiers}} on a fashion runway, wearing military garb and gas masks with one male model sports a shirt that reads [...] "Fashion Victim" [...] while it is inter-cut with scenes of Madonna singing {{in front of a}} black background. In the second chorus, middle-eastern children are seen walking on the runway, and being bullied by the soldier models. During the bridge, Madonna and her group prepare to enter the runway in a restroom, while she carves [...] "Protect Me" [...] on the partition of a stall and dances angrily with them to the song. The women also are seen dancing in front of surveillance cameras. When the rap section starts, Madonna is seen crashing into the show driving a Mini Cooper and pummel the photographers with an industrial-strength <b>water</b> <b>hose,</b> while rapping and dancing on top of the car with her gang. In the end of the video, Madonna frantically drives out of the runway into the amused audience, and pull a hand grenade with her teeth and then throws it to George W. Bush, and the video ends with him using it to light up his cigar.|$|E
500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Worker Sabotage" [...] {{point of}} view argues {{that it was not}} {{physically}} possible for the water to enter the tank without concerted human effort, and that extensive testimony and engineering analysis leads to a conclusion that water entered the tank when a rogue individual employee hooked a <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> directly to an empty valve {{on the side of the}} tank. This {{point of view}} further argues that the Indian government took extensive actions to hide this possibility in order to attach blame to UCC.|$|E
