[...] The measure was defeated 60-31. [...] In the final count, thirty-two Republicans voted for the revised Bricker Amendment and fourteen voted against.|$|E

5000|$|According to Romero, the deathmatch {{concept was}} {{inspired}} by fighting games. At id Software, the team frequently played Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting during breaks, while developing elaborate rules involving trash-talk and smashing furniture or tech. Romero stated that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> something that invented deathmatch" [...] and that [...] "Japanese fighting games fueled the creative impulse to create deathmatch in our shooters." ...|$|R
500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, {{and we went}} sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> it.... When <b>we</b> put that record out, <b>we</b> knew what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> illegal, but <b>we</b> thought it <b>was</b> gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So {{the first thing that}} shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|R
2500|$|Despite its effectiveness, Whittlesey {{says the}} Outreach Group {{was shut down}} in 1985 when Donald Regan took over as Chief of Staff and the White House [...] "started the brown bag {{operation}} with Ollie North. What <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> completely open and above board. It was an honest effort to change minds and hearts {{and to provide a}} forum for truth telling". According to Whittlesey, [...] "the Washington establishment, especially Democratic but also most of the Republican, was opposed to, wanted to downplay, or gave the silent treatment to Reagan's Central American anti-communist policies." ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 1999, the [...] removed two books, {{one being}} Bless Me, Ultima, from teacher Carol Bennett’s English classes. The removal was {{proposed}} by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett's {{students about the}} violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board's action: “What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> {{trying to protect the}} children. And you got a teacher that’s trying to do what we do not think is right”. All copies of Bless Me, Ultima were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal’s office.|$|E
2500|$|Uday Shankar, CEO of STAR India, {{suggested}} Aamir Khan {{to venture}} into television. Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we knew what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> different, but it comes straight from our heart."

5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} because what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> {{in such a}} long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> influenced by. <b>We</b> didn't start a genre. We contributed to {{a long line of}} fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|R

500|$|In 1988, Namath and Madden, by {{then both}} {{television}} analysts, were interviewed for the 20th {{anniversary of the}} Heidi Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the Heidi Game [...] "was kind of {{the start of the}} Raiders being a great team. One of the things <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> getting these fantastic come-from-behind things...We didn't even know about the Heidi thing until we read about it the next day."

2500|$|... ith hindsight, I {{can see how}} if {{somebody}} got Led Zeppelin III, which was so different from what we'd done before, and they only had a short time to review it on the record player in the office, then they missed the content. They were in a rush and {{they were looking for}} the new [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] and not actually listening to what was there. It was too fresh for them and they didn't get the plot. So, in retrospect, it doesn't surprise me that the diversity and breadth of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> overlooked or under-appreciated at the time.|$|R
30|$|Along {{with mass}} {{casualty}} triage situations, care provision in disease outbreaks was also discussed by many participants as a context where attention to suffering was extremely challenging, yet necessary. While a few stories {{were related to}} outbreaks of cholera or other diseases, most were told about the 2014 – 15 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa to which seven of the participants had responded. In this setting, curative options were not available. A nurse reported, “when I started we had like a 70 % mortality rate, so basically all <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> palliative care, I mean <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just making people comfortable…at {{the end of their}} lives” (P 11).|$|R

A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards cut and run, Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|R

500|$|For the {{sequences}} {{involving the}} terraforming {{of the city}} Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized Esri's CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city.

The work <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights.

5000|$|Asked by Crains {{to recount}} a {{business}} mistake {{he had made}} and learned from, Cornwell recalled his founding of Central Europe Today “right after the Berlin Wall came down,” when “phone lines from Budapest to London were routed through somewhere else.” The {{problem was that the}} broadcast was routed through different European cities on different days, with no rhyme or reason, “so <b>we</b> had to <b>be</b> there {{every step of the way}} to wake up the operator in whatever country - but that <b>was</b> difficult because <b>we</b> never knew beforehand what country it would be....We had all the big things right, but this small little detail at the core of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> broken and so everything else broke as a result.” He learned from this experience that “you have to own, obsess and be paranoid about every single step.” ...|$|R
