5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is a town}} in Somerset, England, at {{the mouth}} of the River Parrett and Bridgwater Bay. Burnham was a small fishing village until the late 18th century, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to grow because of its {{popularity}} as a seaside resort. It forms part of the parish of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge and shares a town council with its neighbouring market town of Highbridge. According to the 2011 census the population of the parish (i.e. including Highbridge) was 19,576, of which the populations of the wards of Burnham Central and Burnham North, which made up most of the town, totalled 13,601.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> a turn to the east. There is a possibility that the depression completed a small loop between the downgrade and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Heliade {{published}} his first work, {{an essay on}} Romanian grammar, in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt (which {{was part of the}} Austrian Empire at the time), and, on April 20, 1829, began printing the Bucharest-based paper Curierul Românesc. This was the most successful of several attempts to create a local newspaper, something Golescu first attempted in 1828. Publishing articles in both Romanian and French, Curierul Românesc had, starting in 1836, its own literary supplement, under the title of Curier de Ambe Sexe; in print until 1847, it notably published one of Heliade's most famous poems, Zburătorul. Curierul Românesc was edited as a weekly, and later as a bimonthly, until 1839, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to be issued {{three or four times a}} week. Its best-known contributors were Heliade himself, Grigore Alexandrescu, Costache Negruzzi, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Ioan Catina, Vasile Cârlova, and Iancu Văcărescu.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{association}} with the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) was not made until about 1859 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> destroying potato crops {{in the region of}} Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid infestation by L. decemlineata.|$|E

5|$|Smallville was {{generally}} positively received <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began.</b> Former Superman star Christopher Reeve expressed {{approval for the}} series, making two guest appearances before his death. The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4million viewers. Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34million viewers per episode, with season two the highest-rated at 6.3million. By {{the end of its}} run, Smallville passed Stargate SG-1 as the longest-running North American science-fiction series. Since its first season, the series received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. Smallville spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly comic book, soundtrack recordings and series-related merchandise. All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4.

5|$|The 1801 census {{recorded}} the village's population as 537. In the early 19th century, the Tudor Quex House {{had to be}} demolished and a replacement manor house was built in its place. In 1818, the Waterloo Tower {{was built on the}} grounds of Quex Park. It is a bell tower built by the owner of Quex Park, John Powell Powell, who had an interest in change ringing. Waterloo Tower was the first twelve-bell tower in Kent. The village was a farming community until the late 19th century, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> to develop into a coastal resort. Birchington railway station was opened in 1863 and the Railway Hotel, now the Sea View Hotel pub, was opened in 1865. Station Road was subsequently built to serve as Birchington's main shopping street. Coast Guard cottages were built at Minnis Bay in the 1870s and the first shops appeared by the bay in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months {{of being on the}} defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the element of surprise <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E

5|$|The {{field in}} which the hoard was {{discovered}} was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> {{to be used for}} agriculture and settlement.

The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{conflicts}} between the king and the Scots, whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism. James, Charles's predecessor as King of Scotland, {{made it clear that}} he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English impositions on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637. This led to the First Bishops' War between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops' War with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1950s {{increased}} funding advanced {{the place of}} sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the {{humanities and social sciences}} were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under The McMaster University Act, 1957, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, and was the first university-based research reactor in the Commonwealth <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>began</b> operating in 1959.|$|E
