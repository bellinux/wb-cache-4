25|$|For each year, Miller {{wrote about}} ten {{or more of}} his {{favorite}} songs, providing analytical insights and placing the songs in context in the musical world of their era. Miller had kept annual countdown lists of his favorite records throughout his life, and his personal project of compiling those lists onto CDs evolved into a formal endeavor to explain what made those songs noteworthy, for {{what was then the}} last 50 years of recorded music. The writing process started in 2006, when Miller took a hiatus from music making after the release of <b>What</b> <b>If</b> <b>It</b> Works?. Portions of the book were serially published in draft form on Miller's official web site, where Miller responded to fan requests by writing about one year at a time, in random order.|$|E

[...] Kim Thompson {{described}} the book as [...] "the biggest 'if' in comics' history: <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been a success?" [...] Thompson speculated on what Kurtzman may have been capable of {{if he had not}} had to resort to teaching, illustration, and Little Annie Fanny. [...] Thompson called the book [...] "one of the [...] most stunning successes, and one of the field's most heartbreaking failures". [...] Kurtzman's self-portrait from the back cover of the book is used in connection with the Harvey Awards, named in Kurtzman's honor.|$|E

The reason to stop it sooner was not, [...] "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"... you forget what was going on at the time. We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E

500|$|Lachlan Kanoniuk, {{music critic}} for The Guardian, noted the [...] "bawdy" [...] jokes and anecdotes shared onstage by Madonna. He {{went on to}} {{describe}} the show as [...] "a weird mix of old vaudevillian-style, M15+, smut humour and bad wordplay; some jokes about clowns, sex jokes that were really quite bad but she had such great comedic delivery". Kanoniuk also compared the show to Prince's Piano & A Microphone Tour, and complimented her singing during [...] "Between the Bars", describing it as [...] "no costume changes, no highly synchronised dance moves, just Madonna playing an acoustic guitar and baring her soul on stage." [...] Francis Gibb from The Times found Madonna's performance during [...] "Intervention" [...] as an intimate and [...] "naked" [...] moment for the singer due to the legal battle. Jon Lisi from PopMatters observed that unlike the Rebel Heart Tour, Madonna had [...] "something to say" [...] with Tears of a Clown show. However he was confused whether Madonna was being vulnerable as a clown or {{it was a case}} of the singer [...] "trolling us". Citing the instance of singing [...] "Intervention" [...] for Rocco, Lisi explained that [...] "Of course she loves her son, but maybe this was less about her pain and more about the press’ exploitation of her pain. As the show got more intimate with each song and personal anecdote, a disturbing thought crept into my mind: <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was meant to be a joke?" [...] Lisi concluded that the show had the ability [...] "represent a transitional point in [...] career", although the purpose was still unclear.|$|E

2500|$|The other {{interview}} {{took place}} {{just as the}} Bond was being established. Being approached by Reitz, Schreiner objected {{to the fact that}} the Bond aimed ultimately to overthrow British rule and remove the British flag from South Africa. To this, Reitz replied: [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is so?" [...] Schreiner expostulated in the following terms: [...] "You do not suppose that that flag is going to disappear without a tremendous struggle and hard fighting?" [...] "Well, I suppose not, but even so, what of that?" [...] rejoined Reitz. [...] In the face of this testimony with reference to two of the most prominent of the Bond's promoters, it is impossible to deny that from its beginning the great underlying idea of the Bond was an independent South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Following the split, the {{remnants}} of the Irish Volunteers were often, and erroneously, referred to as the [...] "Sinn Féin Volunteers", or, by the British press, derisively as [...] "Shinners", after Arthur Griffith's political organisation Sinn Féin. Although the two organisations had some overlapping membership, there was no official connection between Griffith's then moderate Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The political stance of the remaining Volunteers was not always popular, and a 1,000-strong march led by Pearse through the garrison city of Limerick on Whit Sunday, 1915, was pelted with rubbish by a hostile crowd. Pearse explained the reason for the establishment of the new force when he said in May 1915: What if conscription be enforced on Ireland? What if a Unionist or a Coalition British Ministry repudiates the Home Rule Act? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> be determined to dismember Ireland?

2500|$|Once {{it became}} clear that Eccleston would decline to appear, Moffat turned to an {{alternative}} concept he had been formulating, featuring a [...] "mayfly Doctor" [...] who appears for a single episode, asking, [...] "Would it be weird in the run of the series to have the 45th Doctor turn up and be played by Johnny Depp or someone? Would that be a cool thing to do?". He also indicated that the [...] "classic Doctor" [...] he would most like to feature in a new story was William Hartnell's First Doctor, stating, [...] "You'd want him to come and say 'What in the name of God have I turned into?' That's the confrontation that you most want to see, to celebrate 50 years. Going round and round in circles on it I just thought, 'What about a Doctor that he never talks about?'

2500|$|The police department's {{handling}} of the Strauss-Kahn case was heavily criticized in his native France. Élisabeth Guigou, who as French minister of justice in 2000 had lobbied successfully for {{the passage of a}} law that forbids the publication of any images of an identifiable defendant in handcuffs who has not yet been convicted, criticized the walk, stating: [...] "I found that image to be incredibly brutal, violent and cruel...I don't see what the publication of images of this type adds." [...] Another former member of the French cabinet, Jack Lang, Minister of Culture in the early 1980s, likened the perp walk to a lynching. French Senator Jean-Pierre Chevènement, a longtime acquaintance of Strauss-Kahn's, wrote on his blog that [...] "The heart can only contract before these humiliating and poignant images...A horrible global lynching! And <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were all a monstrous injustice?" [...] The French newspaper Le Monde editorialized: [...] "When one of the world's most powerful men is turned over to press photos, coming out of a police station handcuffed, hands behind his back, he is already being subjected to a sentence which is specific to him...Is it necessary that a man's fame deprive him of his presumption of innocence in the media?
