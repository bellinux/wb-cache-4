[...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album. [...] The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album I can live with very very happily. [...] I like it very much." ...|$|E

[...] In June 1993 the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr Philip Hammond, resigned in protest to what he saw as contempt of the Scientific Committee's recommendations. The same year Norway became the only state in the world to resume commercial whaling, {{on the grounds that they}} had objected to, and thus opted out, of the moratorium.|$|E

2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zakaria {{initially}} {{supported the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. He {{said at the}} time, [...] "The place is so dysfunctional ... any stirring of the pot is good. America's involvement {{in the region is}} for the good." [...] He argued for a United Nations–sanctioned operation with a much larger force—approximately 400,000 troops—than was actually employed by the administration of President George W. Bush. However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the occupation of Iraq. He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the de-Baathification programs. He continued to argue that a functioning democracy in Iraq would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq surge in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops. He later wrote that the surge [...] "succeeded" [...] militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was very}} much to be member for Westminster. So much had at any rate been {{achieved}} by him who had begun the world without a shilling and without a friend,--almost without education! Much as he loved money, and much as he loved the spending of money, and much as he had made and much as he had spent, no triumph of his life had been so great to him as this. Brought into {{the world in a}} gutter, without father or mother, with no good thing ever done for him, he was now a member of the British Parliament, and member for one of the first cities in the empire. Ignorant as he was he understood the magnitude of the achievement, and dismayed as he was as to his present position, still at this moment he enjoyed keenly a certain amount of elation. Of course he had committed forgery,--of course he had committed robbery. That, indeed, was nothing, for he had been cheating and forging and stealing all his life. Of course he was in danger of almost immediate detection and punishment. He hardly hoped that the evil day would be very much longer protracted, and yet he enjoyed his triumph. Whatever they might do, quick as they might be, they could hardly prevent his taking his seat in the House of Commons. Then if they sent him to penal servitude for life, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they had so treated the member for Westminster! ...|$|E
60|$|No such scene {{had ever}} been beheld in the House of Commons. Members came down at break of day to secure their places; before noon every seat was marked, and (M114) crowded benches were even arrayed {{on the floor of}} the House from the mace to the bar. Princes, ambassadors, great peers, high prelates, thronged the lobbies. The fame of the orator, the boldness of his exploit, curiosity as to the plan, poignant anxiety as to the party result, wonder whether a wizard had at last {{actually}} arisen with a spell for casting out the baleful spirits that had for so many ages made Ireland our torment and our dishonour, all these things brought together such an assemblage as no minister before had ever addressed within those world-renowned walls. The parliament was new. Many of its members had fought a hard battle for their seats, and trusted they were safe in the haven for half a dozen good years to come. Those who were moved by professional ambition, those whose object was social advancement, those who thought only of upright public service, the keen party men, the men who aspired to office, the men with a past and the men who looked for a future, all alike found themselves adrift on dark and troubled waters. The secrets of the bill had been well kept. To-day the disquieted host were first to learn what was the great project to which they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Aye or No on which for them and for the state so much would hang.|$|E
