In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been signs that the disease is abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.|$|E
25|$|Dysentery and {{diarrhea}} result directly from famine, typically through consumption of poor-quality food or {{deterioration of the}} digestive system caused by malnutrition. Cholera is a <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> associated with poor sanitation and contaminated water or food; it is often considered a disease brought on more by social disruption than malnutrition. Cholera arose from different sources near {{the onset of the}} faminecarried by escapees from Burma and erupting {{in the wake of the}} October cyclone and flooding. Smallpox was an airborne disease often associated with crowded living arrangements. Statistics for smallpox and cholera are probably more reliable than those for malaria, since their symptoms are more easily recognisable.|$|E
25|$|Before the outbreak, Haiti {{suffered}} from relatively poor {{public health and}} sanitation infrastructure. As of 2008, 37% of Haiti's population lacked access to adequate drinking water, and 83% lacked improved sanitation facilities. This made Haiti particularly vulnerable to an outbreak of <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease.</b> In January, 2010, a massive earthquake hit Haiti, killing over 100,000 people and further disrupting healthcare and sanitation infrastructure in the country. In {{the aftermath of the}} earthquake, international workers from many countries arrived in Haiti to assist in the rebuilding effort, including a number of workers from countries where cholera was endemic. This presented an opportunity for cholera to spread to Haiti.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nepal is a {{developing}} country. Lack of sustainability of {{water supply and}} sanitation services are always considered as major issue in developing countries that accounts for high prevalence of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> such as diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and jaundice. In addition, socioeconomic status such as; education, income and occupation are also the bottle-necks in developing countries, like Nepal, which might be the other potential influential factors associated with prevalence of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Objective: This study aims to assess the association of water, sanitation and socioeconomic status with the prevalence rate of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Method: The associations were established by collecting data via a self-prepared questionnaire in Daman and Palung Village Development Committees (VDC), Makwanpur district, Nepal. Data were analyzed by performing the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test of independence, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result: The prevalence of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> was found to be 50. 7 % in our study. This study showed a significant association between level of education and risk of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, associations could not be established between water, sanitation and <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusion: Education was found to be an influential factor for the occurrence of the diarrheal diseases in the study sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the problem of attaining safe and clean water that has contributed to high incidence of water borne diseases and to investigate its effects on the residents of Chawama Township, Lusaka, Zambia. A survey was used to collect data from 400 male and female participants to determine their source, treatment and storage of water; sanitary facilities; attitude, experience and knowledge of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Findings indicated that, the most common source of water was communal city taps and residents did not boil or add chlorine to make it safe for use, making it susceptible for them to contract <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Pit latrines were the common type of toilet facility residents used. Almost all of the participants had a wide knowledge of <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> particularly cholera and diarrhea. An understanding of the link between unsafe water and <b>waterborne</b> <b>diseases</b> can be useful to the decision makers for planning, management and evaluation of water supply policies.

It is the largest outbreak of <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> ever to occur in New Zealand. All schools in Havelock North closed for two weeks, with the Hastings District Council advising an urgent notice to boil water for at least one minute before consumption.

The primary reporting tool for WBDOSS prior to 2009 was the CDC 52.12 <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak reporting form.

Secondary data sources include case reports of water-associated cases of PAM caused by Naegleria fowleri infections, case reports for chemical/toxin poisoning and wound infections (reported sporadically), data about recreational water-associated Vibrio cases from the Cholera and Other Vibrio Surveillance System, and case reports for pool chemical-related health events not associated with recreational water (reported sporadically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> {{outbreaks}} may {{be associated}} with recreational water, water intended for drinking, water not intended for drinking (non-recreational water, for example, from cooling towers or ornamental fountains) and water of unknown intent. In order for a <b>waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak to be included in WBDOSS there must be an epidemiologic link between two or more persons that includes a location of water exposure, a clearly defined time period for the water exposure, and one or more waterborne illnesses caused by pathogens such as bacteria, parasites and viruses, or by chemicals/toxins. Common routes of exposure to waterborne pathogens include swallowing contaminated water, inhaling water droplets or airborne chemicals from the water, and direct physical contact with contaminated water. Epidemiologic evidence must implicate water or volatile compounds from the water that have entered the air as the probable source of the illness. WBDOSS outbreaks are further evaluated and classified based on the strength of evidence in the outbreak report that implicates water as the source of the outbreak. <b>Waterborne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks that have both strong epidemiologic data and comprehensive water-quality testing data are assigned a higher class than outbreaks with weak epidemiologic data and little or no water-quality testing data.|$|E
