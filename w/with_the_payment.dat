5|$|Changes {{also took}} place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls {{rather than on}} {{literary}} pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed {{the backbone of the}} military forces. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.|$|E

They show Ireland in the early medieval period {{to have been a}} hierarchical society, taking great care to define social status, and the rights and duties that went with it, according to property, and the relationships between lords and their clients and serfs.|$|E

Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.|$|E
25|$|The Aztec empire was an {{informal}} or hegemonic empire {{because it did}} not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were paid.|$|E

25|$|In {{this period}} Lata Mangeshkar has {{recorded}} duets with Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Rafi, and Kishore Kumar. For {{a brief period}} during the 1960s, she was not on good terms with Mohammed Rafi {{over the issue of}} royalty payments to singers. Mangeshkar wanted Rafi to back her in demanding a half-share from the five percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. But Rafi took a diametrically opposite view, and believed that a playback singer's claim on the filmmaker ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of the agreed fee for the song. This led to tensions between the two. After an argument during the recording of the song Tasveer Teri Dil Mein (Maya, 1961), the two refused to sing with each other. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Apple Records {{filed suit}} against Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) for {{trademark}} infringement.

A dispute subsequently arose in 1989 when Apple Corps sued, alleging that Apple Computer's machines' ability to play back MIDI music was a violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement, of around $26.5 million, was reached. In September 2003, Apple Computer was again sued by Apple Corps, this time for introducing the iTunes Music Store and the iPod, which Apple Corps asserted was a violation of Apple's agreement not to distribute music. The trial opened on 29 March 2006 in the UK, and in a judgement issued on 8 May 2006, Apple Corps lost the case.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{members of}} the Independent Constitutional Commission were also {{appointed}} to engage Somali constitutional lawyers, religious scholars and experts in Somali culture over the nation's upcoming new constitution, {{a key part of}} the government's Transitional Federal Tasks. In addition, high level federal delegations were dispatched to defuse clan-related tensions in several regions. According to the prime minister of Somalia, to improve transparency, Cabinet ministers fully disclosed their assets and signed a code of ethics. An Anti-Corruption Commission with the power to carry out formal investigations and to review government decisions and protocols was also established to more closely monitor all activities by public officials. Furthermore, unnecessary trips abroad by members of government were prohibited, and all travel by ministers required the Premier's consent. A budget outlining 2011's federal expenditures was also put before and approved by members of parliament, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of civil service employees prioritized. In addition, a full audit of government property and vehicles is being put into place. On the war front, the new government and its AMISOM allies also managed to secure control of Mogadishu by August 2011. According to the African Union and Prime Minister Mohamed, with increasing troop strength the pace of territorial gains was also expected to greatly accelerate.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, Branham's {{career began}} to falter. Even as he became famous, Branham {{continued}} to wear cheap suits and refuse large salaries; {{he was not}} interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry. His financial difficulties came to a head in 1956 when the Internal Revenue Service charged Branham with tax evasion. The investigation showed that Branham did not pay close attention to the amount of money flowing through his ministry, and that others were taking advantage of him. The case was eventually settled out of court <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of a $40,000 penalty. His correspondance also sharply decreased. Where he once had received [...] "a thousand letters a day, his mail dropped down to 75" [...] but Branham thought the decline was only temporary.|$|E

2500|$|Coffin {{returned}} to Britain, whereupon the sentence {{came to the}} attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, who insisted that the full punishment required by the 31st Article of War be carried out. Coffin was duly dismissed from the navy, though he lodged an appeal against the decision. In the meantime Coffin emigrated to Flanders and travelled as a mercenary throughout Denmark, Sweden and Russia, in search of a commission. Meanwhile Coffin's case was considered by the judges of the admiralty, on the question of whether the Admiralty had the right to set aside the judgement of a court-martial. After considering the case, they recorded that though the judgement reached in the original court-martial had not been legal, '... the punishment directed to be inflicted ... upon persons convicted of the offence specified in the 31st Article of War ... cannot be inflicted, or judgement thereupon be pronounced, or supplied by any other authority than that of the Court Martial which tried the offender.' In other words, Howe's decision to overrule the sentence imposed by the original court-martial was ruled invalid, and Coffin was reinstated in the service, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> of arrears in his wages. The judgement defined the limits of Admiralty interference with courts-martial, and became a frequently cited precedent.|$|E
