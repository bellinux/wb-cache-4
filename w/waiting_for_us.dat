500|$|Responding to the criticism, {{one of the}} film's producers, Elie Samaha, complained: [...] " [...] {{critics were}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to… chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology for some reason. I didn't know people were so prejudiced." [...] Ebert noted, however, that the film [...] "contains no {{evidence}} of Scientology, or any other system of thought." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. [...] Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media's financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication {{came as a shock}} to the entire staff. [...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> when we got to work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, {{you run the risk of}} people forgetting about you; that's the sad thing about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor." [...] In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, [...] "Go Big and Go Home" [...] included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series.|$|E

500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics for [...] "T.W.L" [...] {{are about}} going forward towards a goal without looking back. The chorus {{emphasizes}} this with, [...] " [...] Ok! Don't say 4... 5.../Just prepare yourself/Rush through that door/What's <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> there (We'll just go anyway)". The song also uses {{a lot of}} bilingual word puns and regular Japanese puns to bring double meaning to the song. [...] "Hiraku to be love" [...] when sung sounds like [...] "Hiraku tobira" [...] (Open the door) and [...] "I? Ai? Ai ai..." [...] (I? Love? All together...).|$|E

2500|$|The band {{undertook}} the Iron Maiden Tour {{in support}} of the album, during which they played their first ever concerts in mainland Europe, where they were surprised to discover how successful Iron Maiden had been outside the UK, with Steve Harris commenting, [...] "The prestige of doing so well in the UK had turned into a sort of word-of-mouth thing, and we'd turn up in places like Leiden, in Holland, places we'd never even heard of, and they'd have these massive banners <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> with [...] "Iron Maiden Go Over The Top" [...] written on them and all this. It was unreal." ...|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
