500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was nine years old, and I was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E

60|$|THE ORDERLY (deeply wounded). The {{service is}} a disgrace to me. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> people pass me in the street with this uniform on, I ardly know which way to look. There never was a soldier in my family before.|$|R
6000|$|... and <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> clear {{voice rose}} on the notes of that exultant chorus, our hearts {{responded with a}} surge of emotion akin to that which sent the {{followers}} of Daniel Boone across the Blue Ridge, and lined the trails of Kentucky and Ohio with the canvas-covered wagons of the pioneers.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{seeing that}} I was not wanted, I took my cudgel {{and started down}} the {{bridle-path}} towards the common footbridge, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> called me back.|$|R
60|$|Peggotty only laughed the more, {{and held}} her apron tight over her face <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> tried to pull it away, and sat as if her head were in a bag.|$|E

6000|$|... "You and I {{were both}} very young <b>when</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> died; but I think you must {{remember}} that she, {{like the rest of}} her family, was a Roman Catholic.|$|R
60|$|If {{anything}} was lacking--any least quality of adaptation, it was supplied <b>when,</b> that evening, <b>my</b> uncles {{and my father}} discovered that Zulime could not only read music, but that she could play all the old songs which they loved to have me sing. This accomplishment completed their conquest, for under her deft hands the piano revived the wistful melodies of Minnie Minturn, Maggie, and Nellie Wildwood, and <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> voice, sweet as ever, but weak and hesitant, joined with mine in singing for our guests, I was both glad and sad, glad of my young wife, sad with a realization of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> weakness and age.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was at Winona last Saturday, and {{expected}} to stay there till June, when I was due to graduate. Then the devil broke loose, and here I am. <b>When</b> will <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> case come up?" ...|$|R
60|$|On {{that third}} morning I opened {{my heart to}} them. At last the words passed my lips which I had longed to speak on the day <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> told me of her death.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died I {{was very}} young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could {{scarcely}} cry ‘Weep! weep! weep! weep!’ So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.|$|E
60|$|I {{was running}} {{to the door to}} welcome him, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> called me back. I turned and looked at her. She smiled. So did I. Without uttering a word we both sat down to finish our breakfast.|$|E

60|$|Thereafter <b>when</b> alone, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and I often {{talked of}} {{the good old days}} in Wisconsin, of David and Deborah and William and Frank. I told her of Aunt Loretta's {{peaceful}} life, of the green hills and trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "The letter {{came from}} Paris, but no address was given. It was <b>when</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> died. He {{wrote to me}} then, with some {{instructions}} and some advice, and I have never heard from him since." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{got to be}} eighty-five {{years old}} her memory failed her. She forgot little threads that hold life's patches of meaning together. She was living out West then, and I went on to visit her.|$|E

60|$|My memory lingers {{upon this}} scene by {{contrast}} with the sad, changed days that swiftly followed, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> eyes would flash towards my father angry gleams, and her voice ring cruel and hard; though the moment he was gone her lips would tremble and her eyes grow soft again and fill with tears; <b>when</b> <b>my</b> father would sit with averted face and sullen lips tight pressed, or worse, would open them only to pour forth a rapid flood of savage speech; and fling out of the room, slamming the door behind him, and I would find him hours afterwards, sitting alone in the dark, with bowed head between his hands.|$|R
6000|$|Ah, {{you will}} understand; <b>When</b> I carried <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> downstairs, A few times only, at the {{beginning}} Of her soft-foot malady, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> died. Why does she want to see you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Only once, can I {{recall a}} cloud. That was one Sunday <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> {{speaking}} {{across the table}} in the middle of dinner, said to my father, [...] "We might save the rest of that stew, Luke; there's an omelette coming." ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{there had}} been war between our people and the Zulu people, and Senzangacona had killed some of our warriors and taken many of our cattle. So, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> heard the speech of Unandi she sprang up in anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{so pretty}} {{as the one}} I used to see <b>when</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>mother</b> sat here, and I, a little child, at her knee. Ah, my dears, she could have told you stories all night long, and well worth hearing. I was never tired of them." ...|$|R
