500|$|The {{idea of a}} solo singer {{alternating}} with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus [...] (Peace be <b>with</b> <b>you).</b> <b>A</b> string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as [...] "a dramatic scena in which the strings work up a storm to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, [...] "Peace be with you", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a [...] "gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer {{to the music of}} the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (""). The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (""), and finally overcoming death (""). The following fourth appearance of [...] "Peace be with you" [...] is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an [...] "operatic scene" [...] and continues [...] "Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities." [...] Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> plan to attack him." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E
