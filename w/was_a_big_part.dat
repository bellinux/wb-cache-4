According to biographer Alan Paul, [...] "these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts." [...] Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, [...] "You know, we get kind of frustrated doing the [...] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be... a live recording, {{to get some of}} that natural fire on it."

At Fillmore East was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a double album, [...] "people-priced" [...] for the cost of a single LP. While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often {{near the bottom of the}} top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days. At Fillmore East peaked at number 13 on Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.

She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> of my wanting to do a record.

500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} episode 6.8/10, {{explaining}} {{that after the}} premiere's [...] "exciting, new direction" [...] of an episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] helped Lost [...] "take a step back [...] delivers nothing new or substantial". He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and [...] "a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as [...] "the only compelling scene in the whole episode". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining [...] "A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on-island plot." [...] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing [...] "it felt appropriate for Losts third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting.

500|$|Crackdown was envisioned {{to exceed}} the {{gameplay}} of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player [...] "toys" [...] {{to create their own}} in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. [...] The crackdown logo is {{in the shape of the}} agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. [...] Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>part</b> of the idea to just let people do things", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; [...] "testers would do things we were completely blown away by". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as [...] "How do we reward somebody for just having fun?" [...] They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. [...] Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. [...] Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. [...] They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. [...] An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player may not realize the potential of the game and would not complete it; [...] "People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games". [...] Jones also expressed concern that [...] "This game does not look good in screenshots". [...] They took two major steps to overcome this. [...] First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. [...] Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do.|$|E
