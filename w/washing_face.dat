2500|$|Others {{have noted}} the {{similarities}} between the maneki-nekos gesture and that of a cat <b>washing</b> its <b>face.</b> There is a Japanese belief that a cat <b>washing</b> its <b>face</b> means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older Chinese proverb that states that if a cat <b>washes</b> its <b>face,</b> it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat <b>washing</b> its <b>face</b> would bring in customers. In his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, China's Tang Dynasty author Duan Chengshi (803?-863) wrote: [...] "If a cat raises its paw over the ears and <b>washes</b> its <b>face,</b> then patrons will come".|$|R

For example in the case of wudu (ritual washings) the prevalent sequence of <b>washing</b> (<b>face,</b> hands, head and feet) is defended [...] "being the most natural", as the author puts it. The eyes behold and inform the heart, which in its turn alarms the brain, where the deliberation takes place. The face has a kind of natural preference over other parts of the body. The feelings are expressed by the face and then comes the turn of the hands to carry out the orders of the brain. The washing of the feet in the end is not to belittle their importance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} wearable accelerometers and wireless home sensors {{for the detection of}} early morning daily activities. In particular we focus on the detection of brushing, <b>washing</b> <b>face</b> and shaving activities by using a wireless accelerometer sensor attached to the right wrist of subjects to collect the hand movement data. First the system localizes the subject in the bathroom with a wireless home motion sensor. This is followed by extraction of time and frequency domain features of accelerometer data. These features are input to an ensemble of Gaussian mixture models which represent each activity we focus on and then post processed by a finite state machine for classification. We show promising experimental results from 7 subjects while completing <b>washing</b> <b>face,</b> shaving and brushing activities. The proposed system achieved 93. 5 %, 92. 5 % and 95. 6 % classification accuracy in the recognition of these three tasks respectively. T I...|$|E
30|$|Here was a 55 -year-old female {{patient with}} episodic {{stabbing}} pain {{on the right}} superior eyelid for 2  years. The VAS score was eight. The onset time was about 1  minute and the remission period was completely pain free. The pain could be triggered by daily activities like smiling, <b>washing</b> <b>face,</b> speaking and eating. Any contact with the upper eyelid could lead to pain outbreak. Apart from the allodynia on the skin of upper eyelid, no abnormality was found in neurological examinations. Also, the ophthalmologic exams including funduscopy, intraocular pressure, visual field testing was normal. The head CT and MRI scan were also normal. The patient had no history of surgical operation and trauma, no history of diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic heart diseases, hepatitis, and some other relevant chronic diseases. The patient was diagnosed as primary TN.|$|E

40|$|Face {{cleanliness}} is a {{core component}} of the SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements) strategy for trachoma control. Understanding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> may be helpful for designing effective interventions for improving facial cleanliness. In April 2014, a mixed methods study including focus groups and a quantitative cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the East Gojjam zone of the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Participants were asked about <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> practices, motivations for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> use of soap (which may reduce bacterial load), and fly control strategies. Overall, both knowledge and reported practice of <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> was high. Participants reported they knew that <b>washing</b> their own <b>face</b> and their children's faces daily was important for hygiene and infection control. Although participants reported high knowledge of the importance of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> quantitative data revealed strong variations by community in the use of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> ranging from 4. 4 % to 82. 2 % of households reporting using soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing.</b> Cost and forgetfulness were cited as barriers to the use of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing.</b> Keeping flies from landing on children was a commonly cited motivator for regular <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> as was trachoma prevention. Interventions aiming to improve facial cleanliness for trachoma prevention should focus on habit formation (to address forgetfulness) and address barriers to the use of soap, such as reducing cost. Interventions that focus solely on improving knowledge may not be effective for changing face-washing behaviors...|$|R

30|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} (TN) is {{a common}} disease mainly occurs in the elderly. It is a severe facial pain typically featured by paroxysmal onset, short persistence, sharp, stabbing or electric shock like in the regions innervated by certain branches of the trigeminal nerve (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache S 2013). Attacks can be triggered by <b>washing</b> <b>face,</b> speaking, brushing, eating and any contact with certain part of face. Clinically, frontal areas, infraorbital or paranasal areas, mandibular areas and teeth are the mostly affected areas in TN. Here we report a rare case of drug-resistant TN affecting only the upper eyelid. Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal neurolysis is an effective, safe, and minimal-invasive treatment for those refractory to drug therapy. However, the sensory innervation of the upper eyelid is complex. After review of the anatomic data and the diagnostic nerve block, we applied neurolysis to infratrochlear, supratrochlear and lacrimal nerves respectively in this case.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw <b>washing,</b> <b>face</b> washing, and body washing. The first experiment found that rates of paw washing and body washing increased reliably under a food contingency, but face washing did not. A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration of paw washing and body washing decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on face washing, however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate of paw washing but no increase in face washing. It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw washing and body washing may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing. On the other hand, increases in paw washing under the face washing contingency suggested that increases in the rate of grooming movements may occur by means other than operant relations...|$|E

40|$|To {{estimate}} the prevalence and identify risk {{factors that may}} be associated with acne among university students in Syria, a cross-sectional study was conducted in the Syrian International University for Science and Technology in December 2009. A sample of 500 students was chosen. Each participant was subjected to an interview and clinical examination of acne in addition to height and weight measurements. Acne prevalence was 34. 7 % (172 / 496). Male students had higher rate of acne compared to females (42. 9 % versus 23. 6 %, P< 0. 0001) and their acne started significantly at a younger age (18. 13 versus 19. 04 years old, P< 0. 0001). Face was the commonest site for acne in both males and females. <b>Washing</b> <b>face</b> frequently per day in both sexes has a significant relation with a decreased prevalence of acne. Moreover, psychological stress particularly when the students were away from family was associated with a significant higher rate of acne. We found that the prevalence of acne steadily increased with increasing body mass index. Acne is a health and psychological problem among university students particularly when affecting the face. Several factors such as gender, body mass index, and stress were found to be associated with acne formation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} typically involves nerves supplying teeth, {{jaws and}} face of older females. Though the etiology is usually obscure, different treatment modalities {{have been tried}} for it viz. medicinal treatment, injection alcohol, peripheral neurectomy, rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression etc. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is an emerging and promising option for management of such patients. Aims and Design: The present study was designed with an aim to study the efficacy of TENS in management of trigeminal neuralgia. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 30 patients of trigeminal neuralgia confirmed by diagnostic nerve block. They were given bursts of TENS for 20 - 40 days over {{the path of the}} affected nerve and subsequently evaluated at 1 month and 3 month intervals by visual analogue scale (VAS), verbal pain scale (VPS), a functional outcome scales for main daily activities like sleep, chewing, talking, or <b>washing</b> <b>face.</b> Results: The results showed that, on VAS, the score decreased from 8. 9 (Pre TENS) to 3. 1 at 1 month and 1. 3 at 3 months, and on VPS, the score decreased from 3. 5 (Pre TENS) to 1. 2 at 1 month and 0. 3 at 3 months. Similarly, a considerable decrease in scores was seen on functional outcome scale for different activities. No side effects like irritation or redness of skin were seen in any of the patients. Conclusions: Thus, TENS was found to be a safe, easily acceptable, and non-invasive outdoor patient department procedure for management of trigeminal neuralgia...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{infectious}} disease epidemics and pandemics are recurring events that levy a high cost on individuals and society. The health-protective behavioral {{response of the}} public {{plays an important role}} in limiting respiratory {{infectious disease}} spread. Health-protective behaviors take several forms. Behaviors can be categorized as pharmaceutical (e. g., vaccination uptake, antiviral use) or non-pharmaceutical (e. g., hand <b>washing,</b> <b>face</b> mask use, avoidance of public transport). Due to the limitations of pharmaceutical interventions during respiratory epidemics and pandemics, public health campaigns aimed at limiting disease spread often emphasize both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical behavioral interventions. Understanding the determinants of the public's behavioral response is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread. While other reviews have qualitatively analyzed the body of work on demographic determinants of health-protective behavior, this meta-analysis quantitatively combines the results from 85 publications to determine the global relationship between gender and health-protective behavioral response. The results show that women in the general population are about 50 % more likely than men to adopt/practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors. Conversely, men in the general population are marginally (about 12 %) more likely than women to adopt/practice pharmaceutical behaviors. It is possible that factors other than pharmaceutical/non-pharmaceutical status not included in this analysis act as moderators of this relationship. These results suggest an inherent difference in how men and women respond to epidemic and pandemic respiratory infectious diseases. This information can be used to target specific groups when developing non-pharmaceutical public health campaigns and to parameterize epidemic models incorporating demographic information...|$|E

The study sought to find out the perceptions of the people on common blinding eye diseases especially trachoma and cataract. The mean age was 46 years. There was a slightly higher proportion (53. 3 %) of females. The respondents had different levels of educational attainments. Less than half the respondents mentioned trachoma and cataract as eye problems in their community. Even fewer considered these to be blinding. The people had a much clearer understanding of trachoma than cataract. They believed these conditions have natural and supernatural causes. The majority believed blindness due to trachoma and cataract can be prevented. Main methods included early treatment of the conditions (by medicines from hospital or traditional healer) and <b>washing</b> <b>face</b> daily. The majority believed blinding trachoma and cataract can be treated, mainly b" Western medicines, Few believed surgery can cure cataract blindness.

40|$|Abstract Background During an {{influenza}} pandemic, {{higher education}} institutions with large populations of young adults can become serious outbreak centers. Since outbreak management is essential to disease control, we aimed to examine university students' knowledge of and attitudes toward the pandemic influenza A/H 1 N 1 and vaccination and other preventive measures. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 first year university students at Yeditepe University in Istanbul, Turkey between 1 st and 30 th of November 2009. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics of the students, perceptions, level of knowledge and attitudes toward influenza pandemic and prevention measures were collected {{by means of a}} self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed by the students affiliated with SANITAS, a university club of students in health related sciences. Results 25. 1 % (101 / 402) of the study group perceived their personal risk of influenza as "high", while 40. 5 % (163 / 402) perceived it as "moderate", 20. 6 % (107 / 402) viewed it as "low" and 7. 7 % (31 / 402) indicated that it was "unknown". The risk perception of males was significantly lower than that of females (p = 0. 004) and the risk perception among the students of health sciences was significantly lower than that of students of other sciences (p = 0. 037). Within the study group, 72. 1 % (290 / 402) indicated that their main information source regarding H 1 N 1 was the mass media. Health sciences students tended to rely more on the internet as an information source than other students (p = 0. 015). The vast majority (92. 8 %; 373 / 402) of those interviewed indicated {{that they would not be}} vaccinated. The major concerns regarding vaccination had to do with the safety and side effects of the vaccine. Most of the participants (343 / 402, 85. 3 %) were carrying out one of prevention measures and the vast majority believed that hand <b>washing,</b> <b>face</b> mask and quarantina were effective measures for prevention. Conclusion The participants had enough knowledge about H 1 N 1 pandemic about the disease although there were still gaps and confusions in some areas. In the future, when planning management strategies regarding pandemics or outbreaks in {{higher education institutions}}, new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines. Main information source is mass media, so it seems that new policies must be developed to attract attention of students to use different and more scientific-based information sources. </p...|$|E
