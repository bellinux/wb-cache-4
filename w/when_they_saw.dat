5|$|On October 7, the British saw the new allied trench {{just out}} of musket-range. Over {{the next two days}} the allies {{completed}} the gun placements and dragged the artillery into line. The British fire began to weaken <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the large number of guns the allies had.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> and heard what had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|Most of her tenants bitterly resented {{her for the}} {{decision}} to remain on Sark during the ensuing five years of occupation, but thanked her after the war <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> how total evacuation destroyed the neighbouring island of Alderney. The Dame had her senior official meet German officers at the harbour and escort them to her residence, where her maid announced {{them as if they}} were guests.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} still {{discussing}} this matter <b>when</b> <b>they</b> suddenly <b>saw</b> Joe Jackson dash {{up to the}} ranch house on his horse and dismount in great haste.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days after}} the shipwreck, Walter and John Whitefoot met at the place which they had agreed on, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> last <b>saw</b> each other four days before.|$|R
25|$|The rose of Jacob was {{cheerful and}} glad, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> jointly <b>saw</b> Mordechai robed in royal blue. You have been their eternal salvation, and their hope {{throughout}} generations.|$|R
5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|Director Mike Nichols, who {{had seen}} Cher onstage in Jimmy Dean, offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film Silkwood. When it premiered in 1983, audiences {{questioned}} Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> her name in the credits. For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|Madden {{said that}} {{challenges}} of filming in India included the street noise, {{as well as}} the people's curiosity and hospitality <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him producing a camera. The cast and crew were well received by the locals, as was the director who, along with the cast, was invited by Arvind Singh Mewar, the Maharaja of Udaipur, to attend his lavish Diwali celebrations and firework display, as well as attend a royal wedding held at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur. Chris Gill was the editor of the picture.|$|E
50|$|Opal helped Erica {{devise a}} plan to win Jackson back and they {{attended}} Adam's party. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> arrived, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Jackson speaking with Krystal and Erica pulled him away for a private discussion. Opal continued to mingle with the other guests, {{many of which were}} her family and friends and she celebrated life in Pine Valley as a shot rang out.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo, {{the father}} of Diego and Lucas, {{together}} with Rosa, their nanny, was shocked <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> Daniel. Cristina brought the clone to the Ferrer's and both Leonardo and Rosa thought Daniel is Diego, reincarnates.|$|R
5000|$|Davis {{has three}} children: Jack, Catherine and Jensen, as {{mentioned}} in the Garfield: The Movie DVD commentary. Davis's three children said that the CG version of Garfield looked [...] "evil" [...] <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> him.|$|R
5|$|Stone and Judy {{convinced}} {{the managers of}} two bars in Seattle, Washington, to set up Donkey Kong machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a week straight, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{was opposed}} to the {{traditional}} practice of rewarding wealthy supporters with key ambassadorial posts, preferring that diplomats not live in a lavish lifestyle and selecting men who, as Taft put it, would recognize an American <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> one. High on his list for dismissal was the ambassador to France, Henry White, whom Taft knew and disliked from his visits to Europe. White's ousting caused other career State Department employees to fear that their jobs might be lost to politics. Taft also wanted to replace the Roosevelt-appointed ambassador in London, Whitelaw Reid, but Reid, owner of the New-York Tribune, had backed Taft during the campaign, and both William and Nellie Taft enjoyed his gossipy reports. Reid remained in place until his 1912 death.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came {{on a collision course}} with the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E
60|$|He paused {{again and}} wearily passed {{his hand over}} his eyes--a {{familiar}} gesture, as Myrtle knew. His voice had grown more and more dismal as he proceeded, and just now he seemed as desolate and unhappy as <b>when</b> first <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him at the Grand Canyon.|$|R
50|$|The team's {{achievements}} in 2008-09, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> remained unbeaten, <b>saw</b> them rewarded by being named 'BBC West Team of the Year'.|$|R
60|$|He didn't try it, and I'm glad he didn't, for I {{should have}} been sorry enough {{to have had the}} boys go back and say that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> last <b>saw</b> Rectus and I we were having a big fight {{on the deck of the}} steamer.|$|R
5|$|No. 81 Wing is {{responsible}} for operating the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the wing comprises three combat units, Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons based at Williamtown and No.75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, {{as well as an}} operational conversion unit at Williamtown. No.81 Wing headquarters oversees squadron training in air-to-air and air-to-ground tactics, and support for the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. Tasked with offensive and defensive counter-air operations, the Hornets have been deployed to Diego Garcia in 2001–02, when they provided local air defence, to Iraq in 2003, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> action flying fighter escort and close air support missions in concert with Coalition forces, and to the Middle East in 2015–16, when they undertook strike operations during the military intervention against ISIL. They have also been employed to patrol high-profile events in Australia, including the Commonwealth Games and visits by foreign dignitaries.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{that the}} Moors {{had taken the}} bridge, they panicked and fled. The Moors {{followed}} up.|$|E

60|$|Superior beings, <b>when</b> of late <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> A mortal man unfold all Nature's law, Admired such {{wisdom in}} an earthly shape, And show'd a Newton as {{we show an}} ape.|$|R
25|$|There {{is a story}} that, {{when the}} Odessa people learned that the {{construction}} cost 1.3 million gold rubles, they gasped, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the new theatre, they gasped again, this time in admiration.|$|E
25|$|Her {{determination}} {{was such}} that junior ministers and civil servants of the Foreign Office would reputedly duck behind pillars <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> her coming. She supported the points of Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee but earned the enmity of Neville Chamberlain.|$|E
25|$|Messalina {{considered}} Agrippina's son {{a threat}} to her son's position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins fled in terror <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a snake suddenly dart from beneath Lucius' pillow—but {{it was only a}} sloughed-off snake-skin in his bed, near his pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{waited in}} the sitting-room while {{he went down to}} the door; so I knew nothing of what passed between them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> each other again. But oh, the {{difference}} between the two men when the interval had passed, and they came upstairs together and joined me.|$|R
60|$|Seven-eighths of {{the city}} was now destroyed; and with the {{exception}} of the king's palace and a few temples, all the buildings that had, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> it, so excited the admiration of the Spaniards, and had made the city one of the loveliest in the world, had been leveled.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} reached Court Leys {{and walked up}} the avenue that led to the house. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> Dick hurrying towards them. They waved their hands, but he did not reply, and, <b>when</b> he approached, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that his face was white and anxious.|$|R
25|$|The {{batteries}} surrounding Puerto Cabello {{opened fire}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the ship sailing away, and scored {{a number of}} hits on the ship, but no major damage was done. Hamilton ordered no shots to be fired, and no light to be shown; a tactic which worked, as Santa Cecilia sailed out of danger.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> these Union reinforcements, the Confederates {{retreated to}} their main entrenchments along White Oak Road, abandoning {{control of the}} Boydton Plank Road and leaving behind badly wounded men and some others who surrendered. Chamberlain then {{positioned}} his men along with the artillery battery on either side {{and in front of}} the Lewis farm buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Jin Shu {{mentioned}} that Chen Shou fell sick during the filial mourning period after his father's death. Some guests who visited his home expressed disapproval <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him being served medicine by his servants, {{because he was}} expected to lead an austere life during that period. His fellow townsfolk criticised him when they heard about it.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{working in}} the fields were wary <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> the {{approaching}} Union ships and troops, but word spread quickly that the forces were there to liberate them. Many slaves ran to the riverbank and begged to be taken on board the ships, despite the efforts of overseers and Confederate soldiers to stop them.|$|R
50|$|Lumber mill workers Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard {{are friends}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are <b>sawing</b> trees, but when Wally Walrus (making a brief cameo as the lumber camp chef) rings the dinner bell, they become bitter enemies. Woody and Buzz duke it out over food, with the woods being pecked {{to death in}} the process.|$|R
