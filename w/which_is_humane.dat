According to New Historicist theory it is {{informed}} by many disciplines, namely, philosophy, history, literary theory, theology, social science, and psychology, and it attempts to lessen injustices of race and class. The essay examines how satire operates in the novel, focusing on its societal targets: totalitarianism, laboratory animals, and education. Lewis’ philosophical idea expressed in his “The Abolition of Man” – that a society that averts from what he calls universal, timeless, objective values will eventually lead {{to a loss of}} that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> truly <b>humane</b> – <b>is</b> a main theme of the novel as well as for this essay.

60|$|A {{policy has}} been adopted toward the Indian tribes inhabiting {{a large portion of}} the {{territory}} of the United States <b>which</b> has <b>been</b> <b>humane</b> and has substantially ended Indian hostilities in the whole land except in a portion of Nebraska, and Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana Territories--the Black Hills region and approaches thereto. Hostilities there have grown out of the avarice of the white man, who has violated our treaty stipulations in his search for gold. The question might be asked why the Government has not enforced obedience to the terms of the treaty prohibiting the occupation of the Black Hills region by whites. The answer is simple: The first immigrants to the Black Hills were removed by troops, but rumors of rich discoveries of gold took into that region increased numbers. Gold has actually been found in paying quantity, and an effort to remove the miners would only result in the desertion of the bulk of the troops that might be sent there to remove them. All difficulty in this matter has, however, been removed--subject to the approval of Congress--by a treaty ceding the Black Hills and approaches to settlement by citizens.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas Rohkrämer {{criticized the}} concept of reactionary modernism, arguing [...] "It is simply not strange or 'paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace {{technology}} at the same time', but a common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany {{as well as in}} many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available for an endless number of different purposes, many of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not <b>humane</b> or enlightened". Support for this view also came from Roger Griffin, who argued [...] "Fascism as an ideology and movement can be seen as proposing a radical alternative to liberal and socialist visions of what form modernity ideally should take. It represents an uncompromising rejection both of thorough-going liberalism and extreme 'modernism', whose logical culmination it sees as relativism, anomie, subjectivism, and the loss of definitive meaning and 'eternal' values. It is an attempt to re-anchor modern human beings within that highly modern phenomenon, the totalitarian state (a term used positively by Fascism) through consciously manipulated historical, national and racist myth (all deeply modern ideological constructs)".|$|R

A counterpart to this decent practice, and a remnant of old English hospitality, was, that the landlord of a principal inn laid aside his character of a publican on the seventh day, and invited the guests who chanced to be within his walls to take a part of his family beef and pudding. This invitation was usually complied with by all whose distinguished rank did not induce them to think compliance a derogation; and the proposal of a bottle of wine after dinner, to drink the landlord's health, was the only recompense ever offered or accepted.|$|R

5000|$|Windschuttle {{challenges}} {{the idea that}} mass killings were commonplace, arguing that the colonial settlers of Australia did not commit widespread massacres against Indigenous Australians; he drastically reduces the figures for the Tasmanian Aboriginal death toll, and writes that Aborigines referred to by both Reynolds and Ryan as resistance figures, included [...] "black bushrangers" [...] and others engaged in acts normally regarded as [...] "criminality"; arguing that the evidence clearly shows that attacks by Aborigines on settlers were almost invariably directed at acquiring goods, such as flour, sugar, tea and tobacco, and that claims by orthodox historians {{that this was a}} form of guerrilla warfare against British settlement aren't supported by credible evidence. Vicki Grieves argues that Windschuttle regards Aboriginal men who traded their women's services as pimps, although Windschuttle does not use the term. Adducing the work of a source who Stuart Macintyre claims is 'a particularly tendentious American anthropologist', he argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal society was primitive, dysfunctional and on the verge of collapse, because their putative maltreatment of women impaired their ability to reproduce in a number of critical ways. Windschuttle agrees with earlier historical analysis, such as that of Geoffrey Blainey, that introduced disease was the primary cause of the demise of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people. He is highly critical of recent historical scholarship, arguing that much of it ignores the scholar's basic duties to be objective and true to the evidence, and he advances a sympathetic analysis of settler opinion, arguing that historians such as Henry Reynolds had misrepresented the contents of records of settler opinion to conceal the fact that the majority of settlers were consistently in favor of the protection of the Aborigines. He also criticises Aboriginal land right politics, arguing that it has resulted in many Aboriginal people being effectively confined to remote settlements far from viable employment opportunities and from the benefits of a modern society. His own examination of archives, contemporary newspapers, diaries and official accounts yields a provisory figure of approximately 120 deaths of Tasmanian Aborigines [...] "for <b>which</b> there <b>is</b> a plausible record of some kind" [...] as having been killed by settlers, as opposed to earlier figures ranging as high as 700, and thus far less than the number of whites (187) reported as killed during the Black War of 1824 to 1828 by Aborigines. Windschuttle argues that the principles of the Enlightenment, fused with the 19th century evangelical revival within the Church of England and Britain's rule of law {{had a profound effect on}} colonial policy and behaviour, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>humane</b> and just, that together made the claimed genocide culturally impossible. Gregory D.B. Smithers argues that Windschuttle interpreted settler violence as self-defence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract "Shath" {{because of}} having {{extended}} relationship with spiritual experiences, unconsciousness, language and literature, religion and religious experiences, society and cultural circumstances often regarded as complex and sometimes meaningless matters confronting of interpretation. This complexity often {{is the result}} of aesthetic and literary language of shathiyat, the influence of unconsciousness mind of Arif (mystic) in the quality of shathiyat or the influence of the necessity of reader’s conditions in explanation of shathiyat. While, to extract meanings from sentences including "Shath" naturally one should know Rhetoric and detect implicit meanings because the surface structure of shath may be in contrast with religious and traditional beliefs and ideals. Another reason is that, according to the reason of collection of Balâghat (Rhetoric) for better discovery of holy meaning of Quran, the holy and high-level meanings never transfer into the addressee by the words <b>which</b> <b>are</b> restricted to the primary meanings but always a set of literary tools such as Code, Symbol, Kenning, Metaphor, Simile and Trope hides a holy and sublime concept under the layers of words to keep far its superiority and reality from the damage of routine and primary meanings. Also, because of constraints and disagreements with mystic education in the many historical periods, mystics had to implicit their education so that their companions understand and outsiders do not. In fact, the interpretation of types of shathiyat weren’t unrelated to the status and spiritual capacity of addressees (the necessity of addressee). It seems to be impossible expectation that we exactly can understand main meaning and real aim of a Shatah (speaker or writer of "Shath"),(of course, there isn’t absolute meaning in realm of literature, but halo of meanings exist that give artistic aspect to literary text) as in hermeneutics doesn’t exist one unchangeable meaning. But Rhetoric encodes ambiguities and complexities of "Shath" by systematic literary ways and detects internal real-related meaning. Undoubtedly, sentences’ implicit meanings exist by circumstances, states, exigencies and rhetoric interprets sentences {{on the basis of this}} way (on the basis of concordance of speech with exigencies of states). Rhetoric has made this capacity in terms of aesthetic relation between the text and addressee to be considered the literary and routine language by the addressee and to enjoy from this difference. Meanwhile, the discovery of secondary meaning (implicit meaning) has another pleasure. The interpretation of shathiyat based on Rhetoric is performed by considering of shathiyat’s relation with three influential branches: the relation of shath with religion, social conditions and mystic’s spiritual conditions. However, always there is a critique about the shath <b>which</b> <b>is</b> based on Rhetoric: variety of spiritual experiences among mystics and unavailability of spiritual areas (because of to be beyond of these areas from the scale of veracity and falsity). Rhetoric wasn’t efficient in the determining of mystics claims. According to what is said, it appears to be appropriate to revise the definition of shath and then to accept that shath often <b>is</b> a saying <b>which</b> <b>is</b> intentional and meaningful from the divinity resource that its paradoxical aspects are its capacity and location <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>humane.</b> Holy sayings <b>are</b> in the frame of mundane words, covering of divine message in the frame of humane expression. The key of encoding codes in this paradoxical, divinity/mundane and divine/humane relation is Rhetoric. This article extends this present theory...|$|R
