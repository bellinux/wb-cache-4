40|$|Aim: We {{assessed}} {{the results of}} laparoscopic transperitoneal ureteroneocystostomy with or <b>without</b> <b>a</b> psoas <b>hitch</b> for management of lower ureteral strictures. Materials and Methods: Between October 2005 and August 2008, 16 patients with lower ureteric strictures underwent laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with or <b>without</b> <b>a</b> psoas <b>hitch.</b> Etiology of strictures was gynecological surgery in 11, surgery for stone disease in 3, ureterovaginal fistula in 1 and primary obstructive megaureter in 1. Transperitoneal 3 - or 4 -port laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy was performed with or without psoas hitch. Results: All operations were successfully completed without any need for conversion to open. Mean operative time was 171. 56 min (range 130 to 260 min), mean blood loss was 93. 44 cc (range 30 to 200 cc) and total hospital stay was 3. 73 days (range 3 to 6 days). Mean time to resume oral intake was 12. 5 h (range 8 to 22 h). Mean follow-up period was 21. 83 months (range 6 - 39 months). Postoperative follow-up investigations revealed successful outcome in all 16 patients, success being defined as relief of symptoms and radiological improvement, irrespective of the refluxing status. Non-refluxing status was achieved in 15 out of 16 patients as determined by micturition cystography. Conclusions: Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy is a safe and effective procedure, with inherent advantages of laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> weight-distributing <b>hitch</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "load leveling" [...] <b>hitch.</b> It is <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s).

He propositions her but Clare refuses {{to have sex with}} him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled.

40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{feasibility}} of laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with ex-tracorporeal eversion of the ureteral end in various distal ureteral lesions. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 5 laparoscopic proce-dures of ureteroneocystostomy with extracorporeal eversion of the ureteral end. Of these, 4 patients (range, 45 to 54 years) had distal ureter stricture or obstruction after gynecological surgeries for endometriosis or a large uterine myoma. One patient (male, 67 years) had low-grade distal ureter cancer. The laparoscopic procedure was combined with cystoscopic insertion of a ureteral stent and extracorporeal eversion of the ureter through the 10 -mm port on the affected side. Results: The laparoscopic ureteral reimplantations with and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> psoas <b>hitch</b> in patients with distal ureteral lesions was successful in all patients. The mean operation time was 137 minutes (range, 104 to 228 minutes). Two patients underwent additional psoas hitch.

2500|$|Since 1913, {{the company}} had been pondering over {{starting}} a motorised bus service. The main factor against its introduction was the high accident rate for a similar service in London. Finally, after years of debate, the company came to a decision on 10 February 1926, to start a bus service later that year. Bombay saw its first bus run on 15 July 1926 between Afghan Church and Crawford Market. The people of Bombay received the bus with enthusiasm, but it took quite some time before this means of conveyance really established itself. Despite stiff opposition and protests by taxi-drivers, the service ran <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hitch,</b> transporting 600,000 passengers {{by the end of}} that year. The following year the number had increased to 3.8 million. For several years, it was looked upon as transport for the upper middle class. Those were the days when the tram was the poor man's transport; it carried one all the way from Sassoon Dock to Dadar. The bus fare for the same journey was 25 paise. In response to the pleas made by the Government and the Bombay Municipal Corporation, the company extended its services to the northern part of the city in 1934. The Indian independence movement's call for mass non-violent strikes and general civil disobedience, led to regular service disruptions, leading to the company incurring huge losses in 1929. The next year was a particular bad year for the company in the wake of the Great Depression. To remain solvent, the company decided to introduce discounted fares for short routes, and increase its coverage to the northern portions of the city. In 1937, the introduction of double-decker buses proved to be extremely popular.|$|E
