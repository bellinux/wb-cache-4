5000|$|Shoddy or {{recycled}} wool is made {{by cutting}} or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers. [...] As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, <b>wool</b> <b>noil,</b> or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length. Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp. This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many years.|$|E
40|$|Noil is {{the waste}} fiber {{produced}} during combing of staple fibers, particularly wool and cotton, and {{is made up}} of short fiber, fiber entanglements, and foreign material. In worsted combing, noil levels are typically in the range 4 – 8 % for good ‘combing ’ wools, but may be as high as ~ 15 % for short or tender <b>wool.</b> <b>Noil</b> is an important economic consideration in combing because it represents lost pro-duction and for this reason has been studied over a long time [1 – 6]. A small reduction in noil, given the throughput of modern plants, represents {{a significant increase in the}} return to the comber. For example, a reduction of 0. 5 % in the noil for a wool combing plant with the capacity of 15 Mkg/year represents an increase in return of about 515, 000 AUD per year at April 2008 Eastern Market indicator prices (928 AUD/kg) [7]. The value of noil can be set a...|$|E
