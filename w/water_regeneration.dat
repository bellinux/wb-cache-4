40|$|The {{advent of}} water pinch {{analysis}} {{as a tool}} for the design of optimal water recovery network {{has been one of the}} most significant advances in the area of water conservation over the last decade. Water pinch analysis is a systematic technique for implementing strategies to maximise water reuse and recycling through integration of water-using activities or processes. In this paper, possibility of achieving complete elimination of wastewater, i. e. zero discharge is assessed through the use of <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> units. <b>Water</b> <b>regeneration</b> has been widely accepted as an effective mean to further reduce water targets in water pinch analysis. <b>Water</b> <b>regeneration</b> involves the partial or total upgrading of water purity using any purification techniques. The regenerated water can either be reused in other water-using processes or recycled to the same process to further reduce water consumption and wastewater generation. A case study on a water-intensive paper mill process is used to illustrate how the water network can be optimised to achieve zero discharge. The targeting technique of water cascade analysis is used to locate the various network targets prior to the development of detailed network design.

40|$|Brick-manufacturing is an {{intensive}} water-consuming industry {{that requires a}} sustainable and integrated water management strategy to reduce reliance on freshwater consumption. This study aims to develop a rigorous analytical tool based on water footprint principles and water pinch analysis techniques {{that can be used}} to manage and optimise water consumption. By performing thorough water audits, the water consumption footprint (the sum of blue and green water footprints) and the theoretical water pollution footprint (grey water footprint) were quantified. The total water consumption footprint of a brick is determined as 2. 02 L, of which blue water is identified as 1. 71 L (84. 8 %) and green water as 0. 31 L (15. 2 %). The theoretical grey water footprint of a brick was found to be 1. 3 L, a value that would have been higher if in-situ wastewater treatment had not been operated before effluent discharge. In order to reduce the water footprint of a brick, water pinch analysis techniques were applied for the brick-manufacturing processes. Two water recovery schemes were explored, i. e. direct re-use/recycle and <b>water</b> <b>regeneration.</b> For the former, water targeting was first carried out using the material recovery pinch diagram. Next, an algebraic technique was utilised for the targeting of <b>water</b> <b>regeneration,</b> where an interception unit is used to partially purify the water sources for further re-use/recycle. The network that fulfils the water flow rate targets was then designed using the nearest neighbour algorithm. The calculation indicates that direct re-use/recycle scheme reduces with the standard water consumption footprint reduced only by 15. 6 %. <b>Water</b> <b>regeneration</b> scheme, on the other hand improved the current value (which relies on an unsystematic <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> scheme) by 56. 4 %. The analysis clearly shows that the water consumption footprint of a brick is improved when the brick-manufacturing industry operates sustainable water management strategies. This study, a first of its kind, demonstrates that integration of water pinch analysis coupled with water footprint concepts, provides a robust and effective tool for the manufacturing industries that aim for sustainable water consumption...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a general {{superstructure}} {{and a model}} for the global optimization for the design of integrated process water networks. The superstructure consists of multiple sources of water, water-using processes, wastewater treatment and pre-treatment operations. The unique features are first, that all feasible interconnections are considered between them, including water re-use, <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> and re-use, <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> recycling, local recycling around process and treatment units. Second, multiple sources of water of different quality {{that can be used in}} the various operations are included. Third, the superstructure incorporates both mass transfer and non-mass transfer operations. The proposed model of the integrated water network is formulated as a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem for the case when 0 - 1 variables are included to model the cost of piping and/or selection of technologies for treatment. The MINLP model can be used to find optimal network designs with different number of streams in the piping network. In this work, we propose to represent the bounds on the variables as general equations obtained by physical inspection of the superstructure and using logic specifications needed for solving the model. We also incorporate the cut proposed by Karuppiah and Grossmann (2006) to significantly improve the strength of the lower bound for the global optimum. The proposed model is tested on the several illustrative examples, including large-scale problems...|$|E

40|$|Biogas {{upgrading}} {{by water}} scrubbing followed by biomethane compression is an environmentally benign process. It may be achieved using various plant configurations characterised by various power requirements with associated effects on biomethane sustainability. Therefore, {{the current study}} has been undertaken to systematically investigate the power requirements {{of a range of}} water scrubbing options. Two groups of water scrubbing are analysed: (1) high pressure water scrubbing (HPWS) and (2) near-atmospheric pressure water scrubbing (NAPWS). A water scrubbing plant model is constructed, experimentally validated and simulated for seven upgrading plant configurations. Simulation results show that the power requirement of biogas upgrading in HPWS plants is mainly associated with biogas compression. In contrast, in NAPWS plants the main power is required for water pumping. In both plants the compression of the biomethane from atmosphereic pressure to 20 MPa also contributes remarkably. It is observed that the lowest specific power requirement can be obtained for a NAPWS plant without <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> (0. 24 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas) but this plant requires cheap water supply, e. g. outlet water from a sewage treatment plant or river. The second is HPWS without flash (0. 29 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas). All other HPWS with flash and NAPWS with <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> plants have specific power requirements between 0. 30 and 0. 33 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas. Biogas compression without upgrading requires about 0. 29 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas. The thermodynamic efficiency of biogas upgrading is between 2. 2 % and 9. 8 % depending on the plant configuration while biomethane compression efficiency is higher, about 55 %. This result implies that the upgrading process has a remarkable potential for improvement whereas compression is very close to its thermodynamic limit. The potential for minimising energy dissipation in the state-of-the-art HPWS upgrading plant with flash by applying a rotary hydraulic pumping device is evaluated at about 0. 036 kW h/Nm 3 raw biogas meaning the specific power requirement reduction of 10 %.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a bilevel programming {{framework for the}} design of sustainable resource networks in eco-industrial parks (EIP). First, multiobjective optimization methods are explored in order to manage the multi-criteria nature of EIP network design problems. Then, different case studies are modeled in order to minimize and maintain in equilibrium participating plants operating costs while minimizing resource consumption. Thus, the structure of the model is constituted by a bilevel programming framework where the enterprises’ plants play a Nash game between them while being in a Stackelberg game structure with the authority. This structure defines a model which, in order to be solved, has to be transformed into a MOPEC (Multiple Optimization Problems with Equilibrium Constraints) structure. Regarding the case studies, monocontaminant water networks in EIP are studied first, where the influence of plants operating parameters are studied {{in order to determine the}} most important ones to favor the symbiosis between plants. The water network is composed of a fixed number of process and <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> units where the maximal inlet and outlet contaminant concentrations are defined a priori. The aim is to determine which processes are interconnected and the <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> allocation. Obtained results highlight the benefits of the proposed model structure in comparison with traditional multiobjective approaches, by obtaining equilibrate different plants operating costs (i. e. gains between 12 - 25 %) while maintaining an overall low resource consumption. Then, other case studies are approached by using the bilevel structure to include simultaneously energy networks in a multi-leader-multi-follower formulation where both environmental authorities are assumed to play a noncooperative Nash game. In the first case study, economic gain is proven to be more significant by including energy networks in the EIP structure. The second industrial case study explores a supply-demand utility network model where the environmental authority aims to minimize the total equivalent CO 2 emissions in the EIP. In all cases, the enterprises’ plants are encouraged to participate in the EIP by the extremely favorable obtained results...|$|E

30|$|Green spaces help to {{regulate}} the urban water cycle. The main elements of this cycle, namely evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, groundwater-recharge, subsurface flow, spring discharge and stream flow, provide the ecosystem services of <b>water</b> <b>regeneration</b> and purification {{without the need for}} large-scale technical investments. Yet building activities and an expanding transport system increase the extent of sealed surfaces, reducing possible infiltration and space for vegetation. This hinders groundwater recharge, affects the supply of freshwater and increases the amount and speed of surface runoff, thereby raising the likelihood of flooding and hence necessitating additional physical safeguards (Weller et al. 2012). One possible solution is the so-called ‘sponge city’ concept, developed in China, whereby rainwater is absorbed, stored and released in the vegetation, soil and substrate of a city much like a sponge (Wang et al. 2015). A large problem is that mining cities show an unstable flow system that occasionally may even reverse direction, so that drainage systems can break down. Therefore, well-adjusted groundwater and runoff models must be applied when designing the surface water system in such areas.|$|E

The main component of the solid desiccant dehumidifier includes two heat exchangers that are coated with silica gel RD type powders {{in order to increase}} water adsorption uptake by improving its heat and mass transfer. A series of experiment are conducted to evaluate two key performance indices, namely, moisture removal capacity (MRC) and thermal coefficient performance (COPth), under various hot and humid air conditions. Conventional granular adsorbent packed heat exchangers (GPHX) are employed to benchmark the performance of the adsorbent coated heat exchanger (PCHX).

The separating efficiency (the fraction of heptane that has phase separated from the emulsion) of ILs was investigated using bottle tests and tube tests.
