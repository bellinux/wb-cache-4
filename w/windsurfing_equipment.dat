5000|$|The {{details of}} the {{original}} designs are available in Drake's white paper on windsurfing, and these interviews with Jim Drake. Despite forty years of subsequent development, the design is still remarkably similar to today's <b>windsurfing</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the word [...] "windsurfer" [...] has become synonymous with the sport itself. There is also a video of Drake's early attempts to teach himself windsurfing.|$|E

50|$|The ideal weather {{conditions}} for formula windsurfing are flat water with winds of 7 to 25 knots; however, international rules allow racing {{in up to}} 35 knots. Sailing in chop and swell is more challenging. Due to the fragile nature of this <b>equipment,</b> <b>windsurfing</b> or launching in breaking waves is to be avoided. Due to fin length, formula boards {{should not be used}} in shallow waters.|$|R

Sea Cadet voyages normally last for 1 week, with cadets gaining RYA qualifications for their voyage.

50|$|In 1982, Montague {{moved from}} Canada to Santa Barbara, CA, {{and then to}} Maui, HI {{to pursue a career}} in windsurfing. After touring professionally in the Windsurfing World Cup, Montague began {{designing}} sails and other <b>windsurfing</b> <b>equipment</b> as Head Sail Designer at Gaastra Sails. Later, while working as the head of Research & Development at Naish, Montague became interested in the idea of using kites to harness wind power in watersports. While being involved {{in the development of the}} first kites for Naish in 1997, and helping to create a software that increased the speed of kite design modifications, Montague became an avid kitesurfer. In 2006, his interest in wind-related technology led him to engineers and fellow kitesurfers Corwin Hardham and Saul Griffith, and together they created Makani Power, an Alameda, California-based company that develops airborne wind turbines for commercial use. Makani (the Hawaiian word for “gentle breeze”) was acquired by Google X in May 2013 and is still considered a pioneer in wind powered energy systems.|$|E
5000|$|In Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd, with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fanatic Baron Marcel Bich, British courts {{recognized}} the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms {{of the modern}} windsurfer, but rather a [...] "straight boom" [...] that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was [...] "merely an obvious extension". It is worthy of note that this court case set a significant precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom, in terms of inventive step and non-obviousness; the court upheld the defendant's claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International and royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became the world’s largest producer of <b>windsurfing</b> <b>equipment,</b> with an annual production of 15,000 boards.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes {{reference}} {{to the development of}} water based board sports in the world of adventure or action games. With a specific focus on windsurfing, we use Parlebas (1999) and Warnier's (2001) theoretical interests in the praxaeology of physical learning as well as Mauss' (1935) work on techniques of the body. We also consider the implications of Csikzentimihalyi's notion of flow (1975). We argue that <b>windsurfing</b> <b>equipment</b> should not merely be seen as protection but rather as status objects through which extreme lifestyles are embodied and embodying...|$|E
40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} alike express interest in uncovering, explaining, and potentially manipulating {{the sources of}} innovation. There is empirical evidence that innovations can be developed by those holding any {{of a number of}} functional relationships to them, such as manufacturers, users, or materials suppliers. Past studies focused on industrial products; this study represents the first documentation of the sources of innovation in a consumer goods category [...] sports equipment. In this study we investigate the innovation histories of 57 important skateboarding, snowboarding, and <b>windsurfing</b> <b>equipment</b> innovations. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, equipment for new sports was not developed by existing sports equipment manufacturing companies. Innovations were instead developed by a few early and active participants in the new sports [...] lead users who built innovative equipment for themselves, their friends, and often built businesses focused on producing such equipment in order to appropriate benefit from their innovations and establish a lifestyle around the sport. We argue that the pattern of innovation observed in these fields makes sense for two reasons [...] the allocation of "sticky" information between lead users and manufacturers, and the relative expectations of innovation-related benefits held by users and manufacturers.
