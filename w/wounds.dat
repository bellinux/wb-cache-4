40|$|SummaryReactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) such as {{hydrogen}} peroxide are generated at <b>wound</b> sites {{and act as}} long-range signals in <b>wound</b> healing. The roles of other ROS in <b>wound</b> repair are little explored. Here, we reveal a cytoprotective role for mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in Caenorhabditis elegans skin <b>wound</b> healing. We show that skin <b>wounding</b> causes local production of mtROS superoxide at the <b>wound</b> site. Inhibition of mtROS levels by mitochondrial superoxide-specific antioxidants blocks actin-based <b>wound</b> closure, whereas elevation of mtROS promotes <b>wound</b> closure and enhances survival of mutant animals defective in <b>wound</b> healing. mtROS act downstream of wound-triggered Ca 2 + influx. We find that the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU- 1 is essential for rapid mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake and mtROS production after <b>wounding.</b> mtROS can promote <b>wound</b> closure by local inhibition of Rho GTPase activity via a redox-sensitive motif. These findings delineate a pathway acting via mtROS that promotes cytoskeletal responses in <b>wound</b> healing...|$|R

40|$|Background: As the <b>wound</b> {{healing is}} a multi-factorial process, the {{anesthetic}} agent and {{the duration of}} its exposure may influence the healing process after surgery. This study investigated the effect of anesthetic agents and duration of its exposure on the <b>wound</b> healing process after operation.
