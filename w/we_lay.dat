25|$|Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{denounced the}} Pharisees for their {{additions to the}} Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws <b>we</b> <b>lay</b> down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated {{to have as many}} children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E
25|$|On {{our arrival}} at Annapolis we {{embarked}} also, {{on board the}} Marquis Lafayette. When the troops were all on board, the fleet of transports, with two frigates, weighed anchor and preceded, with a fair wind, down the Chesapeake Bay till we arrived at Linhaven Bay, where the French fleet were moored. We passed {{the mouth of the}} York River, where lay two or three French frigates blockading the entrance. <b>We</b> <b>lay</b> that night at anchor with the fleet.|$|E

[...] "All I want tomorrow is peace while <b>we</b> <b>lay</b> our son to rest. Please, that's all I ask," [...] Brown's father said. The service was attended by thousands of people, including 2,500 filling the sanctuary, and others in an overflow auditorium which was also full. An estimated 2,000 additional people were on church property for the funeral. Eric Davis, one of Brown's cousins, said at the funeral, [...] "how up at the voting booths. Let your voices be heard, and let everyone know that we have had enough of all of this." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{audience}} sang a hymn, This {{stone to}} Thee in faith <b>we</b> <b>lay,</b> while an inscribed silver trowel {{was presented to}} the Earl of Dartmouth. The earl spread the mortar for the cornerstone. This cornerstone contained a cavity, and inside was a bottle containing [...] "various documents related to the laying of the stone." [...] The hole was sealed with an inscribed brass plate, which said:Glory be to God, the Son and the Holy Ghost, the foundation of this church in Thurstonland in the parish of Kirkburton, to be dedicated to His service by the name of St Thomas, was laid by Wm. Walter, Earl of Dartmouth, on the 26th July, 1869. Richard Collins, vicar of Kirkburton; Robert Boyle Thompson, curate of Thurstonland; George W. Jenkinson, churchwarden of Thurston-land, James Mallinson and Wm Swindon Barber, architects.|$|E
2500|$|Importantly, the ready-to-hand only {{emerges from}} the prior {{attitude}} in which we care {{about what is going}} on and we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there [...] "in order to" [...] do something. In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can <b>we</b> <b>lay</b> appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
2500|$|The hymn, This {{stone to}} thee in faith <b>we</b> <b>lay,</b> was sung, {{and in his}} sermon Rev,. J.W. Bardsley spoke about {{the way in which}} the mass {{movement}} of people to cities had had a consequence in which [...] "large numbers of the people of England had grown up in habits of non-attendance in the House of God," [...] and this had caused the Church of England to split city parishes and build more churches. He said that in the 1881 Census the population of the Huddersfield parish was 9,201, and that number had increased greatly since the Census. Moreover, the Parish Church had only 500 free seats. This was the reason why the parish had been split, and St Mark's built as an extra church, on land given by Sir John Ramsden. He said that poorer people had [...] "collected considerable sums of money by means of collecting cards." [...] He told the parish congregation that they must raise sufficient funds for the remaining building work, and for an endowment as well. They then sang, Christ is our corner stone. The collection was £42 1s 1d. The treasurer Mr E. Armitage said that they had been promised subscriptions of about £4,800, but that they needed £6,000 to cover the endowment. They had incurred liabilities of around £4,000, and they needed another £1,200. They had received nearly £3,700 in hard cash, but they had had to buy out the leaseholder of the land that they'd been given. So the congregation was constrained, in an area of much poverty, to raise more funds.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not only}} the volume of {{material}} that was a challenge in writing for radio, but the reality that they were writing for more than simply the audience. It was an era when radio and television shows often had only a single sponsor and since the sponsor paid the show's bills the writer had to please them as well. Block expressed this double-edged sword with his definition of a sponsor as: [...] "A golden goose for whom <b>we</b> <b>lay</b> the eggs." [...] It didn't end with the sponsor. [...] "We have to make the sponsor laugh," [...] Block wrote in Collier's magazine [...] "And besides pleasing the sponsor, we have to please the sponsor's wife, the producer, the men from the advertising agency, the radio and television critics and the Federal Communications Commission." [...] Then there was the issue of radio censorship. Block once quipped that if he tried to produce a radio version of It Happened One Night, a film famous for a scene of an unmarried couple sharing a bedroom, it would end up being called It Didn't Happen One Night. Even during his time with the BBC, Block later recalled the occasion when a cannibal sketch he'd written was rejected by the British Home Office. The note justifying the rejection explained they objected to his depicting cannibals because they were [...] "loyal subjects of the king {{and many of them are}} now aiding in the fight against the enemy." [...] However, in this case the rejection was reversed, apparently by an executive with a sense of humor, since the explanation for the reversal noted that the cannibals had also eaten many loyal subjects.|$|E
