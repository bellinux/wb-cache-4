They {{took off and}} headed to the Danish coast. Out-to-sea he spotted, and was likely seen, by German coastal ships. As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight <b>whine</b> in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched <b>whine,</b> which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young <b>whine</b> and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until {{eighteen}} months after publication. Children’s <b>whining</b> is identified in extracts of video-recorded social interaction {{at home with}} siblings, parents and other family. “Whining” is primarily a vernacular category, but can be identified {{in terms of a}} set of phonetic features including pitch movement, loudness and nasality, and contrasted with crying. We focus on the uses and consequences of <b>whining,</b> in and for social interaction. Rather than identifying and attributing experiential causes or correlates of <b>whining,</b> we examine what children do with it, how it is occasioned, and how others, mostly parents, respond to it. <b>Whining</b> performs actions such as objecting to transgressions and thwarted goals, and making complaints. Parental reactions include one or more of: “stance inversion,” which is the adoption of a contrasting tone in next turn; formulations of the offending circumstances; orientations to remedying the problem; and rejection of the <b>whine’s</b> basis, including dispositional formulations of the child’s <b>whining</b> (e. g., being “grumpy”), and accounts for not complying with a called-for remedy. Data are in English...|$|R

5|$|The {{well-known}} {{character of}} Pauline Fowler {{has also been}} referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the EastEnders universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama This Life. Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of EastEnders on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans. The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, The Real McCoy (1991–1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of EastEnders, with black comedians taking over roles of well known EastEnders characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon {{played the role of}} Pauline. The sketches placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to <b>whine.</b> The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in BBC Two sitcom Beautiful People (2008).|$|E
5|$|As in {{all other}} tetrapods, mammals have a larynx that can quickly open and close to produce sounds, and a supralaryngeal vocal tract which filters this sound. The lungs and {{surrounding}} musculature provide the air stream and pressure required to phonate. The larynx controls the pitch and volume of sound, but the strength the lungs exert to exhale also contributes to volume. More primitive mammals, such as the echidna, can only hiss, as sound is achieved solely through exhaling through a partially closed larynx. Other mammals phonate using vocal folds, {{as opposed to the}} vocal cords seen in birds and reptiles. The movement or tenseness of the vocal folds can result in many sounds such as purring and screaming. Mammals can change the position of the larynx, allowing them to breathe through the nose while swallowing through the mouth, and to form both oral and nasal sounds; nasal sounds, such as a dog <b>whine,</b> are generally soft sounds, and oral sounds, such as a dog bark, are generally loud.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to <b>whine</b> about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

25|$|Contact calls: Grunting noises which {{differ in}} {{intensity}} {{according to the}} situation. Adult males are usually silent, while females frequently grunt and piglets <b>whine.</b> When feeding, boars express their contentment through purring.

The maxillary palps of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females’ maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the Culicinae.) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in the males whereas the females’ is only about 60% silver.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, <b>whine,</b> and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a puff of smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, <b>whine,</b> or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E

There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) <b>whine</b> day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling?

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and the <b>whine</b> of Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
