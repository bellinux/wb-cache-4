25|$|This mood is {{actively}} used in modern Lithuanian {{and one of}} its functions corresponds to the English conditional mood. The conditional mood is used to describe a hypothetical action that could take place if certain conditions were met (hence the name) or a desired action in present or in future: Panaikinus muitus, sumažėtų prekių kainos – Having eliminated customs duties, prices would go down. Conditional mood is used in conditional (if) sentences; this usage requires conditional mood in subordinate and main clauses if both actions are perceived as hypothetical: Visi laimėtų, jeigu priimtumėte šį pasiūlymą. – There would be a <b>win-win</b> <b>situation</b> for everyone if you accepted this offer.|$|E

They expect a flurry of joint ventures with global majors for expansion capital and opportunity to gain expertise in supply chain management. Spencer's Retail with 200 stores in India, and with retail of fresh vegetables and fruits accounting for 55 per cent of its business claims retail reform to be a <b>win-win</b> <b>situation,</b> as they already procure the farm products directly from the growers the involvement of middlemen or traders. Spencer’s claims that there is scope for it to expand its footprint in terms of store location as well as procuring farm products. Foodworld, which operates over 60 stores, plans to ramp up its presence to more than 200 locations. It has already tied up with Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm International. With the relaxation in international investments in Indian retail, India’s Foodworld expects its global relationship will only get stronger. Competition and investment in retail will provide more benefits to consumers through lower prices, wider availability and significant improvement in supply chain logistics.|$|E

The President congratulated the pilgrims for {{successfully}} completing the journey and praised the Chinese Muslim Association as an important asset of Taiwan, saying that the association has successfully promoted the frequent contacts and exchanges between Taiwan and the Muslim worlds, and serves as the communication window for Taiwan to those nations. He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The core value of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added that in recent years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a <b>win-win</b> <b>situation</b> for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will pay close attention to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

This paper {{explores the}} possibility of using marine reserves to protect stocks subject to bycatch problems. The importance of migration rates and growth rates of both target and bycatch species and costs are analyzed. Pure open access equilibrium harvest of target species and stock level of bycatch species are compared to those generated by a reserve and open access in the harvest zone. <b>Win-win</b> <b>situations,</b> situations where both harvest of target species and stock size of bycatch species increase, are searched for. It is shown that using a reserve to protect a slow moving bycatch species {{is more likely to be}} a success than in the case of a fast moving bycatch species. Furthermore, a fast moving species is worse off after the introduction of a reserve if it has an intrinsic growth rate that is lower than the target species, and in some cases a reserve may actually drive the bycatch stock to extinction. No <b>win-win</b> <b>situations</b> are found in the case of a fast moving species.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{several examples}} of projects with potential for enhancing environmental improvement {{aside from the}} traditional growthoriented objectives. For instance, if an integrated pest management (IPM) component can be included in an irrigation project, it can bring environmental benefits other than increased agricultural production. Irrigation projects are traditionally considered as economic growth-oriented projects with increased agricultural output as the objective. With the introduction of IPM systems to an irrigation project, it can (i) increase inland fish production, (ii) bring benefits of reduced cost for agro-chemicals, (iii) improve water quality in the area, and (iv) improve nutritional status of the rural poor. These additional benefits can be complementary to the traditional benefits (i. e., increased agricultural production) of the project. This chapter focuses on the improvement of project design through the incorporation of environmental enhancement components to traditional or growth-oriented projects. For additional consideration see Box 8. I. Three Possible Scenarios Not every project/intervention, however, is always capable of bringing these kinds of positive environmental impacts. In principle there can be three types of project interventions: (i) <b>win-win</b> <b>situations,</b> (ii) trade-off situations, and (iii) worse-off <b>situations.</b> In <b>win-win</b> <b>situations,</b> not only can the intervention increase the benefits of traditional objectives {{but it can also}} contribute positively to the improvement of environmental quality or natural resource conservation.

Eco-effi cient and socially inclusive infrastructure can: • be a driver of economic growth and competitiveness • increase employment opportunities • contribute to poverty alleviation • improve quality of life • enhance energy security • improve the environment • avoid future costs and risks.

Doing this in an inclusive way guarantees equal opportunities for all people. Deliver services to all Applied to infrastructure, the concepts of eco-effi ciency and inclusiveness are concerned with expanding the access to and quality of services, such as housing, transport, energy, water and waste treatment, while reducing costs and environmental problems, such as pollution, ineffi cient energy use and traffi c congestion.
