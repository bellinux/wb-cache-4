5|$|During {{his first}} year in office <b>Williams</b> <b>and</b> his {{government}} suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for <b>Williams</b> <b>and</b> his government dramatically improved in 2005.

5|$|In the Republican gubernatorial primary, the Williams-Farmer ticket {{defeated}} businessman Phil Moffett {{and former}} Jefferson County Judge/Executive Bobbie Holsclaw. <b>Williams</b> <b>and</b> Farmer had led in opinion polling {{throughout the entire}} campaign, and neither opposing slate was able to raise enough money to engage in statewide television advertising; despite this, <b>Williams</b> <b>and</b> Farmer received only 68,502 votes, 48.2% of those cast. Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson, which contains the city of Louisville and is the state's most populous. Moffett, a Tea Party favorite, carried the second most populous county, Fayette (which contains Lexington), as well as heavily-populated Daviess, McCracken, and Warren counties, and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose.

Because Williams may have left no will, the disposition of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. <b>Williams</b> <b>and</b> her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E
