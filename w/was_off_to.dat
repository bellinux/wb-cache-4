5|$|When the 2016–17 season started, Harden <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a great {{start and}} was widely {{considered}} a top MVP runner along with Kawhi Leonard plus former teammate Russell Westbrook. When the season ended, the Rockets were third in both the Western Conference and overall rankings, a major improvement from the season before. D'Antoni was named the NBA Coach of the Year, Eric Gordon the Sixth Man of the Year, and Harden finished second in MVP voting to Russell Westbrook. In the playoffs, the Rockets faced the sixth seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in a battle of the MVP frontrunners, as the winner was not announced until after the finals. The Rockets won the series 4–1 including Nene Hilario's perfect 12–12 in field goals in Game 4. But {{they went on to}} lose to the San Antonio Spurs in a six-game series, despite blowing out the Spurs in game 1 by 27 points. The Spurs tied the series 2-2 and held on to win game 5 as Manu Ginobili blocked James Harden's game tying three point attempt as time ran out, and won game 6 by 39 points, as with Nene's injury, the Rockets could not guard Lamarcus Aldridge, who scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|In the opener, Florida <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a shaky start, but {{was able}} to defeat the 45-point underdog Houston Cougars 4521. The defense was suspect, {{surrendering}} 421 total yards to a Cougar team which won a single game the year before.|$|E
25|$|While Thornton <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{a strong}} start production-wise (33 points in 24 games), the Bruins were {{struggling}} in the standings. On November 30, 2005, Thornton {{was traded to}} the San Jose Sharks in a four-player deal, which sent forwards Marco Sturm and Wayne Primeau and defenceman Brad Stuart to Boston in exchange for the Bruins captain. Thornton was the team's leading scorer at the time by a substantial margin.|$|E

After a short period of training, he <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war on the Western Front. On 21 November, he was wounded by {{shrapnel}} and removed from front line duty. He recuperated first at a hospital in Laon, France, then at the Reserve Military Hospital in his home town of Dresden.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a better start. They had achieved victories against Temple, Duke, Air Force, and Pittsburgh. Losses against Rutgers, Ball State, Wake Forest, and Delaware put them 4–4 on the season. With four games {{remaining in the}} season, Navy needed to win at least two {{in order to be}} invited to a bowl game. The Poinsettia Bowl had arranged for the Midshipmen to play in that bowl if they reached six wins.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate line {{of about}} four miles of fortifications faced the southerly facing {{portion of the}} Union line (the part {{occupied}} by Steedman and Schofield). From right to left were the corps of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee, and Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart. Cavalry commanded by Brig. Gen. James R. Chalmers <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the southwest of the city. The Confederate left flank was secured by five small detached redoubts, each having two to four guns with garrisons of about 150 men each.|$|E

25|$|From there, Simons <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Madison {{to attend}} the University of Wisconsin, majoring in English. While at the university, Simons {{developed}} an interest in politics and history and transferred to the School of Economics, Political Science, and History, newly established by Richard T. Ely, to pursue the subject further. In {{the course of his}} education, Simons was exposed to socialist ideas, working as an assistant for the liberal Ely on his book Socialism, published in 1894. Simons also later regarded the courses taken from Frederick J. Turner as influential for having instilled the notion of class struggle in his pattern of thinking.|$|E
25|$|Pope Alexander IV and the Curia {{continued}} to live in Naples, until {{the first week of}} June 1255 when they returned to Anagni, and it was not until mid-November that the Pope was back in Rome. There the Curia stayed until the end of May, 1256, when it <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Anagni for the summer, until the beginning of December. The problem was that Rome was in the hands of Senator Brancaleone degli Andalo, Count of Casalecchio, since 1252, and the Ghibbelines and Alexander was repeatedly driven out by unruly mobs. Rome was home again until the end of May, 1257, until the summer vacation at Viterbo began. The vacation lasted until the end of October, 1258, when the Court visited Anagni again; they stayed until the beginning of November, 1260. The Pope then was able to reside at the Lateran until the first week of May, 1261, when the Court <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Viterbo again. Alexander IV died at Viterbo on 25 May 1261. A total of nineteen months was spent in Rome, {{out of a total of}} seventy-eight months. Alexander had created no new cardinals, and so the Electoral meeting following his death had only eight participants. The Election was a long-drawn-out one, lasting from 25 May to 29 August 1261. Unable to agree on one of themselves, the Cardinals chose Jacques Pantaléon, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, since 1255, was Papal Legate with the Crusade in the Holy Land. He became Pope Urban IV, and was crowned at Viterbo on 4 September 1261.|$|E
25|$|For Evernham's {{full-time}} {{debut in}} 2001, Atwood was named {{as the driver}} of the 19 car, teammate to Bill Elliott in the No. 9. The team was part of Dodge's return into NASCAR, with Dodge Dealers sponsoring the entire season. The year <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a sluggish start when Atwood failed to qualify at the spring Atlanta race, but picked up steam {{towards the end of the}} year, winning the pole at Phoenix International Raceway, and almost winning the Homestead race before relinquishing the lead to teammate Elliott late in the race. Atwood barely missed wrestling the rookie of the year crown away from Kevin Harvick, despite Harvick finishing much higher in the points (ninth) and winning twice.|$|E

25|$|Another {{first was}} Michener's state visit in 1971 to Trinidad and Tobago; while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II had both carried out state visits {{on behalf of}} Canada and {{previous}} governors general had made official visits abroad, no Canadian governor general had ever previously undertaken such a trip. Then, in October of the same year, the Governor General <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Iran to attend the Iranian monarchy's 2,500th anniversary. These voyages initially caused controversy among diplomatic insiders in Ottawa, who viewed it as inappropriate for someone who was not technically the country's head of state to undertake a state visit. However, the successes of the trip helped end the controversy, and established a precedent thereafter followed in Canada, and adopted by other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Bangladesh {{toured the}} West Indies. Mortaza's {{captaincy}} <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a winning start {{in his first}} Test in charge when Bangladesh beat the West Indies. However, he injured his knee {{and was unable to}} take to the field on the final day, leaving Shakib Al Hasan to assume the captaincy and lead the team to a historic win; it was their first against the West Indies, their first overseas Test victory, and only their second Test win. This was achieved against a very inexperienced West Indies side {{as a result of a}} dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and the West Indies Players' Association over pay. The first XI had made themselves unavailable for selection and a new squad had to be chosen. Seven West Indies players made their Test debut in the match and the side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier.|$|E
25|$|After {{three months}} serving as {{commander}} of the Cavalry Corps, beginning in May 1915, at which time he was also made a temporary lieutenant-general, Byng <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Gallipoli to head the IX Corps and supervise the successful British, Australian, and New Zealand forces withdrawal from the ill-fated campaign. For this, he was on 1 January 1916 elevated within the Order of the Bath {{to the rank of}} Knight Commander, but was not allowed much rest, as he spent the next month commanding the Suez Canal defences before returning to the Western Front to lead the XVII Corps. By June, he was in command of the Canadian Corps and was promoted when, for distinguished service, the King made substantive Byng's rank of lieutenant-general. Byng's greatest glory then came when he, along with his subordinate officer, the Canadian Major-General Arthur Currie, led the Canadian victory in April 1917 at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, an historic military milestone for the Dominion that inspired nationalism at home.|$|E

25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a round of applause from both judges. Then it <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
500|$|In the {{standard}} Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered {{at a small}} number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] Then it <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed {{two or three times a}} week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.|$|E
