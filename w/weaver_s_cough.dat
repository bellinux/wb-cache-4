40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana. The studied association represents a stratigraphic link between the Tithonian records of Steinmanella from the Picún Leufú Formation and the Late Valanginian to Hauterivian records from the Agrio Formation.

Initially, a modified Franz cell was used, where sections of human nail served as the barrier through which drug penetrated into an agar-filled chamber infected with dermatophytes. A second study was performed using a novel infected nail model where dermatophytes grew into human nail and adenosine triphosphate levels were used as biological marker for antimicrobial activity. The novel enhancing system Recura increased the permeation of both existing drugs through human nail sections mounted in a modified Franz cell. Furthermore, the infected nail model also confirmed that the system also enhanced the permeation through infected nail resulting in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels superior (P ??? 0. 05) to Penlac generic and equivalent (P > 0. 05) to the commercial comparator Jublia. This study demonstrated that with the use of a novel permeation-enhancing formulation base, Recura enhances delivery of miconazole and fluconazole when applied ungually such that the efficacy was equivalent or superior to commercial comparators.

A crucial part of an optical link is a modulator, a device that converts an electrical signal into an optical signal. This thesis explores the physics of how these modulators operate. I built a general purpose optical and electrical testing station to perform these measurements. The optical transmission spectra of the set of modulators studied had extinction ratios {{in the range of}} 5 to 27 dB, which is sufficient for modulation. I developed analytical and T-Matrix models to extract physical parameters from the transmission scans, such as light transmission, loss in the ring, and index of refraction of the contact section. The modulators worked with an open eye up to frequencies of 600 MHz. A theoretical model was developed to match the data and experiment with injection and recombination dynamics. Finally, several design solutions are suggested to further improve the modulators and to move towards the goal of modulators that operate at 5 Gb/s. by Matthew J. <b>Weaver.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)

40|$|In {{the last}} four decades of the past century Mexico created {{increasingly}} more comprehensive policies for forest management. Yet, mismanagement and environmental degradation continued with no great improvement in production or efficiency.

40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} influenza (or flu) from a patient's {{cough and}} exhaled air causes potential flu virus transmission to the persons located nearby. Hospital-acquired influenza {{is a major}} airborne disease that occurs to health care workers (HCW). This paper examines the airflow patterns and influenza-infected cough aerosol transport behavior in a ceiling-ventilated mock airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and its effectiveness in mitigating HCW's exposure to airborne infection. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the airflow patterns and the flu virus dispersal behavior in a mock AIIR is conducted using the room geometries and layout (room dimensions, bathroom dimensions and details, placement of vents and furniture), ventilation parameters (flow rates at the inlet and outlet vents, diffuser design, thermal sources, etc.), and pressurization corresponding {{to that of a}} traditional ceiling-mounted ventilation arrangement observed in existing hospitals. The measured data shows that ventilation rates for the AIIR are about 12 air changes per hour(ach). However, the numerical results reveals incomplete air mixing and that not all of the room air is changed 12 times per hour. Two life-sized breathing human models are used to simulate a source patient and a receiving HCW. A patient cough cycle is introduced into the simulation and the airborne infection dispersal is tracked in time using a multiphase flow simulation approach. The results reveal air recirculation regions that diminished the effect of air filtration and prolong the presence of flu-contaminated air at the HCW's zone. Immediately after the patient <b>coughs</b> (0. 51 <b>s),</b> the <b>cough</b> velocity from the patient's mouth drives the cough aerosols toward the HCW standing next to patient's bed. Within 0. 7 s, the HCW is at risk of acquiring the infectious influenza disease, as a portion of these aerosols are inhaled by the HCW. As time progresses (5 s), the aerosols eventually spread throughout the entire room, as they are carried by the AIIR airflow patterns. Subsequently, a portion of these aerosols are removed by the exhaust ventilation. However, the remaining cough aerosols reenter and recirculate in the HCW's zone until they are removed by the exhaust ventilation. The infectious aerosols become diluted in the HCW's region over a period of 10 s because of the fresh air supplied into the HCW's zone. The overall duration of influenza infection in the room (until the aerosol count is reduced to less than 0. 16 % {{of the total number of}} aerosols ejected from the patient's mouth) is recorded as approximately 20 <b>s.</b> With successive <b>coughing</b> events, a near-continuous exposure would be possible. Hence, the ceiling-ventilation arrangement of the mock AIIR creats an unfavorable environment to the HCW throughout his stay in the room, and the modeled AIIR ventilation is not effective in protecting the HCW from infectious cough aerosols. The CFD results suggest that the AIIR ceiling ventilation arrangement has a significant role in influencing the flu virus transmission to the HCW.

We conducted a cross-sectional, general population-based survey in 11 985 subjects from 17 countries. We measured spirometric lung function and assessed health status using the Short Form 12 questionnaire. The physical and mental health component scores were calculated. Subjects with COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity < 0. 70, n = 2269) had lower physical component scores (44 ± 10 versus 48 ± 10 units, p< 0. 0001) and mental health component scores (51 ± 10 versus 52 ± 10 units, p = 0. 005) than subjects without COPD.

40|$|Published online 25 February 2016 Increasing {{evidence}} that the maternal environment influences the programming of developing embryos and fetuses through epigenetic mechanisms has significant potential application in the broiler industry. The broiler breeder hen is subjected to restricted-feeding regimes to maximise egg quantity and quality, but the genetically high-intake potential of these birds makes this regime a stressful one. We propose that this stress is signalled to the developing embryo via changes in yolk composition as an evolutionary adaptation to changing environments, and that exposure {{to high levels of}} corticosteroids in ovo is associated with developmental reprogramming, which has effects on the behaviour, health and growth of the progeny. The present paper describes some preliminary results from a series of trials designed to elucidate the relationship between breeder hen diet and egg composition, and the growth, behaviour and immune function of the progeny. We conclude that manipulation of the breeder hen diet is an untapped opportunity to maintain the competitiveness of the chicken meat industry and further, that achieving improved productivity by this means may be compatible with improved animal welfare outcomes for the hen and her progeny.

40|$|When {{infectious}} epidemics occur, {{they can}} be perpetuated within health care settings, potentially resulting in severe health care workforce absenteeism, morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. The ventilation system configuration of an airborne infection isolation room is one factor that {{can play a role}} in protecting health care workers from infectious patient bioaerosols. Though commonly associated with airborne infectious diseases, the airborne infection isolation room design can also impact other transmission routes such as short-range airborne as well as fomite and contact transmission routes that are impacted by contagion concentration and recirculation. This article presents a computational fluid dynamics study on the influence of the ventilation configuration on the possible flow path of bioaerosol dispersal behavior in a mock airborne infection isolation room. At first, a mock airborne infection isolation room was modeled that has the room geometry and layout, ventilation parameters, and pressurization corresponding to that of a traditional ceiling-mounted ventilation arrangement observed in existing hospitals. An alternate ventilation configuration was then modeled to retain the linear supply diffuser in the original mock airborne infection isolation room but interchanging the square supply and exhaust locations to place the exhaust closer to the patient source and allow clean air from supply vents to flow in clean-to-dirty flow paths, originating in uncontaminated parts of the room prior to entering the contaminated patient's air space. The modeled alternate airborne infection isolation room ventilation rate was 12 air changes per hour. Two human breathing models were used to simulate a source patient and a receiving health care worker. A patient cough cycle was introduced into the simulation, and the airborne infection dispersal was tracked in time using a multi-phase flow simulation approach. The results from the alternate configuration revealed that the cough aerosols were pulled by the exhaust vent without encountering the health care worker by 0. 93 <b>s</b> after patient <b>coughs</b> and the particles were controlled as the aerosols' flow path was uninterrupted by an air particle streamline from patient to the ceiling exhaust venting out cough aerosols. However, not all the aerosols were vented out of the room. The remaining cough aerosols entered the health care worker's breathing zone by 0. 98 s. This resulted in one of the critical stages in terms of the health care worker's exposure to airborne virus and presented the opportunity for the health care worker to suffer adverse health effects from the inhalation of cough aerosols. Within 2 <b>s,</b> the <b>cough</b> aerosols reentered and recirculated within the patient and health care worker's surroundings resulting in pockets of old contaminated air. By this time, coalescence losses decreased as the aerosol were no longer in very close proximity and their movement was primarily influenced by the airborne infection isolation room airflow patterns. In the patient and health care worker's area away from the supply, the fresh air supply failed to reach this part of the room to quickly dilute the cough aerosol concentration. The exhaust was also found to have minimal effect upon cough aerosol removal, except for those areas with high exhaust velocities, very close to the exhaust grill. Within 5 - 20 s after a patient's cough, the aerosols tended to break up to form smaller sized aerosols of less than one micron diameter. They remained airborne and entrained back into the supply air stream, spreading into the entire room. The suspended aerosols resulted in the floating time of more than 21 s in the room due to one cough cycle. The duration of airborne contagion in the room and its prolonged exposure to the health care worker is likely to happen due to successive coughing cycles. Hence, the evaluated alternate airborne infection isolation room is not effective in removing at least 38 % particles exposed to health care worker within the first second of a patient's cough.

General practitioners' decision of whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic was congruent with the guideline in 52 % of consultations and the antibiotic choice congruence was 51 % of antibiotic prescriptions. Hence, a congruent prescribing decision and a prescription of recommendation was found in only 25 % of antibiotic prescriptions. Split by diagnosis we found that around three quarters of antibiotics prescribed for cough (73 %) and acute bronchitis (78 %) were not congruent to the guidelines. In contrast to that around one quarter of antibiotics prescribed for community acquired pneumonia (28 %) were not congruent to the guidelines.

40|$|This Fragile Land, though {{written for}} a popular audience, is not {{intended}} for children or for light bedtime reading. In language midway between academic discourse and good literary prose, Paul Johnsgard characterizes the plant and animal communities of the Sandhills thoroughly- and with humor and imagination. Part One describes the 2 ̆ 2 geology and historical geography 2 ̆ 2 of the Sandhills region and its borders; {{it is the only}} part that might be tedious for some. In his preface, Johnsgard advises readers to begin with Part Two and skip-and-sample backward. In five chapters, he details the geographic relationships of species 2 ̆ 7 habitats to one another and to the geologic features of the Sandhills themselves and the lands to the immediate north, west, south, and east. Part One is dry as blowsand, and readers who plod rather than skip may want the aid of one or two drinks. In Part Two, Johnsgard displays his gifts as a gossip and storyteller; here we get the lowdown on the neighbors, things like the mating rituals of grebes and the surprising viciousness of the grasshopper mouse. We learn that after the male brook stickleback 2 ̆ 7 s troubles in building a home, the first thing the female does is poke her head through the back wall; we learn that cliff swallows lay eggs in one another 2 ̆ 7 s nests, and that their oldest colonies are so infested with bedbugs that survival chances are better out in the burbs. Even the plant world is made fascinating as the author describes the struggle of plants on the higher slopes to avoid being either buried or excavated as the wind moves sand. Part Three consists of two cautiously worded chapters that plead for better management of the soil and groundwater. Johnsgard remarks on Nebraska state government 2 ̆ 7 s delays in implementing federal environmental law, and he tabulates the dangerously rising levels of nitrate and atrazine. But the author 2 ̆ 7 s wails are muffled, and the book ends with a conciliatory paragraph in which one can almost hear the professor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> apologetic <b>cough.</b> The text proper is followed by a valuable reference section that includes a substantial compilation of appendices, a fourteen page bibliography, and two indexes. Taken together, these references amount to a hundred pages or a good two-fifths of the book, and it is here that those who wish to fight environmental battles will find ammunition...|$|R

Nevertheless, close examination of its immunophenotypic profile by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) and potential relationship between antigens, as well as histologic grade, has not been extensively assessed by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FC). We examined the immunophenotypic profile, including heavy and light chain analysis, of 41 nodal FL cases with FC analysis and tissue diagnosis. Additionally, MFI of CD 45, CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, and CD 10 were examined. The relationship between the antigen expression on FL cells and normal B cells in the same sample, and any association with each other or with histologic grade, were analyzed statistically. We observed brighter CD 45 and CD 20 expression in FL than normal B cells (P < 0. 0001); dimmer CD 19 in FL than normal B cells (P = 0. 03); brighter CD 20 in grade 2 than grade 1 histology (P = 0. 0023). No correlation was observed between CD 10 MFI and other antigens. Increased expression of CD 20, CD 45, and dim expression of CD 19 are features of nodal FL. FC assessment of MFI detects subtle changes in antigen expression not entirely apparent by visual examination of dot plots or immunohistochemistry. MFI {{is a means of}} uncovering subtle but unique immunophenotypic features in both well-known, and less well-defined neoplastic hematolymphoid entities.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} has been refined to a crystallographic residual of 16. 1 % at 1. 6 A resolution. The structure has a Kunitz-type fold and {{is composed of}} 12 antiparallel beta-strands, 6 of which form a beta-barrel. One bound sulfate ion has been identified in the model, hydrogen bonded to the side chains of Asn 27, Arg 120, and Lys 125. The side chain of Arg 120 has two conformations, both of which permit hydrogen bonds to the sulfate. This sulfate binding site has been suggested as the binding site for heparin (Eriksson, A. E., Cousens, L. <b>S.,</b> <b>Weaver,</b> L. H., & Matthews, B. W., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3441 - 3445). Two beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) molecules are also included in the model, each forming a disulfide bond to the S gamma atoms of Cys 69 and Cys 92, respectively. The side chain of Cys 92 has two conformations of which only one can bind BME. Therefore the BME molecule is half occupied at this site. The locations of possible sulfate binding sites on the protein were examined by replacing the ammonium sulfate in the crystallization medium with ammonium selenate. Diffraction data were measured to 2. 2 A resolution and the structure refined to an R-factor of 13. 8 %. The binding of the more electron-dense selenate ion was identified at two positions. One position was identical to the sulfate binding site identified previously. The second selenate binding site, which is of lower occupancy, is situated 5. 6 A from the first. This ion is hydrogen bonded by the side chain of Lys 135 and Arg 120. Thus the side chain of Arg 120 binds two selenate ions simultaneously. It is suggested that the observed second selenate binding site should also be considered as a possible binding site for heparin, or that both selenate binding sites might simultaneously contribute to the binding of heparin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the need for a}} pointcut for parallelizable loops in an aspect-oriented programming environment. Several prototype solutions exist for loop pointcuts, but the solutions are not very granular. In particular, they are not able to differentiate between loops that are parallelizable and those that are not. Being able to identify parallelizable loops automatically, as part of an aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 s weaving process, is particularly important because (1) manually identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem and (2) aspectizing parallelized loops can lead to a reduction in code tangling and an increase in separation of concerns. This paper describes the concepts behind the loop-pointcut problem. It then describes the approach used in this study for implementing a solution {{in the form of an}} aspect-oriented Java compiler with a parallelizable loop pointcut. Identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem, and as such, this study 2 ̆ 7 s parallelizable loop pointcut implements a heuristic solution. The pointcut identifies many parallelizable loops as being parallelizable, but in erring on the side of conservatism, there are some parallelizable loops that the pointcut is unable to identify as parallelizable. To test the parallelizable-loop pointcut, the pointcut was applied to a benchmark set of parallelizable programs. There were two versions of each benchmark program - (1) an aspect-oriented version, where the aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weaver</b> added the multi-threading functionality, and (2) a non-aspect-oriented version, where the benchmark program 2 ̆ 7 s source code directly implemented the multi-threading functionality. For each benchmark program, the output from the aspect-oriented version was compared to the output from the non-aspect-oriented version. The study found that each loop that was deemed parallelizable by the aspect-oriented benchmark program was executed in parallel (with multiple threads) by both versions of the program - the aspect-oriented version and the non-aspect-oriented version. There were some loops in the non-aspect-oriented benchmark programs that were deemed parallelizable and executed in parallel, but those same loops were deemed non-parallelizable by their associated aspect-oriented benchmark program. This discrepancy is explained by the study 2 ̆ 7 s conservative approach to identifying loops as parallelizable...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{shearing}} {{of sheep}} is labour-intensive, expensive and presents significant occupational {{health and safety}} risks. The only alternative at present is based on injection of epidermal growth factor, which severs the fibre at the follicle level. This technology cannot be used in pregnant animals and requires application of a net to retain the severed fleece. An alternative is to create a weakened zone within the wool staple, which would be sufficiently strong to retain the fleece on the sheep while a protective covering regrows, but sufficiently weak as to allow painless and automated removal of the fleece. We demonstrate that this approach is possible using mixtures of amino acids lacking lysine and methionine. Initially we demonstrate the relationships between staple strength, a subjective ‘harvestability’ score and a subjective ‘pain’ score, using fleeces from animals treated with varying levels of cortisol to create a wide range of strengths of wool attachment. We assigned a score to the ease with which we could manually break the staples, and also to the animal’s response to breaking the staples still attached to the skin. The relationships between these variables indicated that a staple was considered harvestable and could be removed with minimal skin flinch response at a staple strength of ~ 10 – 13 N/kTex. Staples within this range were then produced by intravenous infusion of mixtures of amino acids lacking in lysine and methionine for a 5 -day period. The weak point was uniformly created across the entire fleece and when a prototype rollerpin device was applied to the weakened wool, it uniformly broke the fleece of the three sheep tested. The mode of action of the amino acid treatment on wool growth was studied. There was no effect of unbalanced amino acids on the rate of follicle bulb cell division, the number of active wool follicles, or the length of the keratinisation zone in the wool follicle. Fibre diameter was reduced by ~ 4 microns by treatment, and intrinsic fibre strength (strength relative to cross-sectional area of the wool fibres), was reduced by ~ 50 %. Results of these trials are encouraging but further work is required to develop a practical, on-farm method of altering systemic amino acid supply and to design an automated, high-throughput system of severing the weakened wool.

Coker 1 1 Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK, 2 Center for Space Medicine and Extreme Environments Berlin, Berlin, Germany This {{research}} was presented by {{representatives from the}} Alaska chapter of the American College of Sports Medicine. PURPOSE: The Yukon Arctic Ultra is considered the longest and coldest ultraendurance event in the world. Recently, cold exposure and exercise {{have been reported to}} influence circulating levels of certain myokines and proteins that may influence the “browning” of white adipose tissue. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of the Yukon Arctic Ultra (430 mile participants) on serum irisin, meteorin, IL- 6, and FGF 21 in healthy individuals. METHODS: Eight male and female participants (mean±SEM; age = 44 ± 3 yr; BMI = 23. 3 ± 0. 9) were recruited for participation. Blood samples were collected at pre-event, mid event (200 mile) and post-event checkpoints. RESULTS: The average temperature during the event ranged from - 45 ºC to - 8 ºC. Due to the challenging conditions, only 50 % of the participants finished the event and they lost 2. 2 ± 0. 3 kg of body weight. Serum irisin was 307 ± 63 ug/ml (pre-event), rose to 496 ± 17 ug/ml (mid-event), and remained elevated at 513 ± 18 (post-event) but the lack of significance was likely due to attrition. Serum meteorin remained stable at 3. 1 ± 0. 1 ng/ml (pre-event), 3. 1 ± 0. 0 (mid-event), and 3. 0 ± 0. 1 ng/ml (post-event). Serum IL- 6 fell from 183 ± 51 ug/ml (pre-event), to 118 ± 55 ug/ml (mid-event), to 90 ± 39 ug/ml (post-event). Serum FGF 21 was 30 ± 3 ug/ml (pre-event), 34 ± 8 ug/ml (mid-event), and 62 ± 21 ug/ml (post-event). CONCLUSION: The combined influence of cold exposure and extreme levels of prolonged ultraendurance exercise may promote elevations in serum irisin and FGF 21, while IL- 6 may decline under these circumstances. Despite previous reports in pre-clinical studies of cold exposure induced increments in serum meteorin, these responses were not evident in a limited number of humans undergoing substantially greater metabolic stress. Utilizing participants competing in all distances of Yukon Arctic Ultra 2016 and hot-weather marathons, future studies are planned to gather more data on serum myokines, and examine potential changes in FNDC 5 and PGC- 1 α in muscle and UCP- 1 gene expression in white adipose tissue...|$|R
40|$|Youth {{environmental}} education (EE) {{is at least}} 40 years old and outdoor education is even older (Carter & Simmons, 2010). While few studies have documented the lasting impacts of these programs on youth participants as they have grown into adulthood, the broad goals of {{environmental education}} to inspire and enable life-long environmental stewardship necessitate such long-term research. Retrospective studies with environmentalists and environmental educators, {{as well as with}} the general public, suggest that childhood experiences in nature are linked to adult environmental attitudes and behaviors (Wells, & Lekies, 2012). These studies provide conceptual support for outdoor and environmental education, but do not document the lasting impacts of specific programs. This dissertation expands on prior research in interpretation (i. e., Knapp, 2007), investigating what past participants remember from a residential outdoor environmental education (ROEE) program, and draws on a new body of literature to explore how participants use these memories in subsequent years. The first article (chapter) is a literature review that summarizes and critiques (1) studies broadly focused on life experiences that have influenced adult environmental attitudes and behaviors and (2) long-term evaluations of interpretive, outdoor education, and environmental education programs. The second article reports data from 45 retrospective interviews with adults who participated in a fifth-grade ROEE program between 1958 and 1992. This paper focuses on what participants remember from the experience, looking specifically at the characteristics of remembered program components. Experiences that were active, offered opportunities for iii achievement, involved social interactions, and were both distinctive and applicable at home were found to be particularly memorable. The third article in this dissertation considers how people use their memories of ROEE, reporting the results of 54 retrospective interviews at two research sites with teens who had attended ROEE programs five years earlier. The psychological literature suggests that autobiographical episodic memories serve directive, social, and self functions (Bluck, 2003), and this dissertation research documents memories of ROEE being used to understand and appreciate wild nature, to direct outdoor recreation and environmental conservation behaviors, and to reminisce with friends. Considered together, the research presented in this dissertation offers insight into how current educators can design memorable programs and then encourage memory use. References Bluck, S. (2003).
