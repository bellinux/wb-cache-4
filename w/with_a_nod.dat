25|$|After an aborted {{recording}} {{session with}} Andrew Eldritch {{in the summer}} of 1985, Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams left the Sisters of Mercy. Based in Leeds, the duo continued to work on various musical ideas and recorded them over the autumn. Dismissing the use of a drum-machine, Adams and Hussey asked Mick Brown (Red Lorry Yellow Lorry) to help out with the sessions. By the end of the year, he had joined the band on a permanent basis. With Hussey as both the frontman and principal songwriter, the trio required a second guitarist to facilitate a live set-up. They eventually recruited Simon Hinkler (Artery) who also contributed keyboards and thus completed the four-piece. The name 'The Sisterhood' was chosen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to past and rehearsals for the first shows started in January 1986. The new name quickly became a point of discussion in the English music-press, giving the four-piece significant amount of publicity. As 'The Sisterhood' the band made their live-debut on January 20, 1986 at the , London.|$|E
500|$|The temple is an {{octagonal}} domed building <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to the Pantheon, Rome, {{constructed in}} undecorated brick {{with a single}} east-facing entrance.

500|$|In October 2011, Smith {{spoke to}} Q Radio {{about the new}} album. [...] "It's {{still going to be}} fairly electronic, I think, {{compared}} to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Justin Meldal-Johnsen, longtime bassist for Beck and Nine Inch Nails, who has previously produced records for M83 and Neon Trees. In an interview with Electronic Musician, Meldal-Johnsen stated he wanted [...] "the album to sound very visceral {{and a little bit}} less locked down and computerized, more 1981 than 2012, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to 2016." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, Taylor York stated [...] "I don't think we've ever been so proud and satisfied with something we've done." [...] On June 29, 2012, the band had confirmed that former Nine Inch Nails and current Angels & Airwaves drummer Ilan Rubin would be recording drums for the album.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Hudson and {{two other}} Sisters of her congregation, Carol Gilbert, O.P., and Ardeth Platte, O.P., entered Peterson Air Force Base without {{authorization}} and sprinkled blood on a fighter plane. The trio was caught and arrested. They were then held in a federal prison until the charges were dropped {{because there was no}} lasting damage was done to the airplane. Gilbert claimed that the base was part of the [...] "Star Wars" [...] defense system and the government did not want to draw unnecessary attention to the area. In 2002, the same group of nuns gained access to a Minuteman III missile silo in Colorado. Wearing white hazmat suits emblazoned with [...] "Citizen Weapon Inspection Team," [...] they pounded on the missile, drew a cross in their own blood and prayed for peace. At their pre-trial hearing, the Sisters, dressed in their religious habit, engaged in silent protest by only answering the judge <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod.</b> When their trial came about, the presiding judge, Robert E. Blackburn, granted an in limine motion to the prosecutor preventing the Sisters from arguing that their actions were legal under international law and the Nuremberg defense. The group was sentenced to between 31 and 40 months for obstructing national defense and damaging government property. The sister's appeal was rejected in 2005 by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E

2500|$|A Century of [...] Progress was {{organized}} as an Illinois nonprofit corporation in January 1928 {{for the purpose}} of planning and hosting a World's Fair in Chicago in 1934. City officials designated three and a half miles of newly reclaimed land along the shore of Lake Michigan between 12th and 39th streets on the Near South Side for the fairgrounds. Held on a [...] portion of Burnham Park, the $37,500,000 exposition was formally opened on May 27, 1933 by US Postmaster General James Farley at a four hour ceremony at Soldier Field. The fair's opening night began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to the heavens. Lights were automatically activated when the rays of the star Arcturus were detected. The star was chosen as its light had started its journey at about the time of the previous Chicago world's fair—the World's Columbian Exposition—in 1893. The rays were focused on photoelectric cells in a series of astronomical observatories and then transformed into electrical energy which was transmitted to Chicago.|$|E

2500|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} by Walter Becchia and Lucien Gerard, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to the classic BMW boxer motorcycle engine. It was an air-cooled, flat-twin, four-stroke, 375cc engine with pushrod operated overhead valves and a hemispherical combustion chamber. The earliest model developed [...] DIN (6.5kW). A 425cc engine was introduced in 1955, followed in 1968 by a 602cc one giving [...] at 7000rpm. With the 602cc engine, the tax classification of the car changed so that it became a 3CV, but the name remained unchanged. A 435cc engine was introduced {{at the same time}} to replace the 425cc; the 435cc engine car was named 2CV 4 while the 602cc took the name 2CV 6 (a variant in Argentina took the name 3CV). The 602cc engine evolved to the M28 [...] in 1970; this was the most powerful engine fitted to the 2CV. A new 602cc giving [...] at a slower 5,750rpm was introduced in 1979. This engine was less powerful, [...] and more efficient, allowing lower fuel consumption and better top speed, at the price of decreased acceleration. All 2CVs with the M28 engine can run on unleaded petrol.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, a {{few years}} later, Hazltt saw fit to {{conclude}} his assessment of the [...] "spirit of the age" [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to Knowles. Acknowledging his long friendship with the dramatist, he puts forth his belief that Knowles's Virginius is [...] "the best acting tragedy that has been produced on the modern stage." [...] Knowles himself is [...] "the first tragic writer of the age" [...] because he keeps his ego out of his plays; following no rules and having read few plays, he has observed closely what little of life he has experienced, and then, aided by the practice of having been an actor himself, he focuses intensely on his subject and pours into his plays the [...] "impulses of [...] natural feeling, and produces a perfect work of art." [...] On a personal basis, Hazlitt concludes, the man is so self-effacing that you {{would never be able}} to connect his plays with his personality without knowing the fact that he is their author. In a brief version of the kind of personal focus he adds to most of the essays in The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt reflects that, when not focused on his drama, Knowles lives a retired life: he modestly [...] "divides his time and affections between his plots and his fishing tackle, between the Muses' spring, and those mountain-streams which sparkle like his own eye, that gush out like his own voice at the sight of an old friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Atlantic {{decided to}} send the new Drifters into the studio, Ertegün and Wexler were too busy to produce the sessions, so they enlisted Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had been {{successful}} producing the Coasters. With Leiber & Stoller producing, this new lineup — widely considered the [...] "true" [...] golden age of the group — released several singles with King on lead that became chart hits. [...] "There Goes My Baby", the first commercial rock-and-roll recording to include a string orchestra, was a Top 10 hit, and number 193 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. [...] "Dance with Me" [...] followed, and then [...] "This Magic Moment" [...] (number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960). [...] "Save the Last Dance for Me" [...] reached number 1 on the U.S. pop charts and number 2 in the UK. It was followed by [...] "I Count The Tears". This version of the Drifters {{was inducted into the}} Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000 as Ben E. King and the Drifters. The write-up indicates an award primarily as a tribute to Ben E. King <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nod</b> to his time in the Drifters, only one of five paragraphs being exclusively devoted to the Drifters, although Charlie Thomas was also cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame's induction of the original Drifters, which technically was only through 1958).|$|E
