That he has not really {{attracted}} the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him {{from the beginning of}} the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.|$|E
25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie {{has a hard time}} accepting that they are real. He <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a pole dancer and {{subsequent}} road into alcoholism. This {{was a result of}} her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader (Ben Geurens) along with her new relationship with Cameron [...] "Cam" [...] Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), who was leading her astray. The story line began playing out from the 2006 [...] "cliffhanger" [...] episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life. Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: [...] "I think she is so naive, she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work." [...] Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: [...] "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible." [...] Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl. Gordon commented that [...] "I think everyone in this show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they turn you into a glamour puss." ...|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

In the pilot episode, he was the [...] "new kid" [...] in Aberdale and could not wait to make friends. He {{is the kind of}} person who listens to and follows his heart, reacting toward life with unfailing excitement and enthusiasm. Sweet, good-natured, sympathetic, and very helpful, Clarence cares deeply for the well-being of others and enjoys helping people with their problems, often by using unorthodox methods to do so. He is however, not without his faults, namely a tendency to let his imagination get the better of him, and to pry into people's personal lives. Clarence has a wide range of interests and hobbies, and despite sometimes coming off as a goofball, has an underlying intelligence. He is also missing his two front teeth, which perhaps explains why he speaks with a lateral lisp.|$|E

60|$|Do not too hastily {{say that}} this is inconceivable. To Circumstantial Selection all {{mechanical}} and chemical reactions are possible, provided you accept the geologists' estimates of the great age of the earth, and therefore allow time enough for the circumstances to operate. It is true that mere survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence plus sexual selection fail as hopelessly to account for Darwin's own life work as for my conquest of the bicycle; but who can prove that there are not other soulless factors, unnoticed or undiscovered, which only require imagination enough to fit them to the evolution of an automatic Jesus or Shakespear? When a man tells you that you are a product of Circumstantial Selection solely, you cannot finally disprove it. You can only tell him out of the depths of your inner conviction that he is a fool and a liar. But as this, though British, is uncivil, it is wiser to offer him the counter-assurance that you are the product of Lamarckian evolution, formerly called Functional Adaptation and now Creative Evolution, and challenge him to disprove that, which he can no more do than you can disprove Circumstantial Selection, both forces being conceivably able to produce anything if you only give them rope enough. You may also defy him to act for a single hour on the assumption that he may safely cross Oxford Street in a state of unconsciousness, trusting to his dodging reflexes to react automatically and promptly enough to the visual impression produced by a motor bus, and the audible impression produced by its hooter. But if you allow yourself to defy him to explain any particular action of yours by Circumstantial Selection, he should always be able to find some explanation that will fit the case if only he is ingenious enough and goes far enough to find it. Darwin found several such explanations in his controversies. Anybody who really <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the universe has been produced by Circumstantial Selection co-operating with a force as inhuman as we conceive magnetism to be can find a logical excuse for his belief if he tries hard enough.|$|E
