500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth?</b> You <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth?!</b> You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

I <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> to be made available to everyone, for anyone young and old, who may want to do research into Ryan's case or research on the issue of capital punishment. I will go to my grave firmly of the opinion that Ronald Ryan did not commit murder. I refuse to believe that at any time he told anyone that he did".|$|E

60|$|But she, though loving as ardently as he, <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> above all.

Tiffany has a lot of growing up to do.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the themes}} {{of the novel is}} the {{difficulty}} of <b>the</b> search for <b>Truth.</b> Flavia <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> but is misled by prejudice, rumour and ambiguous prophecy. Jonathan accuses Flavia of putting her desire to know before her concern for individuals. He thinks he knows <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> but is mistaken. Messallinus seeks <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> through torture, but obtains only lies. Domitian seeks truth by trickery but hears only a flawed theory. Even the direct approach through scientific investigation {{in the form of an}} autopsy yields two possible explanations, of which the most palatable is accepted by the emperor.|$|R
