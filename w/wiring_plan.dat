40|$|Abstract—As {{technology}} {{advances and}} the number of interconnections among modules rapidly increases, timing closure, and design convergence are the most important concerns. Hence, it is desirable to consider interconnect optimization as early as possible. Previous work for this issue can be classified into two directions: <b>wire</b> <b>planning</b> and buffer-block planning for interconnect-driven floorplanning. <b>Wire</b> <b>planning</b> for interconnect-driven floorplanning does not consider buffer insertion, and buffer-block planning for interconnect-driven floorplanning cannot overcome the limitation of a bad initial floorplan. In this paper, we first address simultaneous floorplanning and buffer-block planning (i. e., integrating buffer-block planning into floorplanning) for interconnect optimization. We adopt simulated annealing to refine a floorplan so that buffers can be inserted more effectively. In each iteration, we construct a routing tree for each net, allocate buffers for all nets, introduce corresponding buffer blocks into the intermediate floorplan, and invoke Lagrangian relaxation to optimize area and satisfy timing requirements. Further, {{in order to reduce the}} problem size, we present supermodule partitioning which partitions modules into supermodules. Experimental results show that our method of integrating buffer-block planning into floorplanning can significantly improve the interconnect delay and reduce the number of buffers needed. Based on a set of MCNC benchmark circuits, our approach achieves an average success rate of 86. 1 % of nets meeting timing constraints, inserts only 272 buffers on average, and consumes an average extra area of only 0. 28 % over the given floorplan, compared with the average success rate of 62. 6 %, 1123 buffers, and extra area of 1. 05 % resulted from a famous recent work presented at ICCAD’ 99.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} track routing and {{optimization}} for yield (TROY), the first track router for the optimization of yield loss due to random defects. As {{the probability of}} failure (POF), which is an integral of the critical area and the defect size distribution, strongly depends on wire ordering, sizing, and spacing, track routing can {{play a key role}} in effective <b>wire</b> <b>planning</b> for yield optimization. However, a straightforward formulation of yield-driven track routing can be shown to be integer nonlinear programming, which is a nondeterministic polynomial-time complete problem. TROY overcomes the computational complexity by combining two effective techniques, i. e., the minimum Hamiltonian path (MHP) from graph theory and the second-order cone programming (SOCP) from mathematical optimization. First, TROY performs wire ordering to minimize the critical area for short defects by finding an MHP. Then, TROY carries out optimal wire sizing/spacing through SOCP optimization based on the given wire order. Since the SOCP can be optimally solved in near linear time, TROY efficiently achieves globally optimal wire sizing/spacing for the minimal POF.
