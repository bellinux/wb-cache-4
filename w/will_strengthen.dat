5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} {{for the creation of}} a UNPA is enhancing UN accountability and legitimacy. The United Nations System spent more than $1.8 billion of public money in 2005 and its own auditors have pointed out that it lacks adequate internal controls to protect against waste, fraud and mismanagement. By holding hearings, issuing reports, and passing resolutions, the UNPA could exercise oversight over other UN bodies. In a September 2007 press release, MEP Graham Watson expressed his hope that [...] "in an era where the UN's mandate has grown exponentially the UNPA would act as a watch-dog on its activities, monitoring its decision-making deadlines, its accountability and transparency". London Mayor Ken Livingstone promised that, [...] "a more democratic United Nations as envisaged by this campaign <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> the accountability and legitimacy of the UN." [...] The Pan African Parliament's resolution mirrored this sentiment: [...] "If democratization is a major means to legitimize and improve national governance, it is also the most reliable way to legitimize and improve international organization, making it more open and responsive by increasing participation." ...|$|E

[...] According to the Committee for a Democratic UN, [...] "The UNPA concept is the a first step towards a democratic world parliament". World federalists typically view an empowered democratic assembly as a means of preventing war by providing everyone a peaceful means of pursuing their political objectives. Walter Cronkite, for instance, said, [...] "Within the next few years, we must change the basic structure of our global community from the present anarchic system of war and ever more destructive weaponry to a new system governed by a democratic U.N. federation." ...|$|E
500|$|At 0000UTC on September5, Gabrielle {{reached its}} maximum {{sustained}} wind speed of 145mph (230km/h), though the barometric pressure was {{slightly higher than}} late on September3. A hurricane hunter aircraft flown into the storm on September5 reported that hurricane force winds extended 100miles (161km) from the center and tropical storm force winds 250miles (402km). At the time, Gabrielle was recurving west-northwest at 15mph (24km/h). Hours later, another recon flight into Gabrielle revealed that the barometric pressure was slowly rising and the eye began to expand which is sign that the storm was slowly weakening. However, forecasters were unsure if the weakening was temporary or definite, prompting one meteorologist to say that [...] "Gabrielle may have reached its peak intensity, but its too early to tell", to explain the uncertainty of Gabrielle’s strength and if the storm <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> even further. The storm passed northeastward of the Leeward Islands and turned northward {{in response to a}} weakening in the ridge of high pressure caused by Hurricane Felix. Early on September7, Gabrielle was downgraded to a Category3 hurricane. [...] Only six hours later, the storm further weakened to a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

500|$|Doomfist is {{the first}} villain {{introduced}} to the Overwatch fictional universe. In the backstory of the third Doomfist, Akande Ogundimu is presented as the villainous heir to a prosthetics company in Nigeria who splits his time between expanding the company and martial arts training. During the game's [...] "Omnic War" [...] between humans and rogue Omnic robots, Ogundimu lost his right arm. His prosthetic replacement impressed the second Doomfist (Akinjide Adeyemi), who then trained Ogundimu as his successor, but the student later killed his teacher to claim the gauntlet for himself. Ogundimu became {{a leader of the}} Talon group, the nemesis organization to Overwatch, and advocates for his belief that forces of conflict <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> humanity. At some point prior to the game's present, Overwatch's Winston, a playable character from the game, defeats Doomfist and puts the titular gauntlet behind glass in the Overwatch museum, as referenced in the original Overwatch announcement video. Blizzard's first teaser for Doomfist's release shows a fictional news report about Talon freeing Doomfist from prison to steal the gauntlet. Blizzard had modified the Numbani level during its release of Orisa, the previous playable character released for the game, to imply that Doomfist had attacked the city and stolen the gauntlet; notably, the payload casing had been broken open and the gauntlet missing.|$|E

Stivetts joined a pitching rotation that already included future Baseball Hall of Fame members John Clarkson and Kid Nichols, as well as veteran Harry Staley. With Boston's solid pitching staff, and their potent mix of position players consisting of future Hall of Fame members and established veterans, the team was expected to compete for a second consecutive NL championship. When analyzing the 12National League teams, New York Giants captain, Buck Ewing, remarked about Boston's roster, [...] "I think Clarkson has seen his better days. Jack Stivetts <b>will</b> <b>strengthen</b> them wonderfully. He {{is one of the}} best pitchers in the country to-day." [...] In Stivetts' first start of the season on April23, his pitching was described as [...] "wild", as he issued six bases on balls. He prevailed, however, and Boston won by the score of 11–7. Four days later, he was victorious again, and Boston's W–Lrecord stood at 10–1after their first 11games. On June23, he hit his first home run of the season, along with a double, in a 13–6victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The Pittsburg Dispatch reported on July1 that Stivetts was leading Boston hitters in batting at that point in the season.|$|E
