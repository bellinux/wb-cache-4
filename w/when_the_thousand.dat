60|$|When Sir Lionel {{heard that}} George was named {{as one of}} the executors, he looked up at his son triumphantly; but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousand</b> pounds were named, his face became rather long, and less {{pleasant}} than usual. A man feels no need to leave a thousand pounds to an executor if he means to give him the bulk of his fortune.|$|E
50|$|The Thousand Character Classic {{has been}} used as a primer for {{learning}} Chinese characters for many centuries. It is uncertain <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Thousand</b> Character Classic was introduced to Korea.|$|E
25|$|Artifacts {{from the}} First Temple Period (c. 960 – 586 BC) were {{destroyed}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> {{of tons of}} ancient fill from the site were dumped in the Kidron Valley and Jerusalem's municipal garbage dump, {{making it impossible to}} conduct archaeological examination.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} later we {{advanced}} on the town Huarina, a great host of us, and outside of it met the yet greater host of Urco in a mighty battle that endured {{for a day and}} a night, and yet, like that of the Field of Blood, remained neither lost nor won. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>the</b> dead had been buried and the wounded sent back to Cuzco, we attacked the city of Huarina, I leading the van with my Chancas, and stormed the place, driving Urco and his forces out on the farther side.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Ten <b>Thousand</b> {{started their}} journey in 401 BC, Xenophon {{tells us that}} they {{numbered}} around 10,400. At the time Xenophon left them two years later, their number had dwindled to just under 6,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{single most}} {{dramatic}} {{moment of the}} protests in Quebec came {{on the first day}} of <b>the</b> summit, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of protesters who had marched through the city finally reached “the wall. ” Until that point no one had seen a single cop. Now, a phalanx of riot police, armed to the teeth with tear gas, pepper bombs and plastic bullets, waited silently behind the chain-link fence. There was a momentary pause, and then hundreds of masked activists–ranging from black-clad anarchists to Mohawk Warriors–descended on the wall itself, produced grappling hooks and wire cutters, and began to systematically tear it down...|$|R
50|$|Lucy Webb Hayes National Training School had {{its origin}} in a thought which was {{expressed}} at Spiegel Grove <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> were gathered {{there for the}} funeral services of Mrs. Hayes, who, as {{the wife of a}} President of the United States, and {{as the president of the}} Woman’s Home Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had endeared herself to US women. The remembrance of the deep interest which Mrs. Hayes had manifested in the training of women as missionaries suggested the founding of a school to carry out this purpose as a suitable monument to her memory.|$|R
50|$|The {{university}} library {{has been in}} existence since 1971 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first <b>thousand</b> volumes were housed in an unused church building {{in the village of}} Gaborone. The first official building was opened in 1986, which was two stories tall and contained only five computers.|$|R
5000|$|... 411 BC: The {{democracy}} in Athens is overthrown {{and replaced by}} the oligarchic Council of Four Hundred. This council is itself soon defeated and order is almost restored, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Five <b>Thousand</b> start ruling. Early next year, they are also overthrown and the old democracy is restored.|$|R

60|$|But {{the strangest}} fact {{connected}} with French or indeed with human Suspicion, is perhaps this of Camille Desmoulins. Camille's head, {{one of the}} clearest in France, has got itself so saturated through every fibre with Preternaturalism of Suspicion, that looking back on that Twelfth of July 1789, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> rose round him, yelling responsive at his word in the Palais Royal Garden, and took cockades, he finds it explicable only on this hypothesis, That they were all hired to do it, and set on by the Foreign and other Plotters. 'It was not for nothing,' says Camille with insight, 'that this multitude burst up round me when I spoke!' No, not for nothing. Behind, around, before, it is one huge Preternatural Puppet-play of Plots; Pitt pulling the wires. (See Histoire des Brissotins, par Camille Desmoulins, a Pamphlet of Camille's, Paris, 1793.) Almost I conjecture that I Camille myself am a Plot, and wooden with wires.--The force of insight could no further go.|$|R
50|$|His {{power of}} swaying a large {{multitude}} by oratory was demonstrated at the 19th International Eucharistic Congress, held in London in 1908, <b>when</b> he quieted <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of assembled Roman Catholics who were infuriated at the government's {{interference with the}} proposed procession of the Blessed Sacrament {{in the streets of}} Westminster.|$|R
2500|$|Some Israeli archaeologists {{also charged}} that archaeological {{material}} {{dating to the}} First Temple Period (c. 960-586 BCE) was destroyed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of tons of ancient fill from the site were dumped into the Kidron Valley, as well as into Jerusalem's municipal garbage dump, where it mixed with the local garbage, {{making it impossible to}} conduct archaeological examination. They further contended that the Waqf was deliberately removing evidence of Jewish remains. For example, Dr. Eilat Mazar told Ynet news that the actions by the Waqf were linked to the routine denials of the existence of the Jerusalem Temples by senior officials of the Palestinian Authority. She stated that, [...] "They want to turn the whole of the Temple Mount into a mosque for Muslims only. They don't care about the artifacts or heritage on the site." [...] However, Seligman and Gideon Avni, another Israeli archaeologist, told Archaeology magazine that while the fill did indeed contain shards from the First Temple period, they were located in originally unstratified fill and therefore lacked any serious archaeological value.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008, the Dukes' lease of Wahconah Park was jeopardized <b>when</b> <b>the</b> city demanded <b>thousands</b> of dollars in back {{maintenance}} fees owed by the franchise. The situation was corrected, and the Dukes' lease of the park continued through the 2008 season.|$|R
50|$|The area {{remained}} large {{expanses of}} rural farmland until the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fire sent <b>thousands</b> of city dwellers {{into what is}} now west suburban Chicago. Land sold for only $2 an acre, which made areas such as Countryside a welcome respite from the congestion and industry in Chicago.|$|R
50|$|On top of {{the general}} Catholic {{suspicion}} of Jews at <b>the</b> time, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of French members of the People's Crusade arrived at the Rhine, they {{had run out of}} provisions. To restock their supplies, they began to plunder Jewish food and property while attempting to force them to convert to Catholicism. Not all crusaders who had run out of supplies resorted to murder; some, like Peter the Hermit, used extortion instead. While no sources claim he preached against the Jews, he carried a letter with him from the Jews of France to the community at Trier. The letter urged them to supply provisions to Peter and his men. The Solomon bar Simson Chronicle records that they were so terrified by Peter’s appearance at the gates that they readily agreed to supply his needs. Whatever Peter's own position on the Jews was, men claiming to follow after him felt free to massacre Jews on their own initiative, to pillage their possessions. Sometimes Jews survived by being subjected to involuntary baptism, such as in Regensburg, where a crusading mob rounded up the Jewish community, forced them into the Danube, and performed a mass baptism. After the crusaders had left the region these Jews returned to practicing Judaism.|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, {{they did}} not seek an {{adjournment}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Crown delivered <b>thousands</b> of pages of additional unused material on the first morning of the trial. Waddington recalled: [...] "the unused material {{did not include the}} results of tests on Mr Kiszko's semen which were then {{in the hands of the}} Police and showed that Mr Kiszko was not the murderer".|$|R
50|$|He {{was allowed}} to spend {{the last years of}} his life in the United States, only {{returning}} once to England when he came to consecrate the Church of St Sava in 1952, an occasion <b>when</b> Serbs in <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> rallied from <b>the</b> mines and factories of England to the walls of the great church in Ladbroke Grove. The sacred edifice was packed and the overflow crowd streamed {{all the way to the}} London Underground, with Velimirović's voice sounding through the air on loudspeakers.|$|R
5000|$|The Albanian {{government}} {{declared it}} a [...] "natural disaster" [...] on 5 January 2010 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> flooding displaced <b>thousands</b> of people. <b>The</b> Shkodër District reached a critical situation {{as the water}} level on main roads entering into the region reached one meter and reached two meters inside the village of Berdices. The overflow of water alienated the city from national road access and cut communication with the town.|$|R
60|$|The buyer beckoned to the {{man with}} her who stood in the corner, his face hidden by the shadow, and he dragged forward the second basket, which he had already unstrapped from his shoulders. Here also were {{lettuces}}, and beneath <b>the</b> lettuces gold. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> full two <b>thousand</b> sestertia were counted, that is, over fifteen thousand pounds of our money, this second basket still remained {{more than a third}} full.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew well}} the {{psychology}} of the little thing, and it was the little things by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge of madness. I have seen Harrison called from his bunk to put properly away a misplaced paintbrush, and the two watches below haled from their tired sleep to accompany him and see him do it. A little thing, truly, but <b>when</b> multiplied by <b>the</b> <b>thousand</b> ingenious devices of such a mind, the mental state {{of the men in the}} forecastle may be slightly comprehended.|$|R
5000|$|July 1928 saw {{the inauguration}} of first {{auditorium}} of this kind in <b>the</b> department <b>when</b> more <b>the</b> a <b>thousand</b> people attended a performance of Gounod's opera, Mireille. The building is constructed of reinforced concrete, and centred on an open-air amphitheatre, which {{is the basis for}} its name [...] "Atrium". The bar is decorated with windows by Louis Barillet (1880 - 1948), then well known in France for his mastery of Stained glass.|$|R
50|$|Fountain {{originally}} cast in 1858 by Hardy & Padmore {{and intended}} {{to relieve the}} heat in the market hall. Found to be leaking at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> hall needed <b>thousands</b> of pounds to repair it so it wasn't a priority, so after a year's delay and {{at a cost of}} £300 it was re-erected in the park. It was restored in 2004 at a cost of £28,000 and the lion masks were replaced.|$|R
6000|$|... 8 What heart can {{conceive}} {{the glorious}} worship of heaven?

60|$|Major Talbot {{was of the}} old, old South. The {{present day}} had little {{interest}} or excellence in his eyes. His mind lived in that period before <b>the</b> Civil War, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Talbots owned <b>thousands</b> of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> family mansion {{was the scene of}} princely hospitality, and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the South. Out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour, an antiquated and punctilious politeness, and (you would think) its wardrobe.|$|R
50|$|One night, Tony becomes {{drunk in}} the company of a woman {{reporter}} and boasts he will jump out of an airplane at 15000 ft with his hands handcuffed behind his back. When she prints his claim, he first tries to get out of it with a fake cast on his arm, but <b>when</b> he sees <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of fans, he goes through with it, freeing himself in mid-air and parachuting safely to the ground. He promises Anita that he will not attempt the dangerous stunt again, but soon breaks his word and performs it repeatedly all over the world.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, the J.D. Power UK Car Customer Satisfaction Index reviews all {{cars that}} have reached {{two years of}} age {{at the time of}} publication. Surveys are {{conducted}} in partnership with UK automotive publication What Car?, which publishes the survey results. The UK car survey consists of comments and ratings entirely from the members of the public who bought the cars new two years previously. Satisfaction is based on a number of different criteria, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> many <b>thousands</b> of marks in each area for each car are added up to form an overall score. [...] The list usually comprises about 130 cars and is published every year in the United Kingdom. The survey was produced in conjunction with the BBC's Top Gear Magazine for many years until the mid-2000s (decade).|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of it, in the Piazza di Bra--a spirit of old time among the {{familiar}} realities of the passing hour--is the great Roman Amphitheatre. So well preserved, and carefully maintained, that every row of seats is there, unbroken. Over certain of the arches, the old Roman numerals may yet be seen; and there are corridors, and staircases, and subterranean passages for beasts, and winding ways, above ground and below, as <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fierce <b>thousands</b> hurried in and out, intent upon the bloody shows of the arena. Nestling {{in some of the}} shadows and hollow places of the walls, now, are smiths with their forges, and a few small dealers of one kind or other; and there are green weeds, and leaves, and grass, upon the parapet. But little else is greatly changed.|$|R
40|$|Although the Election Act of 1915 enabled non-Indigenous {{women as}} well as men to stand as {{candidates}} for Queensland’s Lower House, no woman took up this opportunity until Irene Longman’s successful bid in 1929. In the 31 Queensland elections held between 1918 and 2004, women were, until very recently, a tiny minority <b>when</b> compared to <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of examples of male candidates for the same period. This paper examines the promises of the 1915 Elections Act, its position as part of the legislation framework that recognised political rights for {{women as well}} as men, and its inception in Parliment and the community. It also offers an overview of the subsequent history of women’s attemps to stand for Queensland’s Parliment...|$|R
50|$|The Fort Howard Veterans Hospital sat on {{the site}} of Fort Howard, a site that saw {{military}} action dating back to the War of 1812 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> British landed <b>thousands</b> of men there as the precursor to the Battle of Baltimore. In August 1940 the Veterans Administration (VA) acquired the title to the fort, and began moving operations there in January 1941. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> VA took over the site, the Medical Corps building was renovated to be the nurses’ home, infirmary, and attendants’ quarters. From 1925 to 1928 that nurses' home was the headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur. The hospital officially opened for patient care in 1943.|$|R
5000|$|Almost each of {{the musicians}} {{mentioned}} are represented by a corresponding instrument: Ravi Shankar by a sitar sounding electric guitar, The Who by electric guitars and drums, Hugh Masekela by a trumpet, The Grateful Dead, by electric guitars, and Jimi Hendrix by a different sounding electric guitar. The sound of a distortion of the guitars is heard <b>when</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ten <b>thousand</b> electric guitars" [...] are playing. The Strings come in on the line: [...] "You wanna find the truth in life,/ Don't pass music by,/ And you know I would not lie", sounding like a Hindu chant.|$|R
5000|$|... (1988) Bob Wiseman Sings Wrench Tuttle: In Her Dream (Atlantic Records). The album {{created some}} notoriety <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first <b>thousand</b> copies were {{destroyed}} by Warner Music due to the song [...] "Rock and Tree" [...] which was feared libelous. It was about the murder of Salvador Allende and mentioned Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Donald M. Kendall, the president of Pepsi Cola. [...] "Wrench Tuttle", the credited lyricist, was a Wiseman pseudonym. (Wiseman claimed that he set music to words by Tuttle, a poet who would send him lyrics in the mail.) The album {{was included in the}} Canadian music critics top 100 albums of all time [...] The album yielded the video [...] "We Got Time", with cameos by iconoclast Mendelson Joe and friends, Tracy Wright (for whom Wiseman wrote the 2013 song mothface@yahoo.ca, Don McKellar, Leslie Spit Treeo and Mary Margaret OHara. The album also featured [...] "Airplane on the Highway" [...] which had an accompanying video by Caroline Azar and animator Lisa Bujoin.|$|R
60|$|While he did so, Juanna {{turned and}} looked behind her. Far below them {{she could see the}} forms of Olfan and his companions {{standing}} shoulder to shoulder, and even catch the gleams of light reflected from their spears, for now the sun was rising. Beneath them again she saw the grass-grown roofs of that earthly hell, the City of the People of the Mist, and the endless plain beyond through which the river wandered like a silver serpent. There also was the further portion of the huge wall of the temple built by unknown hands in forgotten years, and rising above the edge of that gap in the cliff through which she was looking, appeared a black mass which she knew to be the head and shoulders of the hideous colossus, on whose dizzy brow she had sat in that strange hour <b>when</b> <b>the</b> shouting <b>thousands</b> thundered a welcome to her as their goddess, and whence her most beloved friend, Francisco, had been hurled to his cruel death.|$|R
