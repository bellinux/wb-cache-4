5|$|South Dakota summers bring {{frequent}} thunderstorms {{which can}} be severe with high winds, thunder, and hail. The {{eastern part of the}} state is often considered part of tornado alley, and South Dakota experiences an average of 29 tornadoes per year. Winters are somewhat more stable, although severe <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of blizzards and ice storms can occur during the season. Severe <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state can occasionally turn deadly. Between 1950 and 1994, 11 people were killed by tornadoes in the state, and the 1972 Black Hills flood tore through central Rapid City, killing 238 people and causing {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in damage.|$|E

One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period immediately following the storm.|$|E

40|$|The rate of {{sandstone}} <b>weathering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-arid {{climate of}} the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia has been estimated from observations of gravestone <b>weathering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The gravestone data points to two distinct stages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> process. The first stage covering the first century of exposure is characterised by a relatively low recession rate of 0. 5 mm/ 100 years. This {{is followed by a}} second stage <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> rate of weathering increases sharply to ca 2. 5 mm/ 100 years. The non-linear nature of the weathering trends over time suggests that during the first century of exposure, structural changes took place within the sandstone material, which lay the foundation for accelerated weathering after further exposure. Laboratory trials were also conducted to identify the effectiveness of different <b>weathering</b> processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decay of sandstone in this region. Of the four processes examined, only the freeze-thaw cycle produced a significant degree of mass loss and is therefore most likely a strong contributor to <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> of sandstone <b>in</b> this region...|$|R

The 1,027 missions conducted during October was 19 percent higher than the previous record.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

Portions of Texas and Oklahoma experienced over 5inches (127mm) of rain, while southern Arkansas received over 10inches (255mm) of rainfall.

5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe <b>weather,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|At 1800UTC on March22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} disturbed <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Indian Ocean, approximately 685km (425mi) {{southeast of}} Christmas Island. The system was embedded mostly in the monsoon trough, surrounded by favorable environmental conditions, which prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0030UTC on March24. Convection increased as vertical wind shear decreased, and the system developed a curved band pattern. Throughout the day, the storm showed signs of potential rapid intensification, due to its quick organization. The Bureau of Meteorology's Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (Perth TCWC) noted {{the system as a}} tropical low at 1000UTC on March24, and the JTWC issued its first warning two hours later. However, for reasons which remain unclear, the Bureau of Meteorology did not extensively monitor the system.|$|E

Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Early Allied {{objectives}} {{in the wake}} of the D-Day invasion of German-occupied France included the deep water port of Cherbourg and the area surrounding the town of Caen. Allied attacks to expand the bridgehead had rapidly defeated the initial German attempts to destroy the invasion force, but bad <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English Channel delayed the Allied build-up of supplies and reinforcements, while enabling the Germans to move troops and supplies with less interference from the Allied air forces. Cherbourg was not captured by the VII US Corps until 27 June, and the German defence of Caen lasted until 20 July, when the southern districts were taken by the British and Canadians in Operation Goodwood and Operation Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became {{interested}} in Africa from Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and from the photographs of George Rodger. She visited Kenya {{for the first time}} in 1956 and later Sudan, where she photographed Nuba tribes with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily. Even though her film project about modern slavery entitled Die Schwarze Fracht ("The Black Cargo") was never completed, Riefenstahl was able to sell the stills from the expedition to magazines in various parts of the world. While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a Nairobi hospital, she finished writing the script, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the Suez Canal crisis and bad <b>weather.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, the film project was called off. Even so, Riefenstahl was granted Sudanese citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.|$|E

Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed.

5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor <b>weather</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days.
