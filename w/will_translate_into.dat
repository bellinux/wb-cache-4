25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
25|$|While {{toxicokinetics}} {{describes the}} changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, biotransformation, distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity binding sites increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain tissues or organs. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> effects at higher levels of organization.|$|E
25|$|It is now common {{place for}} retail stores (mostly jewellery, {{silverware}} or award stores) {{to have a}} small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator {{and the ability to}} do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2005, Harvard University President Lawrence Summers sparked {{controversy}} when, at an NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce, he made comments {{suggesting the}} lower {{numbers of women}} in high-level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women. He noted the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) on tests of cognitive abilities, leading to proportionally {{more men than women}} at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions. In his discussion of this, Summers said that [...] "even small differences in the standard deviation [...] <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> very large differences in the available pool substantially out [...] ".|$|E

5000|$|The 14-bit {{words are}} chosen such that binary ones are always {{separated}} by {{a minimum of two}} and a maximum of ten binary zeroes. This is because bits are encoded with NRZI encoding, or modulo-2 integration, so that a binary one is stored on the disc as a change from a land to a pit or a pit to a land, while a binary zero is indicated by no change. A sequence 0011 would be changed into 1101 or its inverse 0010 depending on the previous pit written. If there are two zeroes between two consecutive ones, then the written sequence will have three consecutive zeros (or ones), for example, 010010 <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> <b>into</b> 100011 (or 011100).
