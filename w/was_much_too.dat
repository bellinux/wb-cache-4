5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so that Type Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander}} at the Cape of Good Hope, Albemarle Bertie, {{had also}} been planning an operation in the Indian Ocean during 1809 and assembled a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley with orders to blockade the French islands, probe their defences and capture them if practical. Rowley found that his small squadron was unable to engage the French frigates and that the nearest British military base, Madras in British India, <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> far to be practical for staging amphibious operations. To remedy the latter problem, Rowley seized the small French island of Rodriguez with a force of British and Indian soldiers and garrisoned it as a supply base for his ships and as a military reserve to use in landings on the French islands. The first such operation was the Raid on Saint Paul in September 1809, in which the town of Saint Paul was captured, Caroline and her prizes seized and Île Bourbon's commander Nicolas Des Bruslys driven to suicide.|$|E

5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiment}} of Frederick Thomas Trouton (1902). A condenser {{was brought}} parallel to Earth's motion, {{and it was}} assumed that momentum is produced when the condenser is charged. The negative result can be explained by Lorentz's theory, according to which the electromagnetic momentum compensates the momentum due to Earth's motion. Lorentz could also show, that the sensitivity of the apparatus <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> low to observe such an effect.|$|E

Also, the school could no longer keep its chickens, pigs or bee hives. While the school was evacuated at Trench Hall, the buildings and grounds of Bunce Court were used by the military and were much changed and required restoration work before the school could return. Not until after the war was over, was the school finally {{able to return to}} Bunce Court in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Samuel C. Williams {{believed}} that Gist fathered Sequoyah around 1775 {{by his mother}} Wurteh Watts. She {{was the daughter of}} John Watts and Wurteh Giyosikoyohe, and sister of Doublehead. Of a prominent clan, she was also related to Old Tassel. Williams dismissed the story that Sequoyah's father was an itinerant German peddler by the name of Guess. He noted that Sequoyah went by George Guess, Guest, and Gist, and that he finished the Cherokee alphabet in 1821 when he was about 40. This <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> young for a man born in 1761. Williams noted that a letter showed that in 1828, Sequoyah visited Gist relatives in Kentucky and was acknowledged as a family member.|$|E

25|$|In 1777, the British sent Burgoyne's {{invasion}} {{force from}} Canada south to New York to seal off New England. Their {{aim was to}} neutralize the Yankees, whom the British perceived as {{the primary source of}} agitators. The British army in New York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination, capturing it from Washington. The invasion army under Burgoyne <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> slow and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops at Fort Mifflin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at Valley Forge.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1878, the {{official}} formation of Northants CCC {{took place at}} a meeting in the George Hotel, Kettering based on an existing organisation that dated back to 1820. The 1820 date, if it could be verified, would make Northants the oldest club in the present-day County Championship. The club came to prominence in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1890s as, between 1900 and 1904, the bowling of George Thompson and William East <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> good for almost all batsmen at that level. The county applied for first-class status in 1904 and was promoted the following year when it joined the County Championship. They played its inaugural first-class match versus Hampshire CCC at Southampton on 18, 19 & 20 May 1905 when making its County Championship debut.|$|E
25|$|The main Allied fleet under Admiral Torrington was {{stationed}} in the English Channel; {{a substantial part of}} the fleet was in the Mediterranean under Vice Admiral Henry Killigrew, which the Earl of Nottingham, William's Secretary of State and chosen naval advisor, hoped would neutralize the French Toulon squadron. Sir Cloudesley Shovell remained in the Irish Sea but his squadron <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> small to stop the French controlling these waters if they chose to do so. The French decided not to use their fleet as a subsidiary to the Irish campaign; King Louis XIV instead directed his navy against Torrington in the Channel. Although 6,000 French troops under the command of the Comte de Lauzun were ferried across to Ireland to aid James on 17 March, the French fleet under the Comte de Tourville returned to Brest on 1 May and there remained inactive during May and June, whilst the grand fleet was assembling.|$|E

25|$|Halbertsma {{was also}} the author of an 1836 {{biography}} of the Frisian poet Jan Cornelis Pieters Salverda (1783–1836), which almost has a naturalistic feel to it. In 1843 he published a historical work about the Mennonites, called De Doopsgezinden en Hunne Herkomst ("The Mennonites and Their Origins"), and in 1851 he followed this up with Aanteekeningen op het Vierde Deel van den Spiegel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant ("Notes on Part Four of the Spiegel Historiael by Jacob van Maerlant). Furthermore, in 1858, at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, whom he had met in London, Halbertsma published It Ewangeelje fen Matthewes, which was the first Frisian translation of the Biblical Gospel of Matthew (or of any gospel for that matter). This translation evoked a great deal of criticism from Halbertsma's contemporaries, who thought it <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> realistic; today, it still has an almost modern feel to it, showing that Halbertsma was far ahead of his time.|$|E
25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought she <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself everything she could about the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, she talked to anyone she happened to find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{depictions of}} smoking {{can be found}} on Classical Mayan pottery from around the 9th century. The art was primarily religious in nature and depicted deities or rulers smoking early forms of cigarettes. Soon after smoking was introduced outside of the Americas it began appearing in painting in Europe and Asia. The painters of the Dutch Golden Age {{were among the first to}} paint portraits of people smoking and still lifes of pipes and tobacco. For southern European painters of the 17th century, a pipe <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>too</b> modern to include in the preferred motifs inspired by mythology from Greek and Roman antiquity. At first smoking was considered lowly and was associated with peasants. Many early paintings were of scenes set in taverns or brothels. Later, as the Dutch Republic rose to considerable power and wealth, smoking became more common amongst the affluent and portraits of elegant gentlemen tastefully raising a pipe appeared. Smoking represented pleasure, transience and the briefness of earthly life as it, quite literally, went up in smoke. Smoking was also associated with representations of both the sense of smell and that of taste.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of April 1806, Strachan was the only British admiral still hunting for Willaumez's squadron, following the withdrawal of Duckworth and Warren.
