25|$|At 1640 hrs Teti put to sea a third time. She {{found another}} {{survivor}} in the water, threw him a lifebelt and towed him to sheltered water behind the mole, where the tug Aleghro under Captain Fanciulli recovered {{him from the}} water and took him ashore. Teti then <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> to sea and recovered two corpses from the water.|$|E
25|$|Wilma {{crossed the}} state in about 4.6hours and {{weakened}} to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 110mph (175km/h), after entering the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida. Key West received several feet {{of water in the}} low-lying areas and flooded homes. The Lower Keys also experienced an unusual flood: it occurred twice. First, as the storm approached Florida, it pushed water across the keys from south to north. As the storm finally crossed into the Everglades, all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as Wilma crossed the peninsula. The water then raced back across the Lower Keys a second time and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> to sea. This caused additional flooding and costly damage. Possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125mph (200km/h) and subsequently absorbed Tropical Storm Alpha to the south, before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On October 26, Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and on the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
500|$|Duquesne {{found itself}} in {{overtime}} once again as they dropped another game against the St. Louis Billikens in double overtime, 75–79. Melquan Bolding suffered another setback as he sat {{out most of the}} game, playing only five minutes due to strep throat. The team then <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> on the road to face the Rhode Island Rams, where they again lost with a final score of 67–75, dropping their conference record to 0–4. Bill Clark missed a game {{for the first time in}} his college career due to a suspension on suspicion of a [...] "secondary NCAA rules violation." [...] Melquan Bolding started the game for the first time since his injury, but only scored 6 points.|$|E

500|$|Nico Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:23.078 on his first timed run, a time that stood {{until the end of}} the session. Hamilton was second, 0.126 seconds off, followed by Sebastian Vettel just two-hundredths of a second behind him. In fourth place, Max Verstappen was faster than teammate Ricciardo for the first time, who finished fifth, ahead of Räikkönen. Upon beginning his preparation laps for qualifying, Rosberg had to come back into the garage, as a sensor on his car was malfunctioning. The team was capable of repairing the damage and he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> for the final minutes of practice. Sergio Pérez was satisfied with the eighth fastest time, saying that the car had improved [...] "everywhere" [...] following the updates it had received.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Haley's drinking problems, it had also become {{obvious that he}} was having serious mental problems as well; Martha Maria said that, [...] "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." [...] After he'd been jailed by the Harlingen Police, Martha had the judge put Haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said Bill's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, [...] "This is pointless." [...] She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> to his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his death on February 9, 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Located to {{the north}} of Old Portsmouth, the area where the ground is located was a sea inlet in the 17th century, across which was a dam. [...] The dam allowed the sea into the inlet when the tide came in, and when the tide <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> the dam was closed and the water was only allowed to escape under a watermill, named King's Mill, which powered the {{production}} of grain in the mill. After this, the land was gradually reclaimed from the sea. There is evidence that cricket has been played at the United Services Recreation Ground since 1852. [...] The ground in its present location {{is said to have been}} made available following largescale demolition of defence works in the city during the 1870s. First-class cricket was first played there on 17, 18 and 19 August 1882, when the touring Australians played Cambridge University Past and Present. This first match was won by Cambridge University Past and Present by 20 runs, following an Australian batting collapse in which A. G. Steel took 5/24. Hampshire first played there a week after the first match, against Sussex in which they lost by an innings. [...] Over the coming decade the ground was used once by G.N. Wyatt's XI, on three occasions by Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present and twice by the East of England. Hampshire lost first-class status during this period and were considered a second-class county, though Hampshire did play at the ground once during this period against Sussex in 1888. The 1893 match between the Australians and Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present was notable for the Australians setting what was then a record first-class innings score of 843. The amateur level Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club also played at the ground during the late 1890s, before the club was dissolved in 1898 because of an 1898 FA Amateur Cup tie in which The Football Association expelled Royal Artillery Portsmouth from the competition for alleged 'professionalism'. Out of the ashes of Royal Artillery, the present day Portsmouth F.C. was born.|$|E

60|$|He {{just saw}} through it {{the hand of}} the priest holding on high the ivory crucifix; but stopped not to see more, for he heard such words, such sounds, as drove him back to his former place. There he stayed, until the noise of {{something}} falling heavily within the cottage struck on his ear. Again he advanced toward the door; heard Father Paul praying; listened for several minutes; then heard a moaning voice, now joining itself to the voice of the priest, now choked in sobs and bitter wailing. Once more he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of hearing, and stirred not again from his place. He waited a long and a weary time there--so long that one of the scouts on the lookout came toward him, evidently suspicious of the delay in the priest's return. He waved the man back, and then looked again toward the door. At last he saw it open--saw Father Paul approach him, leading Francois Sarzeau by the hand.|$|E
