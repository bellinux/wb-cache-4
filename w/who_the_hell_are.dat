In 1990, Bart quickly {{became one of}} the most popular characters on television in what was termed [...] "Bartmania". He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as [...] "I'm Bart Simpson. <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> you?" [...] and [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.

2500|$|The Band {{gained a}} {{nickname}} while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss {{as he passed}} the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer.

However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: [...] "Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we?

Mine’s under the fire extinguisher now. That sure is a useful gadget. Sure we wear those leather jackets all the time, (A- 2 ’s they’re called), but only while we’re flying, we’re not supposed to wear them off the post, so the regulations say. I think I’m going to run overtime in flying. I’ve got 2 : 45 to go and I need 2 hours of formation, 2 : 40 nite x-country, a night altitude Day X-C, and 3 hours of instruments, so I’ll be pretty busy probably. My next dual instrument ride ought to be my check. Gosh what 45 minutes can mean in a lifetime.

That’s swell that Hilda’s bringing down a movie camera. Tell her to get some color film, and that I’ll pay her for it. Kodachrome is easier to get then black + white. Tell her to bring some black + white along though, it might be cloudy and Kodachrome isn’t good on dull days. Well my darling I’ve got to get to work, wish I could write more. Honey all I do is think of you all day, it’s pitiful, only ten more days though. They’ll be the longest of my life. Remember when we were talking about “only ten more weeks” though.
