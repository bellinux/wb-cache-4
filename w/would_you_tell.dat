500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
2500|$|During the battle, Langiewicz {{lost control}} over his troops who {{initially}} panicked. It was Rochebrune, who {{with the help of}} his Zouaves, managed to restore discipline and lead a successful attack on Russian positions. [...] He did so by personally grabbing panicked soldiers, throwing them back into the line, pointing his gun at them and cursing in broken Polish ("Psiakehv! Ktoha godzina?" [...] – [...] "Goddammit! <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me the time?" [...] – which according to contemporary sources was the only Polish he knew). As a consequence after the battle, Rochebrune was promoted to the rank of general and considered for the role of the overall leader of the uprising (ultimately rejected for political reasons).|$|E

5000|$|A simpler {{solution}} is to ask either man if they themselves <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that their path leads to freedom. For example, in the case where the knight's door in fact leads to freedom, the knight would answer [...] "yes" [...] (as he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that his own path led to freedom) and the knave [...] "no" [...] (although he <b>would</b> also <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that his own path led to freedom, he would lie about whether he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this).|$|R
6000|$|After a while, [...] "I wish <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me," [...] she said, [...] "just {{what you}} mean. I wish <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me {{what is the}} difference." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alice thought, {{but nothing}} came of it. 'Please, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me what YOU call yourself?' she said timidly. 'I think that might help a little.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will try," [...] said Bessie. [...] "And please, Papa, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> Nurse about it? She doesn't half believe us, {{and she is}} so {{tiresome}} about Miss Fosbrook!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens! {{what do you}} mean! <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> {{the girl}} what you're going to do? Why she'll tell your father, and Thady, and raise the whole country on me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It seems incredible--even impossible. I do {{not mean}} any harm by it, but <b>would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> me if <b>you</b> are any over eighteen?--that is to say, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me how old you are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|PRESS. [Cheerfully] Miss Stokes, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> kindly <b>tell</b> Lord William I'm {{here from}} the Press, {{and would like to}} speak to him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me,' said Alice, {{a little}} timidly, {{for she was}} not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why your cat grins like that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose this {{difference}} in rank, which you so cruelly insist on, did not exist, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me not to hope, not to speak then, as coldly as you tell me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do come in!" [...] she said. [...] "I want {{to thank}} you for the music. Nurse says it was for her, but I enjoyed it also. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me the words? I think it's a {{wonderful}} song." ...|$|E
6000|$|The marshal breathed easier. [...] "Stranger, you're {{a little}} the swiftest man I've met since harvest; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> me your name?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Lance started round angrily, and Cherry cried, 'O Felix, {{it is no}} such thing! Only <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> {{us where}} to find about the king and his priests that {{defeated}} the enemy by singing the [...] "mercy endureth for ever" [...] psalm?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful! I {{knew you}} must be a person of distinction, by your fine {{presence}} and courtly address, and by {{the fact that you are}} not subjected to the indignity of hobbles, like myself and the rest. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me your name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, travel; yes, I {{can travel}} well enough. But I {{wish you had}} some better sort of trap down in these country parts. I'm shaken to bits. And, doctor, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> your people to send that fellow of mine up here with hot water." ...|$|E
60|$|WISE MAN. Be silent all. [He {{has been}} {{standing}} silent, looking away.] Stand still in your places, {{for there is}} something I <b>would</b> have <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>you</b> promised <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me {{the rest}} another time.

6000|$|... 'I say, my dear, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> {{the butler}} {{to bring up}} some of the claret that was bought at Mr. Rollestone's auction. I told Sir Nicholas that he should taste it, and I don't like to mention it to poor Mervyn, as he must not drink wine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{some one}} else asked your advice? If some one else said, 'Here is my teacher, a jaded married {{man on the}} verge of middle age, and he and I have a violent passion for one another.

60|$|Everything was {{happening}} so oddly that she didn't {{feel a bit}} surprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one on each side: {{she would have liked}} very much to ask them how they came there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. 'Please, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me--' she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That--and other things. I don't {{know how}} the machine was nobbled, but {{it could not be}} done cheap. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> me your dreams again?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But you said, Lizzie,' {{observed}} Bella, {{returning to}} her subject when she had administered this chastisement, 'that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> lose, besides. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> me what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> lose, Lizzie?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None other, Godfrey. Have you {{not just}} now, {{at this very}} moment, told me that I was too proud? Can it be {{possible}} that you should wish to tie yourself for life to female pride? And {{if you tell me}} that now, at such a moment as this, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me in the close intimacy of married life, when the trifles of every day would have worn away the courtesies of guest and lover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little more}} patience," [...] she rejoined; [...] "and you shall soon hear. If I had only myself to think of, I should {{not feel the}} anxieties that now trouble me. I could take a housekeeper's place to-morrow. Yes! I was brought up among {{surroundings}} of luxury and refinement; I descended in rank when I married--but for all that, I could fill a domestic employment without repining my lot, without losing my self-respect. Adversity is a hard teacher of sound lessons, David. May I call you David? And if you heard of a housekeeper's place vacant, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Camperdown's voice, {{as he put}} to {{her this}} vital question, was severe, and almost {{justified}} the little burst of sobs which came forth {{as a prelude to}} Lizzie's answer. [...] "I did not know what I was doing. I don't know what you expect from me. You had been persecuting me ever since Sir Florian's death about the diamonds, and I didn't know what I was to do. They were my own, and I thought I was not obliged to tell everybody where I kept them. There are things which nobody tells. If I were to ask you all your secrets, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> them? When Sir Walter Scott was asked whether he wrote the novels, he didn't tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very probably," [...] {{answered}} Morris, [...] "but <b>would</b> <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> me {{also what}} are the exact circumstances which would in your opinion so aggravate this particular case?" ...|$|R
40|$|Our supreme lady, Memsahib Freda, {{was what}} you could call a goodnatured, kind-hearted soul, that is, if you chose to believe the stories that all who {{remember}} her <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> They <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> many things. They <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> for instance, that when Memsahib smiled, as she so often did, you could hardly see the eyes for the wrinkles. So purely, like a baby, would she smile that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> nervously glance behind you {{to make sure that}} it was really at you that the smile was directed. Her face, they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>would</b> just crumble into a million lines that rushed in to seize her little face from all directions, making it look like the hide of some little animal, that somebody had folded and put aside to be thrown away sometime...|$|R
6000|$|... "You terrify me, Stephen," [...] said Sybil {{rising from}} her seat. [...] "What {{can happen to}} him? What would he do, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> resist? <b>Tell</b> me--tell me, dear friend." ...|$|R
