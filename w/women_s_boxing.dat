Participants: A retrospective {{study was conducted}} on all female boxing competitions in Italy from April 2001 to December 2007. Sixty-one amateur female boxers were evaluated longitudinally. Interventions: Retrospective study: all pre-/post-match medical reports were analyzed. Prospective study: Breast, gynaecologic, brain, eyes, ear, nose and throat examinations were carried out. Main Outcome Measurements: Retrospective study: any injury assessed before/after the match. Prospective study: health problems which {{could be related to}} boxing activity. Results: Retrospective study: data from 5600 examinations were collected. Pre-competition, a medical problem was recorded in 3 athletes (1 conjunctiva hyperemia, 1 zygomatic bruise, 1 eyelid hematoma). Post-competition, 51 / 2800 medical checks showed mild common injuries, such as, soft tissue facial lesions, epistaxis, and hand-wrist problems. Only one concussion was recorded with hospitalization (for a thorough evaluation). Another athlete was hospitalized for a nasal fracture. Prospective study: 2 fibroadenomas, 3 ovarian cysts, and 1 intramural uterine myoma were diagnosed. In 4 boxers non-specific electroencephalographic abnormalities were detected however with a normal brain MRI in 3 (the 4 th is still waiting for the radiologic procedure).

As time went by, it developed into a pilot undertaking for promoting improved strains of sorghum and millet, with support from the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics. The women tested the new varieties, and set themselves up to change their own methods of production. They have much to be proud of now: they have demonstrated that the cereals are perfectly well-suited to the dry climate in the region, more so than maize, which is the dominant crop but is too demanding in water. The women also developed simple and effective ways of grinding the grains. Finally they showed that, with appropriate recipes and cooking methods, sorghum and millet could profitably replace maize in local diets. Now that the group is growing and marketing the improved strains in the Makindu region, other local people are turning to these crops, which are better suited to the local climate.

Encryption algorithm {{plays a major}} role in network application and data security systems. But securing data consumes a major amount of resources such as CPU time and battery power. We also focus on improvising the performance and security provided by the blowfish encryption algorithm. With advancement in technology, DES is found to be no longer secure. As a drop-in replacement for DES, blowfish encryption algorithm can be used. The blowfish algorithm which was originally 64 -bit block cipher is transformed into 128 -bit block cipher. This paper also proposes various modifications in the blowfish algorithm such as a new logic has been incorporated instead of just replicating the bits in the key expansion part. In Blowfish algorithm there are four <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> each with 256 entries which consume a memory space. Hence this paper proposes an alternative to replace these <b>boxes</b> with AES <b>S</b> <b>box</b> and mix column techniques. This also reduces the memory consumption as <b>S</b> <b>box</b> is dynamically generated and only multiplicative inverse box is stored.

The <b>S</b> <b>box</b> RNA is the most wide spread transcriptional riboswitch in Gram -positive bacteria, while the SMK RNA is a translational riboswitch in members of the Lactobacillales.

Our lab employs both X-ray crystallography and chemical probing to analyze their ligand recognition and mechanisms of gene repression. Our X-ray structures show that both the SMK and <b>S</b> <b>box</b> riboswitches fold into compact structures once bound to SAM, and that both RNAs adopt unique yet elegantly simple ways to specifically recognize SAM in favor of its close homolog, SAdenosyl-homocysteine (SAH).

With the increasing use of digital techniques for transmitting and storing Multimedia data, the fundamental issue of protecting the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the information poses a major challenge for security professionals and hassled to the major developments in Cryptography. In cryptography, an S-Box (Substitution-box) is a basic componentof symmetric key algorithms, which performs substitution and is typically used to make the relationship between the key and the cipher text non linear and most of the symmetric key algorithms like DES, Blowfish makes use of <b>S</b> <b>boxes.</b> This paper proposes a new method for design of <b>S</b> <b>boxes</b> based on chaos theory. Chaotic equations are popularly known for its randomness, extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and ergodicity. The modified design has been tested with blowfish algorithm which has no effective crypt analysis reported against its design till date because of its salient design features including the key dependant <b>s</b> <b>boxes</b> and complex key generation process. However every new key requires pre-processing equivalent to encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers and it prevents its usage in memory limited applications and embedded systems.

Overproduction of SAM synthetase in Bacillus subtilis resulted in delay in induction of <b>S</b> <b>box</b> gene expression in response to methionine starvation, consistent with the hypothesis that SAM is the molecular effector in vivo.
