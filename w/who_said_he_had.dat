Washington decided to attack himself and brought 40 soldiers with him towards Tanacharison's camp. That morning, they met with Tanacharison's 12 Indian warriors, and Washington and Tanacharison agreed to attack the encampment. Washington ambushed the French, killing 10 to 12, wounding 2 and capturing 21. Among the dead was Jumonville; the exact manner of his death is uncertain, but by several accounts Tanacharison executed Jumonville in cold blood, crushing his head with a tomahawk and washing his hands in Jumonville's brains. One account, reported by an Indian to Contrecœur, claimed that Jumonville was killed by Half King while the summons was being read.|$|E

Burdon, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: [...] "I made false statements... I simply didn't understand what the situation was. I misread the note... I {{thought it was a}} goodbye". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: [...] "I want you to keep this [...] forever [...] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me".|$|E

500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times {{asked a question}} about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," [...] and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued.

500|$|Boulding scored Grimsby's {{first goal}} of the 2003–04 season, during the opening day 2–2 draw with Plymouth Argyle. He {{continued}} {{to be in the}} goals {{at the start of the}} season and added another five by mid-September, scored in successive games during October to guide Grimsby to back-to-back victories, and had scored 13goals by the end of 2003. However, manager Paul Groves was sacked in January 2004 following a run of poor results which culminated in a 6–0 defeat to Oldham Athletic, leaving Grimsby one point off the relegation places. Boulding, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously stayed because of Groves, himself immediately left the club, moving to Barnsley in February 2004 for a fee of £50,000, having scored a total of 17goals from 42games during his second spell with Grimsby. He later said the decision to leave was the worst of his career and that he had had his happiest times at Grimsby, saying [...] "Grimsby is the club I have been happiest at.

500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from an old man <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice {{so close to the}} microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
500|$|Strauss {{made his}} Test cricket debut {{at the age}} of 27 after being called into the team to replace the injured Michael Vaughan. He scored a century in the first innings of the match, played against New Zealand at Lord's, his county home ground for Middlesex. In the second innings of the match he missed out on {{becoming}} the first England batsman to score centuries in both innings of his Test debut when he was run out on 83. His second Test century came in the first match of the series against the West Indies two months later, and was also scored at Lord's. The following English winter, Strauss scored three centuries during the Test series in South Africa, earning him the man of the series accolade, and high praise from Allan Donald, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "never seen any visiting player bat as well, with so many match-winning performances". In 2008, he passed 150 {{for the first time in}} Test cricket, scoring 177 against New Zealand at McLean Park, Napier. The innings, his highest in Test cricket, is also the only time he has scored a Test century when not playing as an opening batsman for England. Strauss was named as England captain in 2009, and responded by passing 140 four times during the year, hitting centuries in three subsequent Tests against the West Indies, and scoring his highest total during an Ashes series against Australia, reaching 161 at Lord's. After a series of low scores, Strauss scored a century against the West Indies in the first match of the 2012 series, his first in a year and a half.|$|E
500|$|The voice cast {{was signed}} on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The {{producers}} were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect}} on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them. They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film. The [...] "strongest possible" [...] writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen. David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script. Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien expressed interest in working with the Simpsons staff again, although he later joked that [...] "I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, so maybe it's all for the best." [...] The same went for director Brad Bird <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "entertained fantasies of asking if [...] could work on the movie", but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille. The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory.|$|E
