25|$|In Livy's account, the new Bacchic mysteries were {{originally}} restricted {{to women and}} held only three times a year; but were corrupted by the Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken men and <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and morality; a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.|$|E

Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between Democrat and Republican. Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E

The Fancy sailed north to the Arabian Sea, where a 25-ship convoy of Grand Mughal vessels was making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, including the treasure-laden Ghanjah dhow Ganj-i-sawai and its escort, the Fateh Muhammed. Joining forces with several pirate vessels, Avery found himself in command of a small pirate squadron. As the pirates gave chase, the smaller vessels in the squadron gradually fell behind, {{and at some point}} Tew was killed in an engagement with a Mughal ship. Avery had more success capturing the Fateh Muhammed and later overtaking the Ganj-i-sawai, snapping its mainmast in a cannonball volley. Following several hours of ferocious hand-to-hand combat on deck, the pirates emerged victorious. Although many pirates were killed, Avery captured up to £600,000 in precious metals and jewels, equivalent to around £52m in 2010 prices, making him the richest pirate in the world. Avery and his crew tortured and killed a great number of the passengers and raped <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>ages.</b> Some women stabbed themselves with daggers or jumped overboard, committing suicide to escape this fate.|$|E
