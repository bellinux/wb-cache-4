5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out,</b> the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. Whether it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of solution in {{the bulk of the}} solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and semi-solids. Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas.|$|E
25|$|Alarm {{response}} behavior varies {{according to}} the type of predator announced. If the alarm indicates a hawk diving toward the colony, all the prairie dogs in its flight path dive into their holes, while those outside the flight path stand and watch. If the alarm is for a human, all members of the colony immediately rush inside the burrows. For coyotes, the prairie dogs move to the entrance of a burrow and stand outside the entrance, observing the coyote, while those prairie dogs that were inside the burrows <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to stand and watch as well. For domestic dogs, the response is to observe, standing in place where they were when the alarm was sounded, again with the underground prairie dogs emerging to watch.|$|E

25|$|In June 2016, it was {{announced}} that Mel Gibson is working on a sequel to The Passion of the Christ, focusing on the resurrection of Jesus. The screenwriter is Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay for Braveheart (1995). Gibson has expressed an interest in directing the film. He also said that the film <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> in a few years since it is a big project. In November 2016, Gibson confirmed that the title of the sequel would be Resurrection and implied that part of the movie would be taking place in hell, stating that the film would explore what happened in the three-day period between the death of Jesus and his return. He also revealed that the film would probably be about three years away, because of its massive undertaking. Mel also said Its a vast theological experience, need to dwell into.|$|E

Another theory presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules which resists the effect of surface tension.|$|E

The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted [...] "Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|The great spotted kiwi is nocturnal in behaviour. If the kiwis {{live in an}} area lacking predators, they <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> in the day. At night, {{they come}} out to feed.

One pair's territory can be [...] in size. It is not known how they defend such a large territory in proportion to their size. They will call, chase, or fight intruders out. Vocalisations of the great spotted kiwi include growls, hisses, and bill snapping. Great spotted kiwi males have a call that resembles a warbling whistle, while the female call is harsh raspy, and also warbling.|$|E

Cindy White criticized the writers for waiting for Ferrell's second-to last episode to give his character a [...] "juicy quirk". Soon after the episode's airdate, the series received publicity for a possible storyline featuring Phyllis as Erin's birth mother. The rumor was started during an interview with executive producer Greg Daniels with Entertainment Weekly in which he stated [...] "A tiny mystery story – which I'm not sure anyone’s going to catch and <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> a few episodes from now – is being set up here".

Smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence—his visit to the UK in 2004 to meet Conservative politicians was largely ignored by the British press—but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among Zimbabwean opposition supporters, who came to see him as an unbreakable, defiant symbol of resistance to the Mugabe government. According to RW Johnson, a speech he gave to students at the University of Zimbabwe condemning Mugabe and ZANU–PF as incompetent and corrupt [...] "gangsters" [...] earned him a standing ovation. In 2002, Smith challenged Mugabe to come with him to a township to see who got the best welcome.

500|$|In June 2007, {{prior to}} production, a German Defence Ministry {{spokesperson}} said that filming of Valkyrie {{would not be}} allowed at the country's military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise, due to the actor's adherence to Scientology, which is regarded as a dangerous cult by the German authorities. The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyries producers. Colonel Stauffenberg's eldest child, retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, also voiced concerns over Cruise's portrayal of his father, saying that he would not oppose the film's production, but hoped that Cruise would drop the role. [...] "I fear that only terrible kitsch <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the project. It's bound to be rubbish," [...] he said. [...] "Cruise should keep his hands off my father."
