40|$|Legal context The {{recognition}} {{and protection of}} <b>well-known</b> <b>marks</b> in Indonesia has improved {{over the last few}} years for a variety of reasons. Key points First, the Asian Crisis resulted in the creation of a Commercial Court, which is a clear improvement over the previously responsible District Courts. Secondly, the increasingly frequent publication of court decisions has improved transparency and consistency of those decisions. <b>Well-known</b> <b>marks</b> are now clearly protected against use for similar goods/services. Protection is extended to dissimilar goods/services by applying Article 16 (3) TRIPS directly or by arguing that registration occurred in bad faith. Nevertheless, decisions thus far concern almost exclusively revocation and invalidity of registrations. Civil remedies such as damages and interim injunctions are hardly used, because the outdated civil procedural law has not familiarised judges with such legal instruments. Clearing the register of infringing registrations is another matter of concern. Cancellation for non-use for three consecutive years can be difficult, because the plaintiff is required to provide evidence of the last use in the production of the goods/services rather than in the course of trade more generally. Practical significance While it has become much easier to protect <b>well-known</b> <b>marks</b> in Indonesia, much work remains to be done regarding the procedural framework of civil infringement proceedings and regarding the clearing of the register. <br /...|$|R

These revisions aim {{to solve the problem}} that emerged in 2004 of more and more businesses excessively and sometimes illegally seeking <b>well-known</b> <b>mark</b> recognition and using the label “Chinese well-known mark” in advertisements. How this problem originated and developed, and how and whether the current legislation and practice have solved it need thorough exploration. Previous research has not combined analysis of the application of laws in practice with analysis of the institutional foundation and legal system of <b>well-known</b> <b>mark</b> protection. It has lacked a theoretical framework to illustrate the nature of the problem associated with well-known marks. By using the perspective of semiotic analysis, in particular the mythology of Roland Barthes, this thesis illustrates the nature of the problem of well-known marks and contends that the crux {{of the problem is that}} the “Chinese well-known mark” label has become a harmful Barthesian myth which has distorted the informative function of the trademark, deceived consumers and harmed firms’ brand building in the long run. The myth emerged because of China’s specific historical background and has to some extent been debunked following the change in the institutional and legal environment in the country. There are five main actors in the process of its formation: firms as its producers; trademark agencies as the promoters and helpers of the firms; local government policies that provide incentives for the firms to engage in producing the myth; consumers as the myth readers; and the authorities in charge, including the TMO, the TRAB and the people’s courts, which have failed in the role of mythologists to decipher the myth. In order to further debunk the myth, the problems in judicial practice of the people’s courts should be tackled. Provisions that relate to the good-faith competition principle should be developed and effectively enforced to regulate the excessive recognition of well-known marks and fraudulent litigation. Article 9 (2) of Interpretation on <b>Well-known</b> <b>Mark</b> (2009) infused the dilution doctrine into <b>well-known</b> <b>mark</b> protection. However, it has an inherent contradiction and is not suitable for the current Chinese legal context. This has done little to help the court debunk and decipher the myth. This thesis suggests dilution doctrine should be cautiously applied, and explores alternative approaches for strengthening the protection of well-known marks. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

A legal claim that a defendant is unjustly benefiting by using a plaintiff’s mark is hollow unless it is accompanied by a theory of why that benefit should rightly belong to the plaintiff.

40|$|Altered {{metabolism}} is {{a hallmark}} of almost all cancers. A tumor’s metabolic phenotype can drastically change its ability to proliferate and to survive stressors such as hypoxia or therapy. Metabolism {{can be used as}} a diagnostic marker, by differentiating neoplastic and normal tissue, and as a prognostic marker, by providing information about tumor metastatic potential. Metabolism can further be used to guide treatment selection and monitoring, as cancer treatments can influence metabolism directly by targeting a specific metabolic dysfunction or indirectly by altering upstream signaling pathways. Repeated measurement of metabolic changes during the course of treatment can therefore indicate a tumor’s response or resistance. Recently, well-supported theories indicate that the ability to modulate metabolic phenotype underpins some cancer cells’ ability to remain dormant for decades and recur with an aggressive phenotype. It follows that accurate identification and repeated monitoring of a tumor’s metabolic phenotype can bolster understanding and prediction of a tumor’s behavior from diagnosis, through treatment, and (sadly) sometimes back again. The two primary axes of metabolism are glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and alteration of either can promote unwanted outcomes in cancer. In particular, increased glucose uptake independent of oxygenation is a <b>well-known</b> <b>mark</b> of aggressive cancers that are more likely to metastasize and evade certain therapies. Lately, mitochondria are also gaining recognition as key contributors in tumor metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to promote metastasis in a variety of cell types. Most tumor types rely on a combination of both aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, but the two axes’ relative contributions to ATP production can vary wildly. Knowledge of both glycolytic and mitochondrial endpoints is required for actionable, systems-level understanding of tumor metabolic preference. Several technologies exist that can measure endpoints informing on glycolytic and/or mitochondrial metabolism. However, these technologies suffer from a combination of prohibitive cost, low resolution, and lack of repeatability due to destructive sample treatments. There is a critical need to bridge the gap in pre-clinical studies between single-endpoint whole body imaging and destructive ex vivo assays that provide multiple metabolic properties, neither of which can provide adequate spatiotemporal information for repeated tumor monitoring. Optical technologies are well-suited to non-destructive, high resolution imaging of tumor metabolism. A carefully chosen set of endpoints can be measured across a variety of length scales and resolutions to obtain a complete picture of a tumor’s metabolic state. First, the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) can be used to report on glucose uptake. The fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) reports on mitochondrial membrane potential, which provides information regarding capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Vascular oxygenation (SO 2) and morphological features, which are critical for interpretation of 2 -NBDG and TMRE uptake, can be obtained using only endogenous contrast from hemoglobin. Three specific aims were proposed toward the ultimate goal of developing an optical imaging toolbox that utilizes exogenous fluorescence and endogenous absorption contrast to characterize cancer metabolic phenotype in vivo. In Aim 1, we optimized the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -(N-(7 -Nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) Amino) - 2 -Deoxyglucose (2 -NBDG) to report on glycolytic demand in vivo. Our primary goal was to demonstrate that correcting 2 -NBDG uptake (NBDG 60) by the rate of delivery (RD) showed improved contrast between distinct tumor phenotypes. We showed that the ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD served as a delivery-corrected measure of glucose uptake in the dorsal skin flap window chamber models containing normal tissues and tumors. Delivery correction was able to minimize the effects of a large change in the injected 2 -NBDG dose. Further, the endpoint showed a significant inverse correlation with blood glucose levels. Since glucose has been shown to competitively inhibit 2 -NBDG transport into cells, this finding indicating that we were indeed reporting on glucose uptake. Importantly, the ratio was able to distinguish specific uptake of 2 -NBDG from accumulation of a fluorescent control, 2 -NBDLG, which is identical to 2 -NBDG in molecular weight and fluorescent spectrum, but is unable to undergo active transport into the cell. The ratio 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was then leveraged to compare different tumor phenotypes and to characterize the dependence of glucose uptake on vascular oxygenation within these tumors. Our results showed that 2 -NBDG 60 /RD was an effective endpoint for comparing in vivo glucose uptake of metastatic 4 T 1 and nonmetastatic 4 T 07 murine mammary adenocarcinomas. Further, the addition of vascular information revealed metabolic heterogeneity within the tumors. The primary conclusion of Aim 1 was that delivery-corrected 2 -NBDG uptake (2 -NBDG 60 /RD) is an appropriate indicator of glucose demand in both normal and tumor tissues. In Aim 2, we optimized fluorescent tetramethyl rhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) for measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). We then leveraged the relationships between MMP, glucose uptake, and vascular endpoints to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Using two-photon microscopy, we confirmed that TMRE localizes to mitochondrial-sized features in the window chamber when delivered via tail vein. The kinetics of TMRE uptake were robust across both normal and tumor tissues, with a stable temporal window for measurement from 40 - 75 minutes after injection. We saw that TMRE uptake decreased as expected in response to hypoxia in non-tumor tissue, and in response to chemical inhibition with a mitochondrial uncoupler in both non-tumor and 4 T 1 tissue. MMP was increased in all tumor types relative to non-tumor (p We leveraged the relationships between the now-optimized endpoints of MMP (Aim 2), glucose uptake (Aim 1) and vascular endpoints (Aims 1 and 2) to characterize the in vivo metabolic landscapes of three distinct and extensively studied murine breast cancer lines: metastatic 4 T 1 and non-metastatic 67 NR and 4 T 07. Imaging the combination of endpoints revealed a classic “Warburg effect” coupled with hyperpolarized mitochondria in 4 T 1; 4 T 1 maintained vastly increased glucose uptake and comparable MMP relative to 4 T 07 or 67 NR across all SO 2. We also showed that imaging trends were concordant with independent metabolomics analysis, though the lack of spatial and vascular data from metabolomics obscured a more detailed comparison of the technologies. We observed that vascular features in tumor peritumoral areas (PA) were equally or more aberrant than vessels in the tumor regions that they neighbored. This prompted consideration of the metabolic phenotype of the PA. Regional metabolic cooperation between the tumor region and the PA was seen only in 4 T 1, where MMP was greater in 4 T 1 tumors and glucose uptake was greater in 4 T 1 PAs. Because of their regional metabolic coupling as well as their demonstrated capacity for glycolysis and mitochondrial activity, we hypothesized that the 4 T 1 tumors would have an increased ability to maintain robust MMP during hypoxia. 67 NR and 4 T 07 tumors showed expected shifts toward decreased MMP and increased glucose uptake during hypoxia, similar to the trends we observed in normal tissue. Surprisingly, 4 T 1 tumors appeared to increase mitochondrial metabolism during hypoxia, since MMP increased and SO 2 dramatically decreased. Overall, this aim demonstrated two key findings: 1. TMRE is a suitable marker of mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo in normal tissue and tumors, and 2. imaging of multiple metabolic and vascular endpoints is crucial for the appropriate interpretation of a metabolic behavior. Finally, in Aim 3 we evaluated the feasibility of combined 2 -NBDG and TMRE imaging. The primary objective was to enable simultaneous imaging of the two fluorophores by minimizing sources of “cross-talk”: chemical reaction, optical overlap, and confounding biological effects. A secondary objective was to transition our imaging method to a new platform, a reflectance-mode, high-resolution fluorescence imaging system built in our lab, which would expand the use of our technique beyond the dorsal window chamber model. We first used liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry to confirm that the chemical properties of the two fluorophores were compatible for simultaneous use, and indeed saw that the mixing of equimolar 2 -NBDG and TMRE did not form any new chemical species. We also performed a phantom study on the hyperspectral imaging system, used for all animal imaging in Aim 1 and Aim 2, to estimate the range of 2 -NBDG and TMRE concentrations that are seen at the tissue level in normal and tumor window chambers. We created a new phantom set that spanned the range of estimated in vivo concentrations, and imaged them with the reflectance-mode fluorescence imaging system. The phantom experiments gave us two important findings. First, we saw that fluorescence intensity increased linearly with fluorophore concentration, allowing for accurate quantification of concentration changes between samples. Most importantly, we found that we could exploit the optical properties of the fluorophores and our system’s spectral detection capability to excite the two fluorophores independently. Specifically, we could excite 2 -NBDG with a 488 nm laser without detectable emission from TMRE, and could excite TMRE with a 555 nm laser without detectable emission from 2 -NBDG. With this characterization, the optical properties of the two fluorophores were considered compatible for simultaneous imaging. Next, we sought to determine whether biological or delivery interactions would affect uptake of the two fluorophores. Surprisingly, both in vitro and in vivo imaging suggested that simultaneous dosing of the 2 -NBDG and TMRE caused significant changes in uptake of both probes. Since we previously found that TMRE equilibrates rapidly at the tissue site, we hypothesized that staggering the injections to allow delivery of TMRE to tissue before injecting 2 -NBDG would restore the full uptake of both fluorophores. Two sequential injection protocols were used: in the first group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after only 1 - 5 minutes, and in the second group, TMRE was injected first followed by injection of 2 -NBDG after 10 - 15 minutes. Both sequential injection strategies were sufficient to restore the final fluorescence of both fluorophores to that seen in the separate TMRE or 2 -NBDG imaging cohorts; however, the shorter time delay caused changes to the initial delivery kinetics of 2 -NBDG. We concluded that sequential imaging of TMRE followed by 2 -NBDG with a 10 - 15 minute delay was therefore the optimal imaging strategy to enable simultaneous quantification of glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. Applying the sequential imaging protocol to 4 T 1 tumors demonstrated a highly glycolytic phenotype compared to the normal animals, as we had seen in Aim 2. However, mitochondrial membrane potential was comparable for the normal and tumor groups. The next study will test an extended delay between the injections to allow more time for TMRE delivery to tumors prior to 2 -NBDG injection. Overall, the key finding of Aim 3 was that a carefully chosen delivery strategy for 2 -NBDG and TMRE enabled simultaneous imaging of the two endpoints, since chemical and optical cross-talk were negligible. The work presented here indicates that an optical toolbox of 2 -NBDG, TMRE, and vascular endpoints is well poised to reveal interesting and distinct metabolic phenomena in normal tissue and tumors. Future work will focus on the integration of optical spectroscopy with the microscopy toolbox presented here, to enable long-term studies of the unknown metabolic changes underlying a tumor’s response to therapy, its escape into dormancy, and ultimately, its recurrence.

The neoplastic response of the lower respiratory tract mainly consisted of adenomas in the bronchiolo-alveolar region, although bronchial papillomas and a few peripheral carcinomas were also observed. The <b>well-known,</b> <b>marked</b> carcinogenic effect of DENA on the upper respiratory tract of the Syrian golden hamster was confirmed...|$|R

I took up the big magnifying-glass with which I had often scanned that {{photograph}} close before. Not a sign or a trace of them. I shut my eyes, and called up again the mental Picture of the murder. I looked hard at the phantom-hand in it, that floated like a vision, all distinct before my mind's eye. It was flat and smooth and white. Not a scar--not a sign on it. I turned round to Jane, that too natural detective.|$|R

It paves the way for faster development of science, technology, and culture and creates a stronger basis for the Chinese market economy. With the rapid development of China 2 ̆ 7 s economy, culminating in China 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the World Trade Organization (“WTO”), and the pressure put to bear from multinational corporations and the governments of developed countries, the Chinese government has become aware that protection of well-known trademarks pursuant to the standards of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the WTO (“TRIPS” or “TRIPS Agreement” or “Agreement”) must be an integral part of China 2 ̆ 7 s trademark laws. It was not until 1993, however, that the protection of well-known trademarks was integrated into a legal document, the Implementing Regulations of the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China Trademark Law (“Implementing Regulations”). The issue has gained importance with the expansion of China 2 ̆ 7 s international trade. This Article focuses on the People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China (“PRC”) Trademark Law and the provisions concerning the protection of <b>well-known</b> <b>marks.</b> The Article is divided into three parts: regulation of well-known trademarks in China prior to its WTO accession; the current protection granted to <b>well-known</b> <b>marks</b> as of the recent amendments to the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations; and the considerations involved when defining what constitutes a well-known trademark, presented in the international context...|$|R
