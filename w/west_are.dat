5|$|Denver's {{early years}} as a major train hub of the <b>west</b> <b>are</b> still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at {{historic}} Union Station, where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, {{at the completion of}} FasTracks.|$|E

50|$|It is {{situated}} on Upton Lane (A114). Nearby to the <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the Newham College of Further Education, and further <b>west</b> <b>is</b> {{the site of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics. Opposite the school is West Ham Park.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to the <b>west</b> <b>is</b> Osney Ditch.|$|R
5|$|Just {{beyond the}} station, to the <b>west,</b> <b>are</b> {{a pair of}} relief lines to allow slower trains to be overtaken. There are also some {{cross-over}} points, allowing trains to terminate on the westbound relief line and then return eastwards.|$|E
5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further <b>west</b> <b>are</b> the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|Luttwak terminates his {{analysis}} {{at the end}} of Constantine's reign, before the establishment of the diocesan comitatus. Unlike the imperial escort-armies, these were close enough to the theatre of operations to succour the border troops. But their stationing may have differed little from the location of legions in the 2nd century, even though they apparently wintered inside cities, rather than in purpose-built legionary bases. For example, the two comitatus of Illyricum (East and <b>West)</b> <b>are</b> documented as wintering in Sirmium, which was the site of a major legionary base in the Principate.|$|E
50|$|The Central <b>West's</b> east <b>is</b> higher, wetter and hillier and {{supports}} orchards, vineyards, vegetable-growing and pastoralism. The <b>west</b> <b>is</b> flatter and drier {{and supports}} grain crops and pastoralism.|$|R
50|$|Glenora is bounded on {{the east}} by Groat Road, on the north by 107 Avenue, on the west by 142 Street, and on the south by the river valley and the MacKinnon Ravine. Immediately across Groat Road and {{to the east and}} north east is the {{neighbourhood}} of Westmount. To the north is the neighbourhood of North Glenora. To the north <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the neighbourhood of McQueen. To the <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the neighbourhood of Grovenor (sometimes called West Glenora and Westgrove) and to the south <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the neighbourhood of Crestwood.|$|R

5|$|The Home Farm {{buildings}} {{were built in}} the 1880s, split over two levels. To the south is a two-storey covered yard with a timber roof structure, used for the rearing of farm animals. On the upper level is the main yard, where to the east and <b>west</b> <b>are</b> two wings, one side of which housed the former piggery. The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} and north west respectively, are the two large islands of Islay and Jura. South <b>west</b> <b>are</b> Rathlin Island and the north of Ireland, which {{can be seen from}} Gigha on clear days. Between Jura and Gigha are the rocks of Na Cuiltean and Skervuile Lighthouse. Between Gigha and Port Ellen on Islay is the Isle of Texa. Eilean Mòr, and the Isle of Danna are little further up the Argyll coast to the north.|$|E
5|$|At Steeles Avenue, {{the freeway}} enters the Regional Municipality of York. To the east are {{industrial}} units, {{while on the}} <b>west</b> <b>are</b> residential suburbs. This land-use persists north to the Highway407 ETR interchange, a multi-level stack interchange with two flyovers. North of Highway407, the freeway crosses Highway7, where the HOV lanes transition to standard through lanes. The freeway passes west of Buttonville Municipal Airport and then interchanges with 16thAvenue. It narrows and the central barrier ends; a grass median taking its place between the opposing lanes. The land-use density continues to drop, {{with the appearance of}} some open spaces and farms interspersed with industrial and commercial buildings. By 19thAvenue, just north of the Honda Canada headquarters in Markham, the land-use is agricultural on both sides of Highway404. Highway 404 continues north, forming the eastern boundary of the municipalities of Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket and the western boundary of Whitchurch-Stouffville. North of Wellington Street, the highway reduces in width to four lanes, which is its configuration north through East Gwillimbury. The route continues, passing east of the community of Sharon, eventually curving northeast and terminating at an at-grade intersection with Woodbine Avenue immediately south of Ravenshoe Road (York Regional Road32).|$|E

5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to the <b>west</b> <b>are</b> stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E
5|$|Within the interior, {{the upper}} and middle floors are State floors; they are in turn divided into several {{reception}} rooms, throne rooms and galleries complete with royal portraits of every Chakri Monarchs (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts. More specifically, to the east gallery are Buddhist Images and other religious images, while to the <b>west</b> <b>are</b> reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In {{other parts of the}} throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of Kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their Queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower floor or ground floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is a museum displaying old weapons.|$|E
5|$|One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was {{described}} as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele. These examinations, however, did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and <b>west</b> <b>are</b> the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light {{as to whether or not}} these ants are genetically different from the meat ant.|$|E
