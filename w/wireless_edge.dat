40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} optimal MDS-encoded cache placement at the <b>wireless</b> <b>edge</b> to minimize the backhaul rate in heterogeneous networks. We derive the backhaul rate performance of any caching scheme based on file splitting and MDS encoding and we formulate the optimal caching scheme as a convex optimization problem. We then thoroughly investigate the performance of this optimal scheme for an important heterogeneous network scenario. We compare it to several other caching strategies and we analyze {{the influence of the}} system parameters, such as the popularity and size of the library files and the capabilities of the small-cell base stations, on the overall performance of our optimal caching strategy. Our results show that the careful placement of MDS-encoded content in caches at the <b>wireless</b> <b>edge</b> leads to a significant decrease of the load of the network backhaul and hence to a considerable performance enhancement of the network.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the jitter on the <b>wireless</b> <b>edge</b> links between the RS and the managed SSs, the RS- 3 TCAC sends a QoS-REQ signalling message to its payload entity and then triggers the trusted absolute timestamping service. The 3 TCAE entity forwards the received packet to the SS which should answer with a first QoS-RSP message. 3 TCAE receives the QoS-RSP and then forwards it to the RS- 3 TCAC which computes the edge delay between the RS and the SS. As the jitter computation requires a synchronization between the entity which will send {{the equivalent of the}} RTP packets each 20 ms and the entity which will receive them, the RS- 3 TCAC and the SS need to have the same clock values.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Mobile data {{users are}} known to possess pre-dictable {{characteristics}} both in their interests and activity patterns. Yet, their service is predominantly performed, espe-cially at the <b>wireless</b> <b>edges,</b> “reactively ” {{at the time of}} request, typically when the network is under heavy traffic-load. This strategy incurs excessive costs to the service providers to sustain on-time (or delay-intolerant) delivery of data content, while their resources are left underutilized during the light-loaded hours. This motivates us in this work to study the problem of op-timal “proactive ” scheduling whereby, future delay-intolerant data demands can be served within a given prediction window ahead of their actual time-of-arrival to minimize service costs. To that end, we first establish fundamental bounds on the minimum possible cost achievable by any proactive policy, {{as a function of the}} prediction uncertainties. These bounds provide interesting insights on the impact of uncertainty on the maximum achievable proactive gains. We then propose specific proactive scheduling strategies, both for uniform and fluctuating demand patterns, that are asymptotically-optimal in the limit as the prediction window size grows while the prediction uncertainties remain fixed. We further establish the exponential convergence rate characteristics of our proposed solutions to the optimal, revealing close-to-optimal performance characteristics of our designs even with small prediction win-dows. Also, proactive design is contrasted with its reactive and delay-tolerant counter-parts to obtain interesting results on the unavoidable costs of uncertainty and the potentially remarkable gains of proactive operation.

We measure radio characteristics in these environments at different days and times and analyse the impact of variations in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of DFAR emotion and activity recognition.

40|$|Cache-aided coded {{multicast}} leverages {{side information}} at <b>wireless</b> <b>edge</b> caches to efficiently serve multiple groupcast demands via common multicast transmissions, leading to load reductions that are {{proportional to the}} aggregate cache size. However, the increasingly unpredictable and personalized nature of the content that users consume challenges the efficiency of existing caching-based solutions in which only exact content reuse is explored. This paper generalizes the cache-aided coded multicast problem to a source compression with distributed side information problem that specifically accounts for the correlation among the content files. It is shown how joint file compression during the caching and delivery phases can provide load reductions that go beyond those achieved with existing schemes. This is accomplished through a lower bound on the fundamental rate-memory trade-off {{as well as a}} correlation-aware achievable scheme, shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art correlation-unaware solutions, while approaching the limiting rate-memory trade-off.
