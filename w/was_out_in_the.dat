5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in hot and humid conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E
5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bedser batted on in steady {{support of}} Edrich. The pair saw England to lunch without further loss, and 155 runs were added {{for the third}} wicket before Bedser <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second session after almost three hours of batting. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test career best 79 before {{returning}} a catch to the off spin of Johnson. Edrich fell to Johnson after three further runs were added with the score at 426/4. He had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six. With two new batsmen at the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp for five and after Compton and Yardley added 26 for the sixth wicket, the former edged Lindwall and Saggers had his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. Playing in his first Test of the summer, Loxton then successively removed Cranston, Evans and Laker as England fell from 486/6 to 496/9. Miller then bowled the English skipper Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two. Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury. With Barnes injured, Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Bedser removed Morris for six with the new ball, to leave Australia at 13/1, before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63/1. Bradman did {{the majority of the}} scoring in the late afternoon, finishing unbeaten on 31 in a partnership of 40.|$|E

25|$|Crawshaw {{made his}} Wednesday debut on 1 September 1894, {{the opening day}} of the 1894–95 season, in a 1–3 away defeat at Everton. He made an {{immediate}} impact in the side missing only two matches that season and was called up for the England side before the season <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following campaign Crawshaw was part of the Wednesday side which won the FA Cup, he played in all six ties, scoring in the 3–1 semi-final replay victory over Bolton Wanderers. However he did make an uncharacteristic mistake in the final against Wolves when an error allowed David Black to equalise before Wednesday went on to win 2–1 through two Fred Spiksley goals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Nitschke was {{prominent}} with both bat and ball as Australia batted first. After Villani <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first over, Nitschke and new batsman Poulton counter-attacked. They brought up Australia's 50 in 33 balls, scoring 41 from 27 balls. Poulton was out for 39 after {{a stand of}} 58 runs in 37 balls, and Nitschke was eventually out for the top-score of 44 from 32 balls, including seven fours. This left the score at 3/101 after 11.2 overs, but Australia were unable to capitalise, and were bowled out for 155 in the last over after losing 6/16. Nitschke then took 2/21 from her four overs, removing Trisha Chetty and Susan Benade in the 11th and 13th overs as Australia completed a 22-run win. She was named the player of the match for her effort.|$|E

25|$|His form dropped {{slightly}} {{as he continued}} to make 40s and 30s but failed to convert to 50s and larger scores. He was given a chance to regain this lost form when Pakistan U19 toured England in August 2007. Godleman opened the innings with Alex Wakely and the two shared a relatively slow but prolific opening partnership which ended at 198 when Wakely departed for 112. Godleman fell soon after for 71 but England went on to amass 532 all out. Pakistan U19 were then bowled out for 214 and 260 resulting in England winning by an innings and 58 runs. The second test saw another good opening partnership of 95 and this time Godleman went on to make a U19 Test Match century, eventually being caught out on 115. He <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings however for a duck as Pakistan {{went on to win the}} 2nd test by 3 wickets and level the series at 1–1.|$|E
25|$|Post tea-break, Sehwag and Dravid steadied the Indian innings {{further and}} carried forward to 278/1 along with Dravid, who, having come off 305 runs in Adelaide, {{had made a}} patient 49 from 89 balls with 5 boundaries. Steve Waugh gave himself an {{extended}} bowling spell, and against the run of play, produced a delivery which was well outside leg-stump, but Dravid aimed a shot to Damien Martyn at forward square leg, and it appeared that Dravid, who had faced a lot of short deliveries from Waugh, had not anticipated this delivery. Dravid's dismissal apparently did not hamper Sehwag's rapid progress, as he whipped a delivery to square-leg boundary with a flourish, off Brad Williams in the next over after the second wicket. However, Tendulkar was soon dismissed by Lee, trying to work a delivery in the legside fine. He was the third wicket to fall at 286/3. The Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle to join Sehwag, whose response to the two quick wickets was to just smash a MacGill delivery next over for a six above midwicket. However, Sehwag's approach hastened his end, as he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 78th over, bowled by Simon Katich, the next ball after he had hit a six.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Ricky Ponting {{brought on}} {{part-time}} spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the 11th over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden {{on the fifth}} ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after 11 overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the 15th over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole 17 runs off the 17th over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries {{towards the end of}} the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.|$|E

25|$|Pietersen had a less {{successful}} {{time in the}} three Test matches against Pakistan, which England lost 2–0. He made little impact {{in the first and}} third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went on to lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England in difficulty, Pietersen edged Danish Kaneria to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings. He fared better in the second, however, making his second Test century in the first innings. He brought up his hundred with a six before next ball, he top-edged a pull and <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next innings, with England needing to bat out a draw, England were 20–4 but he made 42 to help England get the draw. He was also performing well in the one-day series with two explosive innings of 56 from 39 balls to help England win the first ODI, and 28 from 27 balls in the second. The quick-scoring innings in the second ODI was to be Pietersen's last on the tour. A rib injury sustained in the first ODI proved too painful throughout the second, and Pietersen returned to England to recover fully for the tour of India.|$|E

Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna.

2500|$|England batted {{first on}} what was {{described}} as a [...] "beautiful wicket", but Fry <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third over, caught behind by the wicketkeeper standing back, and captain Archie MacLaren was then run out for nine after a [...] "misunderstanding". After 50 minutes at the crease, Ranjitsinhji, who was described as [...] "upset" [...] by getting the blame for MacLaren's run out, was bowled by second-change bowler Warwick Armstrong for 13, and England were 35 for three. Jackson then batted until lunch with Tyldesley, and had made 53 when he inside edged Ernie Jones shortly afterwards. Wicketkeeper Lilley followed, having skied a ball from Noble to Jones, while Tyldesley had the luck to survive three dropped catches. Tyldesley went on to make a [...] "turning point" [...] partnership with Hirst for 94 in 80 minutes, while Jessop was caught at deep cover having made six and played [...] "very wild cricket".

[...] Murphy's father had a reputation as an athlete, and Murphy's desire as a youth was to become a great athlete. He has been variously reported to have traveled the country participating in [...] "six-day races" [...] at the age of 20 and to have been a boxer and a minor league baseball player. Some accounts state that {{he was part of the}} world's champion Natick Hook and Ladder racing team of the early 1880s with Keene Fitzpatrick, Steve Farrell, Pooch Donovan, Piper Donovan, Johnny Mack and Sid Peet. According to his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "his ambition was to stand out prominently as a six-day pedestrian and at the age of eighteen he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world trying to win fame and fortune on the tan bark track."

2500|$|India's run chase {{was made}} even more {{difficult}} after their trump card, Sachin Tendulkar, <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first over after skying a pull shot, Glenn McGrath completing the caught and bowled. Nevertheless, Virender Sehwag's (82 from 81 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) run-a-ball half century gave India respectability as they maintained a high scoring rate. Their only realistic hope—a washout—looked a possibility as the game was interrupted by rain with India at 3/103 after 17 overs. However, this rain passed by, and India's hopes were dashed when Sehwag was run out by Darren Lehmann, and again when Rahul Dravid (47 from 57 balls, 2 fours) was bowled by Andy Bichel, ending their partnership of 88 runs in 13.2 overs. India's batsmen continued to throw wickets away in the chase as the run rate crept up past 7 an over, and they were finally bowled out for 234 (all out, 39.2 overs) at a run rate of 5.97 runs an over giving Australia an emphatic victory by a record margin (in World Cup finals thus far) of 125 runs, underlining their dominance of the tournament. Ponting was named [...] "Man of the Match", and Sachin Tendulkar was named [...] "Player of the Series." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{attaining}} adulthood, David King obtained an apprenticeship as a {{store clerk}} in Portsmouth, Ohio, {{where he met}} teenage Almena Caldwell. Her older brother and father fell from a small boat and drowned in the nearby Scioto River. [...] Soon thereafter, Almena's mother died. [...] Her uncle Hannibal Gilman Hamlin (first cousin to Lincoln's first Vice President, Hannibal Hamlin) became the guardian of her and her brother, Hamlin Caldwell, moved them to Cincinnati and saw to their education. David King married her there when she was seventeen. [...] Gotwald wrote a biography of his parents-in-law in which he pointed out sternly that Almena {{was too young to}} marry at seventeen. The Kings moved to Tarlton, Ohio, where they opened a general store. [...] Several of Robert Quigley's (her father's foster father) grandchildren moved to Springfield, Ohio. So, David and Almena King moved there as well in 1840. [...] David proceeded to build a significant portion of early downtown Springfield, which was known for long thereafter as [...] "King's Row". David King died on August 8, 1849 in a cholera epidemic, which he contracted while caring for other victims of the outbreak.
