60|$|The allocution under {{consideration}} {{has a certain}} papal flavour. Mr. Harrison speaks with authority and not {{as one of the}} common scribes of the period. He knows not only what agnosticism is and how it has come about, but what <b>will</b> <b>become</b> of <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> agnostic is to content himself with being the precursor of the positivist.

But let not these scientific Sanballats presume that they are good enough {{to take part in the}} building of the Temple--they are mere Samaritans, doomed to die out in proportion as the Religion of Humanity is accepted by mankind.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{discusses}} {{some issues}} of the software development paradigm called Model Driven Development (MDD). Its basic idea is to move software development {{to a higher level}} of abstraction by using models as primary artifacts, and to transform models into the source code, with the aid of tools. Currently, there are several approaches to the realization of MDD paradigm which should bring a lot of benefits. However there are still problems to be solved, which will be discussed here. The authors are also going to analyze developers pros and cons, and give their own opinion about today's open question: <b>Will</b> MDD <b>become</b> a failure in trying to deal with software crisis, like the idea of CASE tools in 80 's or <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> future of software development...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} youths 2 ̆ 7 {{expectations about}} nicotine dependence {{to determine if}} these might explain the early appearance of symptoms. A convenience sample of 9 th graders (n= 460) completed a survey that asked them to imagine they were a novice teen smoker and an inveterate adult smoker and indicate whether they would expect to experience real and bogus symptoms of nicotine dependence. Responses were compared to actual symptom reports from 1375 adolescent novice smokers and 1102 adult smokers. The pattern of symptoms experienced by teen smokers did not match the pattern of symptoms expected by nonsmokers, but matched that of adult smokers almost exactly. The pattern of symptoms expected by novice teen smokers did not match the pattern of symptoms they reported experiencing.

40|$|Many old Olympic stadiums are “white elephants” {{because they}} are {{valuable}} and the owners cannot dispose of them, {{but the cost of}} upkeep is out of proportion. This was proven to be a problem in Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics: Beijing National Stadium costs $ 9 million to maintain annually and there was not a permanent tenant slated to use the facility. The stadium has seen only two major events since the Games concluded. This is a problem. This project proposes an Olympic stadium that is designed with a secondary purpose. London has already taken steps to improve the problem by constructing a temporary stadium for its 2012 event. This is a major step forward, but there are still unanswered questions.

Our goal is to develop the NIL fabrication techniques including the functions: hot embossing, UV curing and micro contact printing. The instruments installation will be completed {{in the end of}} 2005 and opened for service in the Q 3 of 2006. Another achievement in this year is the fabrication of NIL molds. The hot embossing molds were fabricated with the line width 110 nm and the height 180 nm. We also fabricated the nano-scale micro contact printing mold with the line width 83 nm and the height 365 nm and the nano-dots with 100 nm diameter and 300 nm height.

40|$|The {{sport of}} golf {{returned}} {{as an official}} event at the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro following a prolonged absence from the Games. To accommodate golf’s return, the city of Rio endorsed {{the construction of the}} Olympic golf course on land adjoining the Marapendi lagoon—land historically known to be ecologically valuable and environmentally protected. With the Games rapidly approaching, the city quickly passed complementary Law 125, stripping this land of its environmental protection, and instead authorizing a golf course as a sustainable use of the land. Local environmentalists have challenged the legislation and the city’s decision, arguing that large-scale economic incentives associated with hosting the Games have shoved aside long-term environmental preservation measures. Many argue that the decision to construct the Olympic course is shortsighted given the sport’s unpopularity in Brazil and the course’s uncertain future beyond the Closing Ceremony. This paper provides a holistic synopsis of the Olympic golf course as its construction has displaced much of the wildlife that once called the area home. While the immediate effects of Complementary Law 125 and the Olympic course construction are apparent, the long-term ones are more uncertain. As environmental goals yield to economic ones, dissension between city officials and environmentalists continues to grow. Only one thing is certain: the Olympic course will be used for those 16 days in August 2016, but what <b>will</b> <b>become</b> of <b>it</b> once <b>the</b> Olympic torch is extinguished—only time will tell...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} digital (new) media has caused both {{challenges}} and threats to newspapers’ continuing existence as a profitable and influential mass medium. While {{this is not}} the first time in history that new media appear to be challenging the future of the newspaper medium, from one perspective digital media offer not only direct competition, or alternative ways to produce and deliver news, but also possibilities for convergence, for making new media part of the traditional newspaper, inducing whole new possibilities for publishing. From another perspective, the newspaper medium is an old concept; a powerful mass medium with very profound consumption patterns, strongly associated with its traditional output medium: ink-on-paper. The purpose of the present work has been to examine the impacts digital media have on the old, well-established newspaper medium, and what consequences these impacts have for the future of newspaper as a mass medium, that is, is the medium the message? In order to achieve this aim, the present work has been carried out from three different angles: digital media, publishing and reading behaviour and presentation factors. The areas have been examined using several methods: instrumental experiment, eye-tracking experiment, secondary analysis, and case study design. Newspapers’ ’to be or not to be’ depends, in a theoretical sense, on what media constitute. The medium is the message in the sense that, in the definition of a mass medium, the strength of the newspaper message is that it is recognized as <b>the</b> newspaper concept. <b>It</b> is not, in that the message per se is dependent on <b>the</b> medium <b>it</b> is reproduced on, as a newspaper can be considered a newspaper even if presented on a digital medium, yet the specific way the content is presented will always depend on the technology and characteristics of the chosen output medium. Thus, while defusing the output medium’s significance for the concept, the strength of the newspaper, and its industry, lies in what hitherto constitutes the message: accurate, credible, serendipitous, and diverse content, but which is continuously adapted to the technology of the output medium, thus benefiting from it and further strengthening the developed, digitalized newspaper concept, or what <b>will</b> <b>become</b> of <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> newspaper industry has great potential to differentiate itself in a world where news is becoming increasingly commoditized, though it must further emphasize its power, which lies in the long-defined ‘old’ newspaper concept. Moreover, the industry must be aware of the fact that this refashioning and adaptation is a slow process. QC 2010080...|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} surveys and {{trials of the}} 1940s and 1950s, when both Queensland and News South Wales {{government}} agriculture departments were visiting Colliston, the H2 Hinde proved itself to be a heavy-bearing Australian variety. When commercial interests began {{to invest in the}} industry during the early 1960s, led by the Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd (later CSR Ltd), the H2 Hinde, only one other Australian cultivar, and a number of Hawaiian cultivars were deemed most suitable for commercial cultivation; the H2 being most appropriate for locations with a temperate climate. From the 1960s and into the 1980s the H2 Hinde as an Australian variety was widely cultivated in the country's commercial macadamia orchards, most notably in New South Wales, {{and to a lesser extent}} in Queensland where CSR and its preferences for Hawaiian cultivars predominated. This situation did not change until it was determined that the Hawaiian cultivars did not yield as highly in Australia and further research had to be done to develop more home-grown varieties. This work was led by the Australian Macadamia Society, which was formed out of Queensland in 1974, under the auspices of its Technical Advisory Committee (established in 1980), and <b>the</b> monies <b>it</b> levied from members. A survey of Australian growers revealed that the H2 Hinde was still considered a major variety in 1983. And when varietal performance trials were being conducted a decade later, the H2 Hinde was deemed an industry standard. Currently the two States equally share Australia's world-dominating macadamia export market, but large plantings in Queensland <b>will</b> ensure <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>the</b> major future producer.|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{software}} is, at times, hard to find. No {{piece of}} software can be guaranteed {{to work in}} every situation that may arise during its use here at Glenn Research Center or in space. The job of the Software Assurance (SA) group in the Risk Management Office is to rigorously test the software {{in an effort to}} ensure <b>it</b> matches <b>the</b> contract specifications. In some cases the SA team also researches new alternatives for selected software packages. This testing and research {{is an integral part of}} the department of Safety and Mission Assurance. Real Time operation in reference to a computer system is a particular style of handing the timing and manner with which inputs and outputs are handled. A real time system executes these commands and appropriate processing within a defined timing constraint. Within this definition there are two other classifications of real time systems: hard and soft. A soft real time system is one in which if the particular timing constraints are not rigidly met there will be no critical results. On the other hand, a hard real time system is one in which if the timing constraints are not met the results could be catastrophic. An example of a soft real time system is a DVD decoder. If the particular piece of data from the input is not decoded and displayed to the screen at exactly the correct moment nothing critical <b>will</b> <b>become</b> of <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> user may not even notice it. However, a hard real time system is needed to control the timing of fuel injections or steering on the Space Shuttle; a delay of even a fraction of a second could be catastrophic in such a complex system. The current real time system employed by most NASA projects is Wind River's VxWorks operating system. This is a proprietary operating system that can be configured to work with many of NASA s needs and it provides very accurate and reliable hard real time performance. The down side is that since it is a proprietary operating system it is also costly to implement. The prospect of replacing this somewhat costly implementation is the focus of one of the SA group s current research projects. The explosion of open source software in the last ten years has led to the development of a multitude of software solutions which were once only produced by major corporations. The benefits of these open projects include faster release and bug patching cycles as well as inexpensive if not free software solutions. The main packages for hard real time solutions under Linux are Real Time Application Interface (RTAI) and two varieties of Real Time Linux (RTL), RTLFree and RTLPro. During my time here at NASA I have been testing various hard real time solutions operating as layers on the Linux Operating System. All testing is being run on an Intel SBC 2590 which is a common embedded hardware platform. The test plan was provided to me by the Software Assurance group at the start of my internship and my job has been to test the systems by developing and executing the test cases on the hardware. These tests are constructed so that the Software Assurance group can get hard test data for a comparison between the open source and proprietary implementations of hard real time solutions...|$|R
