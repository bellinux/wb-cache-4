It's an {{anthology}} of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich√©s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a <b>wind-up</b> <b>machine</b> to generate emotions, pure movie without message.|$|E

"Gramophone" [...] {{generally}} {{referred to}} a <b>wind-up</b> <b>machine.</b> After {{the introduction of the}} softer vinyl records, -rpm LPs (long-playing records) and 45-rpm [...] "single" [...] or two-song records, and EPs (extended-play recordings), the common name became [...] "record player" [...] or [...] "turntable". Often the home record player was part of a system that included a radio (radiogram) and, later, might also play audiotape cassettes. From about 1960, such a system began to be described as a [...] "hi-fi" [...] (high-fidelity, monophonic) or a [...] "stereo" [...] (most systems being stereophonic by the mid-1960s).|$|E

During the 1920s he found work on a newspaper but was stricken with lung and rib infections and possibly also suffered a mental breakdown. On the advice of his doctors, he maintained, he moved around 1924 to Tryon, North Carolina, in an attempt to recover his health, having originally intended to go to Florida. In Tryon he found friends, joined an amateur theater group, and at some point began writing down the words of African American spirituals and then making audio recording of them, using at first a makeshift, <b>wind-up</b> recording <b>machine</b> and paper-backed zinc discs (now inaudible), and, after 1930, a Presto disc recorder. Gellert's biographer Bruce Conforth relates that contrary to what has been written elsewhere, Gellert, who was fascinated with the striking beauty, especially, of African American religious music, was [...] "very slow" [...] to become interested in issues of racial justice and equality and was only pushed into it by his brother Hugo.|$|R
