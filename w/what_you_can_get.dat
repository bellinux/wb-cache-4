5000|$|During his Hall of Fame {{speech in}} 2006 Harry Carson does not {{directly}} mention CTE, but he does mention {{that he does not}} think the NFL is doing the best job they can to help out ex-NFL players. When he states [...] "I would hope that the leaders of the NFL, the future commissioner, and the player association do a much better job of looking out for those individuals. You got to look out for 'em. If we made the league <b>what</b> it is, <b>you</b> have to take better care of your own" [...] (Carson). Carson takes an aggressive stand when it comes to CTE and how the NFL handles their own ex-players that are struggling with head trauma later in their lives. Although Harry Carson was an excellent football player he does suggest that kids not start playing football because of the consequences that could come to them later in life. The NFL reached a concussion settlement of 765 million dollars for the former NFL players that sustained head injuries on the field. When Carson was asked about the settlement in a Frontline interview he says, [...] "And so I think everyone now has a better sense of <b>what</b> damage <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from playing football. And I think the NFL has given everybody 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football" [...] (Carson). Harry Carson thinks the huge settlement is good for the former players, but it also scares people away from playing football because of the chances of head trauma players could experience later in life.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years {{evolutionary}} biologists {{have used a}} fictional tale about engineer and businessman Henry Ford to help illustrate the undesirability of over-design. Thus, on discovering that kingpins were rarely damaged in scrapped Model T automobiles, Henry Ford {{is alleged to have}} concluded that the kingpins were unnecessarily durable and asked that they be built to a cheaper specification. The general lesson that has been drawn from this tale is that natural selection will act to equalize the mortality risks accruing from damage to each part of the organism’s body. Yet it is well known, {{at least as far as}} humans are concerned, that death is more likely to be attributed to a failure of some organs compared to others. To understand why this might be so, we use some graphical and mathematical models to show that even if all body organs were equally important to survivorship, then the optimal investment solution that maximizes whole-organism longevity will typically not be the solution that equalizes the fail-times of the individual organs. As with natural organisms, the key to any optimal investment policy in multi-component systems is understanding <b>what</b> ‘bang <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> for your buck’. Moreover, we use a specific model to show that, even following selection to ameliorate the effects of damage, those body parts that receive more damage are still more likely to be the ultimate cause of death that is, there is ‘under-compensation’. Therefore, the decision to make the kingpins more cheaply should not have been based only on the fact they rarely cause car failure compared to other car components. Such arguments wrongly assume that if one car part (or body part) is less durable than the others, then it will always be the reason for any future breakdown (or death) ...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Many small {{emerging}} engineering companies, in especially South Africa, employ only {{a single}} engineer (this is mainly due to the shortages of qualified engineering staff). The engineers in many small engineering companies {{find themselves in the}} situation where they are responsible for many areas and fields, from design, management and in some cases finances too. This leaves very little time to plan projects with the detailed attention that each and every project requires no matter how small or large. It was the famous and true words of Harvey MacKay, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail”, that if any project is undertaken without planning is going to fail on some level. It is undertaken, in this dissertation, to investigate the classical project management process and to ascertain the possibility of simplifying this process so that engineers in small engineering companies have an effective project management process that is economically feasible and will fit into already tight project time lines. A survey was conducted {{in order to get a}} good understanding of how project management is viewed in small engineering companies. The results of the survey support the theory that project management in small engineering companies is sadly lacking, and is viewed as an expense rather than a tool. Two case studies were performed; these highlight the value of project management. Initially poor project management leads to successful although late projects; with an improvement of the project breakdown structure and improved project management skills the second case study had some very surprising results. Finally the conclusion highlights that project management has very positive impacts on even the smallest of projects. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts when it comes to project management and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> put in is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> expect to <b>get</b> out...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Detroit {{is a city}} {{defined by}} making. The refrain “You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} made in Detroit ” is often quoted today even after the decline and relocation of the automotive industry. Given the condition of Detroit, the state of American manufacturing, {{and the fact that}} the city and its fabrication networks are illegible to newcomers and industry outsiders, the Re:Tool-Kit for Detroit research project questions the veracity of this claim. The project asks <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> really <b>get</b> made in Detroit today. Who are the makers operating in the city today? Where are the fabrication shops? How does fabrication shape the city today? And how is the culture of making in Detroit evolving in response to the changes in manufacturing, the rise of digital fabrication, and an influx of artist and craft based making? By mapping the fabrication landscape of the city, and packaging the research in a way that is accessible to designers, and students of art, architecture and design who may not be fabricators, the research seeks to create new opportunities for the under utilized fabrication capacity that already exists in Detroit and to encourage new collaborations between university and city, design and fabrication. Research for this study was gathered through 47 interviews conducted with a range of fabricators. Interviews were recorded and analyzed. Fabrication shops and fabricators were documented photographically and mapped. The research findings have been exhibited at the University of Michigan and will be available in the form of a website and a printed (and printable) “toolkit ” both of which contains a map, directory, journalistic case studies, and a series of historical vignettes documenting previous examples of industrial production collaborating with art and design in the city of Detroit. The research project has also entered into a partnership with a non-profit “designed to support Detroit’s growing creative economy ” called the Detroi...|$|R
60|$|Donkeys again. I know shy neighbourhoods {{where the}} Donkey goes {{in at the}} street door, and appears to live up-stairs, for I have {{examined}} the back-yard from over the palings, and {{have been unable to}} make him out. Gentility, nobility, Royalty, would appeal to that donkey in vain to do what he does for a costermonger. Feed him with oats at the highest price, put an infant prince and princess in a pair of panniers on his back, adjust his delicate trappings to a nicety, take him to the softest slopes at Windsor, and try <b>what</b> pace <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of him. Then, starve him, harness him anyhow to a truck with a flat tray on it, and see him bowl from Whitechapel to Bayswater. There appears to be no particular private understanding between birds and donkeys, in a state of nature; but in the shy neighbourhood state, you shall see them always in the same hands and always developing their very best energies for the very worst company. I have known a donkey--by sight; we were not on speaking terms--who lived over on the Surrey side of London-bridge, among the fastnesses of Jacob's Island and Dockhead. It was the habit of that animal, when his services were not in immediate requisition, to go out alone, idling. I have met him a mile from his place of residence, loitering about the streets; and the expression of his countenance at such times was most degraded. He was attached to the establishment of an elderly lady who sold periwinkles, and he used to stand on Saturday nights with a cartful of those delicacies outside a gin-shop, pricking up his ears when a customer came to the cart, and too evidently deriving satisfaction from the knowledge that they got bad measure. His mistress was sometimes overtaken by inebriety. The last time I ever saw him (about five years ago) he was in circumstances of difficulty, caused by this failing. Having been left alone with the cart of periwinkles, and forgotten, he went off idling. He prowled among his usual low haunts for some time, gratifying his depraved tastes, until, not taking the cart into his calculations, he endeavoured to turn up a narrow alley, and became greatly involved. He was taken into custody by the police, and, the Green Yard of the district being near at hand, was backed into that place of durance. At that crisis, I encountered him; the stubborn sense he evinced of being--not to compromise the expression--a blackguard, I never saw exceeded in the human subject. A flaring candle in a paper shade, stuck in among his periwinkles, showed him, with his ragged harness broken and his cart extensively shattered, twitching his mouth and shaking his hanging head, a picture of disgrace and obduracy. I have seen boys being taken to station-houses, who were as like him as his own brother.|$|R
