Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E

Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk elaborated on the song's composition: [...] "'I Was Here' is Beyoncé's monument to the ages. The song climbs higher and higher, chorus by chorus, until Beyoncé reaches her apex, delivering some of her best vocals on the album. The lyrics are a bit uninspired, overly triumphant but somewhat humble as the singer contemplates her mark on history. Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career, Beyoncé is far from satisfied." ...|$|E

500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel." [...] Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E

2500|$|... "Part II (On the Run)" [...] is {{a smooth}} slow-tempo electro-R love ballad which is {{equipped}} with a steamy, retro and retro-futuristic groove that creates an acute level of moody texture. It is instrumentally complete with keyboards and drums. Jon Pareles, a writer of The New York Times noted that it was the closest song to pop music on Magna Carta Holy Grail. Pareles further noted that Timbaland's production sets aside his usual brittle tones to hint at the keyboard confections of 1980's Lionel Richie and Don Henley. Lyrically, the song speaks about a rebellious couple that is desperately in love. The song opens with an airy prelude during which Beyoncé sings the lines, [...] "Who <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> perfect love story anyway anyway / Cliché cliché cliché. Who <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> hero love that saves the day anyway, cliché cliché cliché" [...] in dreamy lead vocals along with breathy harmonies. Jay-Z and Beyoncé further trade verses about fugitives finding romance, with Beyoncé singing, [...] "I hear sirens while we make love" [...] and slowly exhaling in the song, singing in her lower register, swearing that she can still hold her lover's heart and gun. She further denounces the couple's own love story as [...] "a toast to clichés in a dark past" [...] over dizzy, diving synths and drums which sound like [...] "they came out of Eric B's basement," [...] as stated by Grant Jones of the website Rap Reviews. With the lines: [...] "If it's you and me against the world/ Then so be it," [...] Jay-Z notes the criticism towards the couple when they first went public with [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and the lines referencing Tupac Shakur in the song. He further acknowledges that if anyone attacks his girlfriend he would kill them: [...] "Cross the line, speak about mine/ I'mma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine/ Touch a ni--a where his rib at/ I click clat/ Push your muh'fuckin' wig back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the switch}} to Amp, the station began {{attracting}} controversy {{for a number of}} unconventional on-air promotions. In June 2011, CKMP held a contest known as Breast Summer Ever—in which the station would give away a breast implant, valued at $10,000. Entrants submitted a photo of themselves and explained why they wanted the implant; a shortlist of 10 entries were chosen by judges, and the winner was decided by an online poll. The contest was met with mixed reaction; the station's program manager Kris Mazurak stated that the contest had received a positive reaction, given that [...] "somebody out there that <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> prize", while a critic believed that the promotion could have a positive response if the prize were to go to someone in legitimate need of a breast implant, such as a woman suffering from breast cancer. However, the station also received criticism for the promotion, particularly from those who felt that it was sexist and promoted the objectification of women (even though the station did not specifically restrict the contest to females), and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council received two complaints about the contest upon its introduction. After receiving 76% of 30,000 votes, the implant was awarded to a trans woman who had been affected by the provincial government's decision to drop funding for gender reassignment operations as part of budget cuts.|$|E
2500|$|Messy Little Raindrops {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A predominantly positive review came from Jon O'Brien of AllMusic who awarded it {{four out of}} five stars, saying that [...] "Messy Little Raindrops is a cohesive and adventurous follow-up that will undoubtedly continue [...] ascent into pop's premier league", and praising the songs [...] "Promise This", [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Happy Tears". Tom Hocknell of BBC Music was generally positive, labeling Messy Little Raindrops a [...] "competent and frequently enjoyable pop album." [...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media noticed that with Messy Little Raindrops Cole is [...] "returning to base" [...] and described it as [...] "good, clean, family-friendly fun". The Daily Mirror also gave three stars, noting an improvement from 3 Words as well as Cole's perseverance. Daily Mail also gave the album three stars out of five; the article praised Cole's vocals, but said [...] "as she strives to find a niche for herself as a solo artist, Cole is suffering from an identity crisis." [...] Critics noted a large amount of filler. Lisa Wright of Dotmusic said, [...] "if there are no hooks, no catchy melody or at least something to put a swagger in your step then you're left with a song that's lyrically obvious and musically banal - and no-one <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> [...] Of course it's not all bad and 'Messy Little Raindrops' still shines with moments of pop brilliance." ...|$|E

Pickard {{explained}} that when Cindy ends the relationship because he does not plan to marry her, his character is shocked that he [...] "misses Cindy. They talk things through and, out of the blue, Tony proposes in jest. But Cindy goes along with it..." [...] He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating him for a while.

He added that Cindy is [...] "acting like she genuinely loves him and he desperately <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> love" [...] so he remains unsuspicious towards her and her plans to scam him. Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has [...] "some feelings" [...] for Tony. He felt that Tony has [...] "fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to mean a lot to him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together". Pickard felt that if his character discovered Cindy and Darren Osborne's (Ashley Taylor Dawson) plans to scam him he would be [...] "furious but also he'd be really down about it. It would upset him to think they were trying to con him but he'd be angry with himself for being so gullible".

2500|$|In {{relation}} to Gavin's first scenes with Kathy's former husband Phil, {{it was said}} that Gavin [...] "will not be taking no for an answer" [...] and he [...] "doesn't take things quietly", with Treadwell-Collins calling the storyline [...] "a really exciting thriller". Further scenes between Phil and Gavin prompted Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy to think that Phil [...] "may have met his match". A show insider told Inside Soap, [...] "He's not afraid to get his hands dirty, even [...] it means butting heads with the notorious Mitchell family. Phil should watch out—this one's a real handful!" [...] On the storyline where Gavin has Phil kidnapped and demands money to spare his life, an EastEnders insider told Inside Soap, [...] "Gavin knows which buttons to push to frighten Kathy into doing exactly what he wants. He <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> money, he wants her by his side, and if things don't go as he wants, Phil is going to pay a high price." [...] Treadwell-Collins said of the kidnap storyline: [...] "What Gavin does to Phil while he's off screen will take Phil in a whole new direction that will run into next year [...]" [...] Taylforth confirmed that what Gavin does to Phil is the reason Phil starts drinking again, saying [...] "Gavin knows that drinking is Phil's weakness". This has an ongoing impact on Phil and the Mitchells, with Treadwell-Collins calling Phil [...] "a broken man" [...] and confirming it was the start of a storyline that would continue until Easter 2016. The Daily Mail said, [...] "Gavin exploited Phil's weakness for alcohol, forcing him to consume booze and setting him off on a potentially deadly slippery slope." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how I felt when I read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she <b>wants</b> <b>that</b> security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
