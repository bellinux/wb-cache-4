5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take off.|$|E
5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E

5|$|Chana's first {{teacher was}} D.C. Sears, an Oregon, Illinois resident. The late 19th century saw {{at least ten}} {{individuals}} teach at Chana School at different times. By 1888, Pine Rock Township was ready {{to address the question}} of <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> build a high school; Chana students attended high school in Oregon. The question was brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{information}} {{learned from the}} 2002 and 2006 expeditions, there was {{public support for the}} making of Davidson Seamount into a marine sanctuary. A key group of research scientists, fishermen, officials, educators, and marine biologists was formed in 2006 to discuss <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make Davidson Seamount a National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and if so whether to make it its own sanctuary, or incorporate it into the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The group decided that the seamount was eligible for sanctuary designation, and the majority of the group recommended its incorporation into the nearby Monterey Bay sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} 5.cxd5, Black has {{an eccentric}} option in 5...Bd6, the Snake Benoni. But most players prefer 5...d6, which stops White's d-pawn from advancing to d6. Black's {{control over the}} central dark squares d4 and e5 will then be augmented by fianchettoing the bishop on g7. Meanwhile, White must decide <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> play 6.e4. Although this move gains space in the centre, it also gives Black a target of attack on the half-open e-file. White can deny Black this target {{for the time being}} by playing 6.Nf3 first.|$|E

The following night, Jerry asks Marlene {{to come to his}} apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were {{concerns that the}} bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 {{that the government was}} in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{leadership}} was divided over <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> defend pro-Nazi {{speech in the}} United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E
5|$|The secessionist officers, {{pleased at}} Quwatli's statements, {{discussed}} <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have Quwatli serve another term as president or {{to finish the}} term he began in 1955, which was cut about one year short {{as a result of}} the UAR's establishment. The proposal did not manifest, largely due to Quwatli's relatively old age at the time. On 8 March 1963 a coalition of unionist officers consisting of Ba'athists, Nasserists and independent Arab nationalists overthrew the secessionist government of President Nazim al-Qudsi and Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm. Quwatli left Syria shortly after and moved to Beirut, Lebanon.|$|E
