25|$|Many Tunisians, who had {{manifested}} {{a desire}} to modernize before the French came, clearly appreciated the many improvements that the French Protectorate rather quickly accomplished, and those yet planned. Understandably, of course, they chafed at being made second-class citizens in their own country. In French public relations, the major point that would win Tunisian favor was the French ability to modernize the economy and administration. Tunisians, however, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> in the work and rewards of the new French-built enterprises. Eventually, the more far-seeing among resident French administrators were drawn to draft French development plans so as to include significant participation by the Tunisian people. Nonetheless, other French administrators were more inclinded to award business and employment opportunities to French settlers, for both local political reasons and colonial policy.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-18th century, Charlestown was {{the hub of}} the Atlantic {{trade of}} England's {{southern}} colonies. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the African slaves brought to North America between 1700 and 1775. The plantations and the economy based on them made it the wealthiest city in British North America and the largest south of Philadelphia. Its 11,000 inhabitants—half slaves—made it the 4th-largest port after Boston, New York, and Philadelphia in 1770. The money also paid for cultural and social development. Charlestown saw America's first theater building in 1736 at the site of today's Dock Street Theater. StMichael's was erected in 1753. Benevolent societies were formed by the Huguenots, free people of color, Germans, and Jews. The Library Society was established in 1748 by well-born young men who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the financial cost {{to keep up with the}} scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the town's college in 1770, the first in the colony. Until its transition to state ownership in 1970, it remained the oldest municipally supported college in the United States.|$|E
25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same thing, there {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.|$|E
