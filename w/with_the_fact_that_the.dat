5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, and because {{most of it was}} {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus's reign, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Panama Canal {{was not yet}} open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With {{the opening of the}} Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E

5|$|Following the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships {{were being held}} in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April.

5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion years ago, {{it is thought that}} the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water {{and the rise of the}} levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E

Pennsylvanian, {{on the west side of}} the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to New York. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that Pennsylvanian would sail on a San Francisco– Panama Canal– Boston route, sailing opposite of , Honolulan, and sister ship Washingtonian. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including Pennsylvanian, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E

5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value is also consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used {{as a part of}} the characterization of determinants.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{announced}} {{a follow-up to}} Sonic Adventure and a spinoff (which would become Sonic Shuffle) on October 4, 1999. The newly named Sonic Adventure 2 appeared at E3 2000, with Sonic Team adding video shown there to its website on June 30. Sonic Team posted a trailer {{and a number of}} screenshots on May 30, 2001, with Sega promoting Sonic Adventure 2 as the last Sonic game for the Dreamcast and as marking the series' 10th anniversary. Sega held a 10th-anniversary party for Sonic in June 2001, at which attendees could compete in a battle tournament; the winner played against Iizuka. The GameCube, rather than the competing Xbox or PlayStation 2, was chosen for a port of Sonic Adventure 2 because of its 56k technology. Sega and Sonic Team USA were unconcerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Xbox would feature broadband Internet connectivity, and the GameCube would not.|$|E
5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who come to New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{projects}} ran out {{of funding}} due to the 1975–1976 New York City fiscal crisis, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MTA {{did not have a}} consistent funding source (its five-year Capital Programs were implemented in 1982 due to further decline in the subway after 1975–1976). Expected to be completed by the mid-1970s and early 1980s, lines for the Program for Action had to be reduced or canceled altogether due to the crisis. Because of the fiscal crisis, the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street lines, the only two complete lines to be built under the program, were truncated and delayed, and there were plans to abandon the expansions altogether.|$|E
