As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side.

500|$|The idea of {{the need}} to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the {{ceremony}} a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of RichardII who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the City of London by the lord mayor, aldermen and the livery companies, and he was conducted to the Tower of London where he spent the night in vigil. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the public conduits flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in Cheapside, probably to represent the New Jerusalem, where a girl blew gold leaf over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of CharlesII in 1661. Charles's pageant was watched by Samuel Pepys who wrote: [...] "So glorious was the show with gold and silver that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> look at it". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from Westminster Hall to the abbey. For the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1831, a state procession from StJames's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.|$|E

60|$|The {{conduct of}} some of the European states during our {{troubles}} shows the lack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not come upon a single individual.

We might, possibly, after a while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of their institutions. Hence, England was constantly finding fault with the administration at Washington because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep up an effective blockade. She also joined, at first, with France and Spain in setting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, totally disregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as an independent power.

In the third place, he cannot address any meetings, because the halls all belong to the State. The whole of the press is, of course, official; no independent daily is permitted. In spite of all these obstacles, the Mensheviks have succeeded in winning about 40 seats out of 1,500 on the Moscow Soviet, by being known in certain large factories where the electoral campaign could be conducted by word of mouth.
