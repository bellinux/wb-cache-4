Nor <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised.

25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J.

The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested.

Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd's portrayal of the pageant choreographer a [...] "finely etched semiautobiographical performance". He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film Movie Movie, which was directed by [...] Stanley Donen, with whom he'd worked in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and It's Always Fair Weather. Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy Laverne and Shirley (1990), as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos, <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> of You (1986) and Alright (1990).

500|$|Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied {{himself by}} making new {{arrangements}} of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 {{he told his}} secretary, Santeri Levas, that he hoped to complete a [...] "great work" [...] before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: [...] "I cannot sleep at nights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it." [...] In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: [...] "For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, {{it has to be}} something that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues."

Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was [...] "by far" [...] her favorite actor, praising his [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially [...]|$|E

When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E

500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further.

And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida.

Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E

He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement."

The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert's death left Ernest [...] "wretched", noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, in which her mother Princess Louise [...] "had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers"; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter [...] "You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I am always alarmed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix".
