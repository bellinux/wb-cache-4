5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, {{as she was}} tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989.

In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E

5|$|On 18 December 1283, a {{few days}} after Ludgarda's funeral, Greater Poland {{witnessed}} an extremely important event for later history of Poland: the consecration of Jakub Świnka as Archbishop of Gniezno. The event took place in the Franciscan church in Kalisz and was extremely important because after twelve years (since the death in 1271 of Archbishop Janusz Tarnowa) Poland wasn't a full-recognized prelate. Jakub Świnka received the papal nomination on 30 July 1283, however, because he was only a deacon, it was necessary to ordain him. This ceremony took place on 18 December and a day later Jakub received the episcopal consecration. The ceremony, according to sources, was assisted by five Polish bishops and Przemysł II, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> new Archbishop an expensive ring as a gift.|$|E

The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.|$|E

5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> surrender is not known.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{returned}} to the national team replacing the injured Gambhir in Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award. Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found {{a place in the}} home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. Kohli {{returned to}} the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1. The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> award to Kohli.|$|E
5|$|Mustafa Pasha was succeeded as {{governor}} of Gaza by his son Ridwan Pasha, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> Ridwan dynasty its name. Ridwan had formerly served as the treasurer of Yemen. In 1565, Ridwan Pasha was promoted to beylerbey ("governor-general") of Yemen {{for two years before}} returning to rule Gaza {{for a short period of}} time in 1567. Meanwhile, in 1566, Mustafa Pasha was deposed by the new sultan Selim II for his closeness to Bayazit, Selim's brother and rival for power. Mustafa Pasha died shortly thereafter. According to historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, Ridwan became governor of Gaza in 1570. By 1571, Ridwan Pasha had been promoted to vali ("provincial governor") of Habesh (Coastal Ethiopia), Basra and Diyarbekir in succession, while Bahram Pasha, a second son of Mustafa Pasha and a high-ranking official in the Ottoman government, became governor of Nablus in the mid-16th-century. After some time Bahram Pasha was promoted to beylerbey of Damascus and later amir al-hajj (commander of the hajj; pl. umara al-hajj), making him responsible for the Muslim pilgrimage caravan to Mecca.|$|E
