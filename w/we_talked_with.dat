[...] Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant, and it was Crystal who came up with the scene's classic punchline – [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines. Reiner recalls that at a test screening, all of the women in the audience were laughing while all of the men were silent.|$|E
2500|$|Tiana is {{loosely based}} on both Princess Emma, the heroine of Baker's novel, and the princess who appears in the Grimm fairy tale. Clements {{described}} Baker's The Frog Princess as [...] "a kind of fairy tale with a twist" [...] because in it [...] "the princess kissed the frog and instead of him turning into a prince she turned into a frog." [...] Clements and Musker pitched {{the idea for the}} film to Walt Disney Animation Studios CEO John Lasseter [...] "as a hand-drawn film with an African American heroine", conceiving Tiana [...] "as someone who would never have been a big fan of Disney fairy tales." [...] The character was inspired by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, who Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans. Clements elaborated, [...] "There's a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … we met with her and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> her and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, which is a big element of the movie." ...|$|E

60|$|After dinner <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> several Englishmen, {{and they}} {{inflamed}} {{our desire to}} a hotter degree than ever, to see the sights of Meiringen from the heights of the Bruenig Pass. They said the view was marvelous, and that one who had seen it once could never forget it. They also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass, and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock, {{in such a way}} that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by; and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience, for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind, like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> many of {{the natives}} about it, such as we could make {{ourselves}} intelligible to, but all that we could learn from them was, {{that there was a}} great land of lions beyond the sea, but that it was a great way off. We knew as well as they that it was a long way, but our people differed mightily about it; some said it was 150 leagues, others not above 100. One of our men, that had a map of the world, showed us by his scale that it was not above eighty leagues. Some said there were islands all the way to touch at, some that there were no islands at all. For my own part, I knew nothing of this matter one way or another, but heard it all without concern, whether it was near or far off; however, this we learned from an old man who was blind and led about by a boy, that if we stayed till the end of August, we should be sure of the wind to be fair and the sea smooth all the voyage.|$|E
60|$|We {{ascended the}} great Rocher above {{the palace of}} the popes, and on our way looked into the old church, which was so dim in the decline of day {{that we could not}} see within the dusky arches, through which the chapels communicated with the nave. Thence we pursued our way up the farther ascent, and, {{standing}} {{on the edge of the}} precipice,--protected by a parapet of stone, and in other places by an iron railing,--we could look down upon the road that winds its dusky track far below, and at the river Rhone, which eddies close beside it. This is indeed a massive and lofty cliff, and it tumbles down so precipitously that I could readily have flung myself from the bank, and alighted on my head in the middle of the river. The Rhone passes so near its base that I threw stones a good way into its current. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> a man of Avignon, who leaned over the parapet near by, and he was very kind in explaining the points of view, and told us that the river, which winds and doubles upon itself so as to look like at least two rivers, is really the Rhone alone. The Durance joins with it within a few miles below Avignon, but is here invisible.|$|E

6000|$|The {{inkstand}} is {{a beautiful}} specimen of silverwork. It is eighteen inches long, {{with a group of}} silver figures on it, representing Religion with the Bible in her hand, giving liberty to the slave. The slave is a masterly piece of work. He stands with his hands clasped, looking up to heaven, while a white man is knocking the shackles from his feet. But the prettiest part of the scene was the presentation of a gold pen, by a band of beautiful children, one of whom made a very pretty speech. I called the little things to come and stand around me, and talked with them a few minutes, and this was all the speaking that fell to my share. Now this, really, was too kind of these ladies, and of our brotherly friend Mr. S., and I was quite touched with it; especially as I have been able myself to do so very little, socially, for any body's pleasure. Mr. Sherman still has continued to be as thoughtful and careful as a brother could be; and his daughter, Mrs. B., I fear, has robbed her own family to give us the additional pleasure of her society. We rode out with her one day into the country, and saw her home and little family. Saturday morning we breakfasted at Stafford House, I wish you could have been there. All was as cool, and quiet, and still there, as in some retreat deep in the country. We went first into the duchess's boudoir,--you remember,--where is that beautiful crayon sketch of Lady Constance. The duchess was dressed in pale blue. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> her some time, before any one came in, about Miss Greenfield. I showed her a simple note to her grace in which Miss G. tried to express her gratitude, and which she had sent to me to correct for her. The duchess said, [...] "0, give it me! it is a great deal better as it is. I like it just as she wrote it." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} I went with Mr. Thompson {{to see what}} bargain could be made with vetturinos for taking myself and family to Florence. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> three or four, and found them asking prices of various enormity, from {{a hundred and fifty}} scudi down to little more than ninety; but Mr. Thompson says that they always begin in this way, and will probably come down to somewhere about seventy-five. Mr. Thompson took me into the Via Portoghese, and showed me an old palace, above which rose--not a very customary feature of the architecture of Rome--a tall, battlemented tower. At one angle of the tower we saw a shrine of the Virgin, with a lamp, and all the appendages of those numerous shrines which we see at the street-corners, and in hundreds of places about the city. Three or four centuries ago, this palace was inhabited by a nobleman who had an only son and a large pet monkey, and one day the monkey caught the infant up and clambered to this lofty turret, and sat there with him in his arms grinning and chattering like the Devil himself. The father was in despair, but was afraid to pursue the monkey lest he should fling down the child from the height of the tower and make his escape. At last he vowed that if the boy were safely restored to him he would build a shrine at the summit of the tower, and cause it to be kept as a sacred place forever. By and by the monkey came down and deposited the child on the ground; the father fulfilled his vow, built the shrine, and made it obligatory, on all future possessors of the palace to keep the lamp burning before it. Centuries have passed, the property has changed hands; but still there is the shrine on the giddy top of the tower, far aloft over the street, on the very spot where the monkey sat, and there burns the lamp, in memory of the father's vow. This being the tenure by which the estate is held, the extinguishment of that flame might yet turn the present owner out of the palace.|$|E
6000|$|I touched lately {{upon this}} theme {{with a friend}} who, I fancied, would {{understand}} me, and who immediately assured {{me that he had}} just spent a day that this mingled diversity of sensation made to the days one spends elsewhere what an uncommonly good novel may be to the daily paper. [...] "There was an air of idleness about it, if you will," [...] he said, [...] "and it was certainly pleasant enough to have been wrong. Perhaps, being after all unused to long stretches of dissipation, this was why I had a half-feeling that I was reading an odd chapter in the history of a person very much more of a héros de roman than myself." [...] Then he proceeded to relate how he had taken a long ride with a lady whom he extremely admired. [...] "We turned off from the Tor di Quinto Road to that castellated farm-house you know of--once a Ghibelline fortress-- whither Claude Lorraine used to come to paint pictures of which the surrounding landscape is still so artistically, so compositionally, suggestive. We went into the inner court, a cloister almost, with the carven capitals of its loggia columns, and looked at a handsome child swinging shyly against the half- opened door of a room whose impenetrable shadow, behind her, made her, as it were, a sketch in bituminous water-colours. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the farmer, a handsome, pale, fever-tainted fellow with a well-to-do air that didn't in the least deter his affability from a turn compatible with the acceptance of small coin; and then we galloped away and away over the meadows which stretch with hardly a break to Veii. The day was strangely delicious, with a cool grey sky and just a touch of moisture in the air stirred by our rapid motion. The Campagna, in the colourless even light, was more solemn and romantic than ever; and a ragged shepherd, driving a meagre straggling flock, whom we stopped to ask our way of, was a perfect type of pastoral, weather-beaten misery. He was precisely the shepherd for the foreground of a scratchy etching. There were faint odours of spring in the air, and the grass here and there was streaked with great patches of daisies; but it was spring with a foreknowledge of autumn, a day to be enjoyed with a substrain of sadness, the foreboding of regret, a day somehow to make one feel as if one had seen and felt a great deal--quite, as I say, like a heros de roman. Touching such characters, it was the illustrious Pelham, I think, who, on being asked if he rode, replied that he left those violent exercises to the ladies. But under such a sky, in such an air, over acres of daisied turf, a long, long gallop is certainly a supersubtle joy. The elastic bound of your horse is the poetry of motion; and if you are so happy as to add to it not the prose of companionship riding comes almost to affect you as a spiritual exercise. My gallop, at any rate," [...] said my friend, [...] "threw me into a mood which gave an extraordinary zest {{to the rest of the}} day." [...] He was to go to a dinner-party at a villa on the edge of Rome, and Madam X--, who was also going, called for him in her carriage. [...] "It was a long drive," [...] he went on, [...] "through the Forum, past the Colosseum. She told me a long story about a most interesting person. Toward the end my eyes caught through the carriage window a slab of rugged sculptures. We were passing under the Arch of Constantine. In the hall pavement of the villa is a rare antique mosaic--one of the largest and most perfect; the ladies on their way to the drawing- room trail over it the flounces of Worth. We drove home late, and there's my day." ...|$|E
