5|$|At Dark Springs High School, in Renz's office, Destiny {{talks with}} him and decides he is the Restorer. She asks him if he will help her and her twin. He says that he <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> {{take care of her}} at the senior overnight. Back at her house, Destiny greets her friend Nakeisha Johnson, who tells her Renz was left out of the camp {{yearbook}} and there are no photos of him. From this, Destiny determines that Renz is actually a vampire and not the Restorer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{tries to help}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{understand}} how diabetes affects him after Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) told Tracy that he is at risk of getting diabetes. Kenneth tells him a story of how a wicked witch <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> take him away {{if he continues to}} consume his unhealthy eating habits but Tracy does not believe him. Tracy gets disgusted when Kenneth tries to scare him by dressing as a witch but suddenly Jenna comes running in screaming and looking like a witch complete with a broomstick in hand. This scares both Kenneth and Tracy who fearfully vows to change his eating habits immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Kind of Blue musicians {{appeared}} {{together in}} further recorded ventures through the 1960s. Davis {{had made a}} rare post-1953 sideman appearance in 1958 on Adderley's Somethin' Else album; Evans and Adderley collaborated on the latter's LP Know What I Mean? from 1961. Kelly and Chambers backed Hank Mobley on Soul Station in 1960, and Evans and Chambers played on the sessions for The Blues and the Abstract Truth by Oliver Nelson in 1961. The rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb backed Coltrane for Coltrane Jazz and one track on his landmark Giant Steps, which featured Chambers throughout. That trio stayed with Davis for the recordings Someday My Prince <b>Will</b> <b>Come</b> <b>and</b> the live sets at the Blackhawk and at Carnegie Hall.|$|E

5|$|Whisked {{away from}} her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The {{attempted}} elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and round the corner before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up {{to a place of}} business and Hal, who is walking by, attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal turns and sees the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get a photo of the father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> claim her the following day, disguised as her father.|$|E

25|$|The opening quatrain {{begins with}} the {{personification}} of time, a destroyer of great things built by man, a force man cannot equal. The second quatrain portrays a victorless struggle between {{the sea and the}} land. In the last quatrain the speaker applies these lessons to his own situation, realizing that death is inevitable and time <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> take his love away. The concluding couplet, in contrast to Shakespeare's typical practice, provides no solution, no clever twist; only inevitable tears.|$|E
25|$|This amazingly gruesome predatory {{behavior}} {{is a great}} example of a collaboration between solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act alone in her predation, but after that other ants <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates how much more effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant {{would never be able to}} kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as if he thought life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature {{of the universe is}} needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks for happiness in progress, and dreams of a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All alike are empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana.|$|E

500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily {{said that she would}} visit if she could leave [...] "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E
500|$|Before Chamberlain, {{the most}} {{dominant}} big man in the NBA was [...] George Mikan. In November 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball for {{minutes at a time}} without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers' Mikan. The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game, and won 19–18. NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] In the , teams averaged just above 80 points per game. The NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954, and league scoring and attendance increased. By the , teams were averaging 119points each game. Chamberlain that season was one of 37black players in the league, the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950. With their emergence, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black, and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team. Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating. Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that [...] "the attitude [...] was, in my opinion, ' is a freak who <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go. There will never be a black guy doing this again.'" [...] Chamberlain, nicknamed Dipper, was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks, nicknamed the Dipper Dunk. Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship, and their occurrence was rare. As the league's second tallest player, Chamberlain began dunking more regularly. He was still more of a finesse player, preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls. He rarely dunked forcefully. Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain {{did not want to be}} perceived as great merely from being tall.|$|E
500|$|Richard Scudamore {{defended the}} plan as {{consolidating}} the Premier League's global reputation, saying [...] "if we didn't do it, another sport <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> {{do it to}} us". Scudamore said that the chairmen of all 20 Premier League clubs supported the proposal, and disputed claims by the Daily Mail that Randy Lerner of Aston Villa and Dave Whelan of Wigan Athletic were opposed. David Gold, chairman of Birmingham City, endorsed the plan {{in part because the}} larger clubs have in any case already been exploiting foreign markets, with pre-season and even mid-season tours; Game 39 would distribute its revenue among all the clubs. [...] On 15 February, Liverpool F.C. chief executive Rick Parry stated that the proposal had [...] "never been on Liverpool's club agenda" [...] and acknowledged the concern of the club's fans and manager. [...] Paul Hayward, writing in The Guardian, said that the proposal would destroy the balance of the home-and-away round-robin league. The Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) condemned the proposal as being motivated by money, and dubbed it Gam£39. [...] It launched a petition, {{with the support of the}} Daily Mail, to oppose the [...] "outrageous desecration of the national game". In March 2008, the campaign was ended as the FSF declared the proposal [...] "effectively dead". [...] Many die-hard fans who pride themselves on travelling to all their teams' away matches would have been unable to travel abroad for [...] "Game 39". [...] On the other hand, exotic foreign venues would potentially be more appealing destinations for fans than a mundane English city. [...] Managers of Premier League clubs reported to be opposed to or sceptical of the plans included Steve Bruce, Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate, and Rafael Benítez. [...] Alex Ferguson criticised the club owners for lack of consultation with managers. [...] Arsène Wenger, Roy Keane, Kevin Keegan, and Avram Grant supported the proposal. [...] 'Game 39' was also defended as a move to head off plans for a World League involving only elite clubs such as those formerly in the G-14 group.|$|E

2500|$|The Didache {{comments}} 'Not {{the resurrection}} of everyone, but, as it says, [...] "The Lord <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> all his holy ones with him" [...] (16.7) Many Evangelicals believe in a universal resurrection, but divided into two separate resurrections; at the Second Coming and then again at the Great White Throne.|$|E
2500|$|Fredriksen {{sees the}} Fourth Gospel's unique {{explanation}} for Jesus' arrest and crucifixion {{as the most}} historically plausible: [...] "The priests' motivation is clear and commonsensical: 'If we let [...] go on.. the Romans <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> destroy both our holy place and our nation.' Caiaphas continues, 'It is expedient that one man should die for the people, that the whole nation not perish' (John 11:48,50).|$|E
2500|$|Indigenous {{cultures}} {{also use}} instructional ribbing— a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior— in their stories.

The caregiver will often say, [...] "The owl <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> stick you in his ears if you don't stop crying!" [...] Thus, this form of teasing serves {{as a tool to}} correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.|$|E
