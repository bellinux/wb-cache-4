5|$|The {{key players}} {{that formed the}} first eleven of 1953–54 were: Ray King (goalkeeper); Reg Potts and Stan Turner (full-backs); Tommy Cheadle, Albert Leake, Roy Sproson (half-backs); Colin Askey, John Cunliffe, Ken Griffiths, Basil Hayward, and Albert Mullard (forwards); Derek Tomkinson (reserve forward). Their {{achievements}} came as a team, without any outstanding stars, which caused The Sentinel to remark that the <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> were stars.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's group {{opponents in}} Italia '90 were England, Egypt and the Netherlands. Charlton felt that England's four-man midfield of Waddle, Barnes, Bryan Robson and Paul Gascoigne {{did not offer}} enough {{protection}} to the back four, and he was proved correct when Kevin Sheedy cancelled out Gary Lineker's opener to secure a 1–1 draw in the group opener at the Stadio Sant'Elia. A poor performance against a negative Egyptian side at the Stadio La Favorita meant that neither side scored a goal in a dour draw. They ended the group with a 1–1 draw with the Dutch, Niall Quinn cancelling out Ruud Gullit's opener in the 71st minute, after which both sides settled for a stalemate as a draw meant that both qualified ahead of Egypt. Ireland then defeated Romania in the Second Round match at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris which went to penalties after a 0–0 draw, before the <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> had a meeting Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Ireland eventually {{went out to the}} hosts, Italy, 1–0 in the quarter-finals at the Stadio Olimpico. A lapse of concentration meant that Italy's Salvatore Schillaci scored on 38 minutes, and Ireland failed to build up enough chances to find the equalising goal. After returning to Dublin over 500,000 people turned out to welcome the team back.|$|E

25|$|Each {{team can}} field six players {{at a time}} on the court, one player being a goalkeeper.

The team is also allowed to change players any time in the game, usually they change the <b>whole</b> <b>team.</b> Individual substitution happens sometimes, but it usually happens when a player is exhausted or is hurt.|$|E

Although Keegan joined Saints' next pre–season tour, he had already decided to move on to seek a new challenge, and a few days before the start of the 1982–83 season he signed for Second Division Newcastle United for a fee of £100,000.|$|E

25|$|Luton's first {{achievement}} was perhaps {{to become the}} first professional club in the south of England, at a time when professionalism was mainly restricted to the north. On 15 December 1890, a salary of five shillings per week was offered to three players: Frank Whitby, Harry Whitby and Tom Read. Frank Whitby was the first to sign and thus became the first professional footballer in the south. In August 1891 it was decided to pay the <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> two shillings and sixpence per week, plus expenses. Woolwich Arsenal became the second professional club in southern England a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the weather improved, but {{thoughts}} of attempting the summit were quickly abandoned when Art Gilkey collapsed just outside his tent. Houston diagnosed him as suffering from thrombophlebitis - blood clots which would be dangerous at sea level, but would almost certainly be fatal at 7800m. The <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> was now forced into {{a desperate attempt to}} save him. While they believed that there was little or no chance of saving him, the possibility of abandoning him was never discussed. However, the unacceptable avalanche risk followed by a renewal of the storm prevented a descent at that time, and the team remained at Camp VIII for several more days {{in the hope that the}} weather would improve.|$|E

Gautham is brutally dragged onto the floor by a Russian police officer the next day morning, and the reason is that Anna is murdered on her sofa.|$|E

However, the weather had been gradually deteriorating for several days, and soon a severe storm broke. At first it did not dispirit the team, and a secret ballot was held to decide which climbers should make the first summit attempt. However, as the storm continued for day after day their position became more serious. One of the tents collapsed on the fourth night, forcing Houston and Bell to crowd into other, already cramped tents. On August the 6th, with weather forecasts offering little hope of improvement, the party for the first time discussed retreating.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{had used}} dogs {{on his first}} (Discovery) {{expedition}} and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow {{with the use of}} dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.|$|E

Yet Hartopp remained a singularly unsuccessful cricketer, usually batting at the tail-end and bowling only twice in his career, and his career batting average over 69 first-class matches is just 4.25. His highest score in 120 first-class innings was 22, made {{in one of his}} occasional forays {{to the top of the}} batting order in an MCC match against Oxford University in 1846 in which the <b>whole</b> <b>team</b> had been dismissed for 24 in the first innings. From 1853 to 1857, he played in only one match per season, with none at all in 1855; in those four games, he batted seven times, and a score of 2 in his final innings in 1857 ended a succession of six ducks.|$|E
