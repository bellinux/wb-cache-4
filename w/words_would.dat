5|$|Among the Betsimisaraka, like {{several other}} Malagasy ethnic groups, {{there is a}} fady against {{speaking}} {{the name of a}} chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden <b>words</b> <b>would</b> be harshly punished or in some instances executed.|$|E

If the guest {{predicted that the}} <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be guessed, he or she earned $10 for each of six chances remaining. Predicting the <b>word</b> <b>would</b> not be guessed earned $10 for each wrong guess. On the last of six statements, each panelist took only one guess with the first letter revealed and a correct prediction earned $20 per incorrect guess or chance remaining, depending on the guest's prediction.|$|R

In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung <b>words</b> <b>would</b> not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|The war of <b>words</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions {{were on the}} brink of civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E

25|$|Multiple-word {{descriptive}} identifiers with embedded spaces such as {{end of file}} or char table {{cannot be}} used in most programming languages because the spaces between the <b>words</b> <b>would</b> be parsed as delimiters between tokens. The alternative of running the words together as in endoffile or chartable is difficult to understand and possibly misleading; for example, chartable is an English word (able to be charted).|$|E

Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss {{of billions of dollars in}} assets.|$|E
25|$|If a {{word came}} from a {{language}} using the Latin script, they are only respelled if they have become an integral, widely known part of Hungarian language (e.g. laser > lézer, manager > menedzser). If they are less widely used they retain their original spelling, e.g. bestseller, myocarditis, rinascimento. There is no hard and consistent rule and many widely used terms are written in the original spelling, e.g. musical or show. Certain Phrases from foreign languages are always written in their original form, even if the individual <b>words</b> <b>would</b> be respelled in isolation, e.g. tuberkulózis cf. tuberculosis bronchialis.|$|E

50|$|In {{an ideal}} phonemic orthography, {{there would be}} a {{complete}} one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the graphemes (letters) and the phonemes of the language, and each phoneme would invariably be represented by its corresponding grapheme. So the spelling of a <b>word</b> <b>would</b> unambiguously and transparently indicate its pronunciation, and conversely, a speaker knowing the pronunciation of a <b>word</b> <b>would</b> be able to infer its spelling without any doubt. That ideal situation is rare but exists in a few languages.|$|R

25|$|Spreading activation, {{a process}} where similar {{concepts}} are activated when their neighbors are activated, {{is a widely}} accepted model of lexical access. It {{has been shown in}} both bilingual and monolingual individuals, with bilinguals showing activation in both languages during language research tasks. Multiple studies have shown that bilinguals recognize cognate words more quickly than non-cognate words, especially identical cognates, which produce the strongest effect. These effects occurred even when the participants knew ahead of time what language the target <b>words</b> <b>would</b> be in. Despite the specific language contexts, both languages are activated, showing that lexical access is not language-specific and that top-down processing is important in lexical access. Findings suggest that the amount of activation that occurred cross-linguistically was related to the similarity between the translation equivalents of the languages.|$|E
25|$|Numerous fady {{surround}} the Bara nobles. Among the Zafimanely royal clan, for example, it is forbidden to ever kill a relative, even {{as punishment for}} a serious crime. Historically it was taboo {{to speak to the}} wives of chiefs or enter their houses, and there were specific locations restricted to everyone but them for gathering firewood and collecting water. A particularly strong taboo forbade speaking the name of a chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use, and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden <b>words</b> <b>would</b> harshly punished or in some instances executed.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} various {{differences}} between the spoken Chinese varieties, such as Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien, such as variations in vocabulary and grammatical particles, meaning that Vernacular Chinese is less suited for writing texts spoken in Hokkien. Various expressions in Hokkien, as with other Chinese varieties, do not have associated Chinese characters in Vernacular Chinese, meaning that some words originally could not be written. In the case of Cantonese, a vernacular system specifically for writing Cantonese was developed in Hong Kong, then a British colony. On the other hand, since Hokkien was never standardized, different people began to use various separate methods to solve the issue of Hokkien-specific words, where such <b>words</b> <b>would</b> eventually be written using either a Latin-based script, phonetically using bopomofo, or {{through the use of}} a Chinese character chosen phonetically with no relation to the original word via meaning.|$|E

25|$|By fall 1984, The Edge of Night {{aired on}} only 106 of ABC's 213 {{affiliate}} stations. A further two dozen affiliates planned {{to drop the}} series {{in the first quarter}} of 1985, with many station managers doing so because they wanted local programming to air in the 4 o'clock hour. Although ABC intended to continue The Edge of Night, even by offering to move it to a mid-morning timeslot, Procter & Gamble could no longer afford to continue producing the show due to the constant loss of revenue from frequent pre-emptions. Thus, on October 26, 1984, ABC and Procter and Gamble made a joint announcement that the final telecast of Edge of Night (whose title had been shortened to three <b>words)</b> <b>would</b> be on December 28 of that year. At this point, the show's ratings were less than half of what they had been at the beginning of the decade; it finished the 1984-1985 television season last in the daytime ratings race with a 2.6 rating in only four months of episodes.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few <b>words</b> <b>would</b> be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
25|$|Semantic memory {{disorders}} {{fall into}} two groups. Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to four factors. Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and semantic relatedness are the four factors used to differentiate between semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders. A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions. Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. Response consistency is the next factor. In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, you do not see an inconsistent response to specific items like you do in refractory access disorders. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests semantic relatedness. 'Close' groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category. For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping. 'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences. Non-related <b>words</b> <b>would</b> fall into this group. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect. This is not observed in semantic storage disorders. Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.|$|E
