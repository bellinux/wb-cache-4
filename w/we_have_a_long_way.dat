2500|$|Following her tour in Europe, Madonna {{returned}} to the United States to perform. [...] Madonna urged her U.S. fans to appreciate their {{freedom of speech and}} claimed, [...] "I've seen some scary things. I've seen people being locked up and put in jail for speaking their minds, for being gay, for not practicing the right religion, for not dressing the proper way. Yeah, it's scary. But what it made me realize is how lucky I am to be living here in America. It doesn't mean that this is the perfect country. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> {{still to}} go. Kindly walk {{clear of the}} path. Now let us follow the trail. I fear {{that it will not}} lead very far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, uncle," [...] she said, {{getting up}} and looking round, [...] "it is time that we should go now; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go, you know. Where is the boat?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{would like}} to have heard more, but time was {{pressing}} on and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next day," [...] he began, {{without any}} emotion in his voice, [...] "she felt stronger, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk. She told me everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Row steadily, Ruthven," [...] he shouted; [...] "don't spurt. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> row {{before us}} and must not knock {{ourselves}} {{up at the}} beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "I {{have come}} a long way tonight," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before we shall be out of danger. Come; I shall tell you all about as we go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you insist}} on it, I'm agreed. But do put your pipe out, Tom, and let us resume our march, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go, and much work to do before {{reaching}} the camp to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sit {{firmly in}} the saddle, my lord, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go and no time to waste,' said the brown horse, and Petru soon {{saw that they were}} riding as no man and horse had ever ridden before.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Ned answered; [...] "I will go {{fast for}} a bit, {{but you must}} not knock yourselves up; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{met them}} with a grave smile. [...] "You are prompt. I am glad to see you, Leo, and you, too, Mrs. Post. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> watch before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And it's not as {{if there}} had been any doubt about our knowing our minds. We both cared, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before us. We could afford to wait.' ...|$|R
60|$|At this opportune moment, {{the cards}} were thrown up, and Mr Henry Gowan {{came across the}} room saying, 'Mother, if you can spare Mr Clennam for this time, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go, and it's getting late.' Mr Clennam thereupon rose, as {{he had no choice}} but to do; and Mrs Gowan showed him, to the last, the same look and the same tapped contemptuous lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{good enough}} at times," [...] the man replied; [...] "but the ducks are not here all the year. The long-legged birds are always to be found here in numbers, but the ducks are uncertain, so are the geese. At certain times in the year they leave us altogether. Some say they go across the Great Sea to the north; others that they go far south into Nubia. Then {{even when they are}} here they are uncertain. Sometimes they are thick here, then again there is scarce one to be seen, and we hear they are {{swarming}} on the lakes further to the west. Of course the wading birds are of no use for food; so you see when the ducks and geese are scarce, we have a hard time of it. Then, again, even when we have got a boat-load <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to take it to market, and when the weather is hot all may get spoiled before we can sell them; and the price is so low in these parts when the flocks are here {{that it is hard to}} lay by enough money to keep us and our families during the slack time. If the great cities Thebes and Memphis lay near to us, it would be different. They could consume all we could catch, and we should get better prices, but unless under very favorable circumstances there is no hope of the fowl keeping good during the long passage up the river to Thebes. In fact, were it not for our decoys we should starve. In these, of course, we take them alive, and send them in baskets to Thebes, and in that way get a fair price for them." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{reflecting}} on Green for All's first year, Jones wrote, [...] "One year later, Green for All is real - {{and we have}} helped put green collar jobs on the map... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go. But today {{we have a strong}} organization to help get us there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady, Jessie, steady. You {{have been}} brave and quiet, coming down. The danger is over now, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk and <b>a</b> longer ride before us, {{and you will}} need all your strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> story," [...] {{answered}} the King, with a Winged laugh; [...] "but as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey before us, I will {{pass the time}} by telling you about it, if you wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This attempt has failed; but I shall {{try again}} and again until I succeed, {{providing}} {{we get out of}} this scrape alive, which is by no means certain, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and perilous journey before us." ...|$|R
5000|$|NCIRD {{director}} Schuchat {{has indicated}} {{a willingness to}} expand immunization surveillance and enforce vaccination schedule compliance, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go with adolescent immunization programs, as well as adult programs...There are so many opportunities for health impact in this group, and the new vaccines really offer us this whole new chance to revitalize health care for adolescents and prevention as an adolescent health issue." [...] Incorporating new vaccines into routine practice is a big priority for the NCIRD under Dr. Shuchat's leadership.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 19, {{she made}} her first major speech in Chicago, and stated that [...] "We've come a long way. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go." [...] In early 1983, King gave a speech at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. Many members of the {{audience}} said that she reminded them of her father. King attended Grinnell College in Iowa, and graduated from Spelman College, a historically black college in Atlanta, with a degree in psychology. King says she had thoughts of suicide before [...] "God intervened." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{has been}} foolish," [...] she answered; [...] "I know that He {{has told me}} everything. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk this morning; the poor fellow threw himself upon my charity. He has signed notes to a large amount." ...|$|R
60|$|The Captain rode {{over several}} times to see us; and Miss Brough seemed always delighted to see him. One day I met him as I was walking out alone by the river, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. The fact is, I {{lost sight}} of Peterkin when I left Oxford--and since that time {{he seems to have}} drifted into difficulties. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk. He is living here, he tells me, until his affairs are settled." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an 1957 article, Dr. Whitlock, {{director}} of Health Education in the National Dairy Council, Chicago, Illinois, discussed {{the impact of}} strontium-90 in the cow milk consumed by humans, concluding {{that the effects of}} Sr-90 would not be detectably harmful to the general populace of the USA. [...] "From the foregoing information, it would seem <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before the presence of Strontium-90 in milk and other foods can catch up with the amounts of radioactivity to which we have long been exposed through natural resources." [...] Specifically referring to the natural radioactivity one is exposed to from potassium-40." ...|$|E
5000|$|Peter Tatchell {{spoke about}} the aims of media visibility: [...] "The Russian media has been full of reports about gay issues for the last week. This has hugely {{increased}} public awareness and understanding of gay people. Slowly, we are eroding homophobic attitudes. Through this media visibility, we are helping to normalise queer existence. After our successive gay protests in Moscow since 2006, people are less shocked about homosexuality. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go, but gradually we are winning hearts and minds, especially among younger Russians. (...) The same has been true all throughout history. It has been direct action by radical campaigners like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King that has most dramatically and effectively overturned injustice. By adapting their tactics, the Slavic Pride coordinators ran rings around the Russian and Moscow authorities {{and put them on}} the defensive. (...) All in all, it was a PR disaster for the Russian and Moscow authorities, ensuring that Eurovision 2009 will be forever associated with police brutality, government homophobia and the suppression of a peaceful protest." ...|$|E
5000|$|Narayan {{returned}} to prominence in State {{politics in the}} late 1960s. 1974 ushered in a year of high inflation, unemployment and lack of supplies and essential commodities. Nav Nirman Andolan movement of Gujarat asked Jayaprakash to lead a peaceful agitation. On 8 April 1974, aged 72, he led a silent procession at Patna. The procession was lathi charged. On 5 June 1974, Jayaprakash addressed a large crowd at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. He declared, [...] "This is a revolution, friends! We are not here merely to see the Vidhan Sabha dissolved. That is only one milestone on our journey. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go... After 27 years of freedom, {{people of this country}} are wracked by hunger, rising prices, corruption... oppressed by every kind of injustice... it is a Total Revolution we want, nothing less!" [...] In 1974, he led the students' movement in the state of Bihar which gradually developed into a popular people's movement known as the Bihar Movement. It was during this movement that JP gave a call for peaceful Total Revolution. Together with V. M. Tarkunde, he found the Citizens for Democracy in 1974 and the People's Union for Civil Liberties in 1976, both NGOs, to uphold and defend civil liberties.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk in <b>a</b> sweltering hot day. Met Mr. Blackwood {{coming to}} call, and walked him on with us, so blinked his visit--gratias, domine!! Asked him for breakfast to-morrow to make amends. I rather over-walked myself--the heat considered.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] the seneschal said heartily. [...] "I {{shall be}} glad {{to talk to you}} again, sir; but at present, madame, it is time to mount. The troops are mustering, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ride before us.|$|R

40|$|A parochial {{review is}} {{presented}} concerning {{the status of}} our understanding of hot gas regions in the Galaxy and their implications for the overall distributions of the Galaxy's gaseous components. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go, and for signi cant progress need the kind of tool improvements highlighted by this conference...|$|E
30|$|The above report {{provides}} {{further evidence}} of the growth of genomic-based personalised medicine (NEJM 358 : 1061, 2008). Nevertheless, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before we are confident of this approach in pharmaco-therapeutics. We need more information {{on the extent to which}} genetic polymorphisms influence warfarin sensitivity, supported by clinical trials to test whether treatment guided by genotyping is any safer and/or more effective than traditional strategies.|$|E
40|$|There was a {{considerable}} amount of tillage activity during fall 2001 {{in different parts of the}} state, which suggests that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go in adopting conservation tillage practices. In 1999, a survey of 340 corn and soybean producers in 19 Iowa counties was conducted by the Iowa Resources Management Partnership, established in 1999 as an informal partnership of private and public organizations promoting and addressing issues related to conservation tillage in Iowa...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the change}} in guitarists, Courtney has said, [...] "Removing Matt from the band {{definitely}} changes the equation, but I'm pretty sure I met Julian {{on the same day}} I met Matt Mondanile.
