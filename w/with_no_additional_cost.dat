At its inception, UNAVCO was housed within the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado-Boulder. In 1992, UNAVCO moved under the umbrella of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), also located in Boulder, Colorado. In 2001, UNAVCO, Inc. incorporated as an independent, non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation. For a one-year period, between April 2001 and September 2003, UCAR/UNAVCO and UNAVCO, Inc. both existed. In October 2003, funding for UCAR/UNAVCO ended and the staff and equipment of UCAR/UNAVCO moved to UNAVCO, Inc. The objective of this change was to provide the UNAVCO community with control over UNAVCO resources and activities <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> to the community. UNAVCO, Inc. adopted the former acronym as its official name when it incorporated, though currently the acronym does not specifically stand for anything.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is described using chitosan-genipin films as a sustainable method for wine preservation. Films prepared from fungi and from shrimp by-products showed similar mechanical and chemical properties. In addition, shrimp derived films showed no IgE positive reaction against shellfish allergenic compounds. The chitosan-genipin films {{were used to}} produce white wines without the addition of sulphur dioxide as a preservative. These wines showed lower susceptibility to browning, with organoleptic characteristics comparable to those prepared using sulphur dioxide. It is shown that the formation of iron-tartrate-chitosan complexes promotes the decrease of iron and other metal availability, minimizing oxidation reactions, as well as inhibiting microbial growth. The overall volatile character of the wines was maintained. However, the presence of chitosan-genipin films promotes the occurrence of Maillard and Strecker reactions, producing volatile compounds with positive wine aroma scents. The use of chitosan-genipin films in winemaking is an innovative, green and environmentally friendly technology that could be easily implemented at an industrial scale <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates a distributed {{mechanism for the}} contention control in IEEE 802. 11 Wireless LANs. Specifically, our mechanism named Asymptotically Optimal Backoff (AOB), dynamically adapts the backoff window size to the current load. AOB guarantees that an IEEE 802. 11 WLAN asymptotically (i. e. for {{a large number of}} active stations) achieves its optimal channel utilization. The proposed mechanism merges the ideas on adaptive backoff presented in [2] with some properties derived from the IEEE 802. 11 capacity analysis (see [3]). AOB can be used on top of the standard 802. 11 access mechanism without requiring any modification to the standard or additional hardware. The AOB mechanism adapts the backoff to the network contention level by using two simple load estimates: the slot utilization and the average size of transmitted frames. These estimates are simple and can be obtained <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>costs</b> or overheads. The performance of the IEEE 802. 11 protocol with or without the AOB mechanism is investigated in the paper via simulation.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design and the {{performance}} evaluation of a new mechanism, named Distributed Contention Control (DCC), for the adaptive contention reduction in LAN networks that utilize random access MAC protocols. The proposed mechanism could be executed {{on the top of}} a pre-existent access protocol, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> overhead introduced. Specifically, we consider the IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN (WLAN). The DCC mechanism requires a simple and rough estimate of the contention level, and this can be achieved by estimating any parameter, directly connected with the amount of contention on the shared channel. The main characteristics of the proposed mechanism are represented by its simplicity, integration with the Standard, complete distribution, absence of overheads, and prompt reaction to changes in the network congestion. The protocol automatically adapts to the network congestion, by monitoring the channel contention level, through the estimation of the contention parameter.
