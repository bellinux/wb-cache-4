Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed.

5|$|Years {{later in}} 1967, Red Sox pitcher Billy Rohr came {{within a single}} strike of a no-hitter at Yankee Stadium. Elston Howard hit a two-out, two-strike single in the ninth to break the no-hit bid. Rohr {{completed}} the one-hitter, but ultimately finished his career with only two wins, both coming against the Yankees. Later that year, Red Sox third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam during {{the first game of}} a two-game series. In the second game, Yankee pitcher Thad Tillotson threw two brushback pitches at Foy before beaning him in the batting helmet. In the next inning, Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg beaned Tillotson. Both pitchers yelled at each other, and then a brawl ensued. During the fight, Red Sox outfielder Reggie Smith picked up and body-slammed Tillotson to the ground. Just two months later, both teams were involved in the longest game ever played (by innings) at Yankee Stadium. New York recorded a 20-inning, 4–3 victory over Boston. Earlier that year on August 3, the Yankees traded Howard, the first African-American player in franchise history, to the Red Sox to help bolster their team during the pennant race. When Howard returned to Yankee Stadium in a Red Sox uniform, the Yankee fans gave him a standing ovation. Boston would be led by Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski's historic season winning the batting triple crown, leading the Red Sox to the pennant in what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> year for the Sox. Howard's contribution would be instrumental in the 1967 World Series, but he and Yastrzemski would lose to Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals four games to three.|$|E

25|$|At Roadblock: End of the Line, Charlotte Flair {{defeated}} Sasha Banks to win {{her record}} fourth Raw Women's Championship, ending their long feud and, as per a post-event stipulation, {{as long as one}} of them were champion, the other could not challenge for the title. Charlotte then began a feud with Bayley, which resulted in a championship match at the Royal Rumble, where Charlotte retained. Also during this time, Sasha entered into a feud with Nia Jax, who defeated Sasha on the Royal Rumble pre-show. The next night on Raw, Bayley pinned Charlotte in a six-person mixed tag team match, thus granting her a rematch for the title on the February 13 episode of Raw, where she defeated Charlotte to become the new Raw Women's Champion, thanks to help from Sasha. The following week, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon asked Bayley to relinquish her title due to Sasha's interference, but Bayley refused and Charlotte invoked her championship rematch for Fastlane, which saw Bayley retain after Sasha, who had just defeated Jax, again interfered, which subsequently ended Charlotte's undefeated streak in singles matches at pay-per-view events. The following night on Raw, Sasha said that she and Bayley should face off for the title at WrestleMania 33 as it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of theirs to face each other at the event. Charlotte came out and demanded that she should have a rematch due to Sasha's interference and said that Sasha interfered due to the Roadblock stipulation. Raw General Manager Mick Foley then scheduled Charlotte to face Sasha in which the winner would challenge Bayley for the title at WrestleMania. However, Stephanie decided to keep Charlotte in the championship match at WrestleMania, but allowed Sasha the opportunity {{to be added to the}} match if she could defeat Bayley that night, which she did. The following week, Sasha defeated Charlotte's ally Dana Brooke, whom Charlotte had ordered to take out Sasha. Charlotte then fired and insulted Dana, who attacked Charlotte in retaliation. Nia Jax was also given the opportunity to challenge for the championship at WrestleMania if she could defeat Bayley. However, Nia lost the match by disqualification as she kept attacking Bayley beyond the referee's five count, but the following week, Nia defeated Bayley in a rematch that was no disqualification, earning her a spot in the championship match at WrestleMania. The following week prior to Raw, the match was turned into a fatal four-way elimination match. On Raw, Bayley and Sasha teamed up and defeated Charlotte and Nia. After the match, Nia laid out her three WrestleMania opponents.|$|E
