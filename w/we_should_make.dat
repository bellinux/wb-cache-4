25|$|Its name {{initially}} was 'Parallels Workstation for Mac OS X', which {{was consistent with}} the company's corresponding Linux and Windows products. This name was not well received within the Mac community, where some felt that the name, particularly the term “workstation,” evoked the aesthetics of a Windows product. Parallels agreed: “Since we've got a great Mac product, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> it look and sound like a Mac product...”, it was therefore renamed ‘Parallels Desktop for Mac’.|$|E

So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make.</b> It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Frank {{authored}} the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act (H.R. 2592), {{an attempt}} to stop the federal government from preempting states' medical marijuana laws. He has consistently voted for the bipartisan Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment, annually proposed by Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), that would prohibit the United States Department of Justice from prosecuting medical marijuana patients. In March 2008, he proposed the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008 (HR 5843), which would have decriminalized small amounts of the drug, but which died in committee during the 110th Congress. [...] On June 18, 2009, he re-introduced the bill as the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2009 (HR 2943). Commenting on legislation to remove federal criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, Frank stated [...] "In a free society a large degree of human activity is none of the government's business. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> criminal what's going to hurt other people and other than that we should leave it to people {{to make their own}} choices." [...] In 2003, he was rated [...] "A" [...] by Vote Hemp, indicating a pro-hemp voting record. In 2006 he was rated [...] "+30" [...] by NORML, indicating a pro-drug-reform stance. In 2007 he co-sponsored the [...] "Drug Sentencing Reform & Kingpin Trafficking Act" [...] ((S.1711) 07-S1711) to [...] "target cocaine kingpins and address sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine". In 2008, Frank sponsored [...] "Removing Impediments to Students Education" [...] (RISE) ((H.R.5157) 08-HR5157) to allow rehabilitated drug offenders to get student loans.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reaction from}} newspaper critics. In the Liverpool Echo, Rachael Tinniswood {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "was a fantastic display of everything that has made Cold Feet such a popular drama {{over the past few}} years" [...] and that Kimberley Joseph had proved to be [...] "a more than adequate replacement" [...] for Fay Ripley {{over the course of the}} fourth series. Tony Purnell wrote in the Daily Mirror that [...] "The fact that the gang ended up in Australia showed just how much the series had lost its way." [...] Graham Young in the Birmingham Mail wrote that the excursion to Sydney [...] "smacks more of giving the cast a treat after four years, rather than any real necessity of the script". The Daily Records critic wrote [...] "if this is the last-ever episode, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> the most of what has been a relatively disappointing series". In a column about Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the episode—"which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot"—of being the point the series jumped the shark. Times columnist Caitlin Moran described it as [...] "both draining and tensifying". Moran went on to say that Adam and Rachel had become poorly characterised and suggested that Mike Bullen had come to loathe the characters. The episode was selected as a [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sun and The Sunday Times. Writing in the Journal of British Cinema and Television in 2006, Greg M. Smith analysed the development of the David character over the course of Series 4, including the fantasy scene in this episode where David imagines living with Karen in Australia, and the scene where David and Karen take off their wedding rings: [...] "Old, exhausted love is traded for new, vibrant love in this single gesture. Karen pursues David as he storms off after the ceremony, shouting his name, undoubtedly ready to alternate once more between pain and partial forgiveness, as they have done throughout their marriage. David turns and says: 'No, Karen. No more'." [...] Smith also compared the scene to the wedding scene in the film The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946).|$|E

Club commented [...] "Whether or not he’s right is up to the viewer, but while I’m not sure 'quantum' really enters into it, the episode does make an {{interesting}} case for how the accumulation of events can offer substance even if those events never yield any deeper meaning.

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{argue that}} chimps are unique animals and either {{should not be}} used in research, or should be treated differently. Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the University of California, San Diego, argues, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using chimps should follow the ethical guidelines used for human subjects unable to give consent. Also, a recent study suggests chimpanzees which are retired from labs exhibit a form of posttraumatic stress disorder. Stuart Zola, director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Laboratory, disagrees. He told National Geographic: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species, whether it's a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee. No matter how much we may wish it, chimps are not human." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>make</b> a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw.
