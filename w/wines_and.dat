5|$|The Carménère grape is a {{wine grape}} variety {{originally}} planted in the Médoc region of Bordeaux, France, where {{it was used to}} produce deep red <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> occasionally used for blending purposes {{in the same manner as}} Petit Verdot.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

5|$|The crop {{substitution}} programs successfully {{encouraged the}} cultivation of tea, coffee, corn, and fruit trees, replacing the opium poppies {{that had previously been}} grown. New fruit orchards and tea factories were also set up, followed by production facilities for fruit <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> Chinese herbs, which are particularly popular among Thais and tourists from China, Taiwan, and other ethnic Chinese communities in south-east Asia.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia (which was already an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> olives grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'Hérault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery capitalized on this new horizon, producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette.|$|E
5|$|The winery {{had been}} founded by both {{his father and}} his {{grandfather}}, Hermann Schnaufer, in 1919, shortly after World War I. Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the winery was run by his father alone. When his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over the winery after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to the winery offered wine imports, sparkling <b>wines,</b> <b>and</b> a distillery for wine and liqueur. The distribution channel worked with agents and sales offices throughout Germany.|$|E

5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> fortified wines is very small.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Webster (1813–1872) {{was born}} in Ovenden, a small village about 2 miles from Halifax town centre. He was the eldest of seven {{brothers}} born into a Congregationalist family of the 10acre-owning farmer James Webster. Webster acquired the small Fountain Head Brewery in Ovenden Wood in 1838 when he was 25 and opened an office in Union Cross Yard, Halifax. The company bought its first public house in 1845. In 1860 he was joined in partnership by his three sons Isaac, George Henry and Samuel Green, and the firm began trading as Samuel Webster & Sons. Samuel Webster died in 1872, leaving his sons to continue the business. The firm also imported and sold <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> cigars, {{in addition to its}} brewing concerns.|$|E

5|$|Spalding {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed {{it was part of the}} sea here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish <b>wines,</b> <b>and</b> some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was {{demolished}} {{and replaced by}} a new house in Georgian style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former vaulted undercroft of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of <b>wines</b> <b>and</b> beers. The first floor was the piano nobile, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs {{leading up to the}} main entrance. Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for pleasure boating. Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing. According to the authors of the Buildings of England series, the architect responsible for this was James Wyatt. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and barrel vaulting was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its arcade.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} history of the {{philosophy}} of fondue since Aristotle so as to arrive at the formulation of the paradox of Swiss fondue. Either the <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> the cheese cease to exist (Buridan), but then the fondue is not really a mixture of <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> cheese. Or the <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> the cheese continue to exist. If they do, then either they continue to exist in different places (the chemists), but then a fondue can never be perfectly homogenous (it is a French fondue). Or the <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> the cheese continue to exist in the same place (the Stoïcs), but then <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> cheese have to be, oddly, penetrable and spatially expansible. Aristote attempted to solve this paradox by arguing that the cheese <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> continue to exist, but only potentially in the fondue. We sketch an alternative answer. The <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> the cheese continue to exist, but only non-spatially in the fondue. <b>Wine</b> <b>and</b> cheese, once mixed, become non-spatial constituents of the fondue, a bit like character traits are non-spatial constituents of persons. The <b>wine</b> <b>and</b> the cheese are in the fondue, but only the fondue is there in the fondue pot...|$|R
