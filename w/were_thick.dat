5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves <b>were</b> <b>thick,</b> bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about in the woods.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless-steel rotors <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E

A breasted arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> at the area {{right behind the}} fletchings, and tapers towards the (nock) and head. A bob-tailed arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> right behind the head, and tapers to the nock. A {{barrelled}} arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> in {{the centre of the}} arrow. Target arrows are those arrows used for target shooting rather than warfare or hunting, and usually have simple arrowheads.|$|R

25|$|King-street from Elizabeth-street to Macquarie-street, was thronged, and {{it became}} {{exceedingly}} difficult for the police, who were present in considerable force under Mr. sub-inspector Anderson, to preserve anything like order. Not only was the street thronged, but the balconies and {{the windows of the}} houses opposite the church were filled with sight-seers, the stone wall and railings enclosing the church <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> with people, and even the roof of the Supreme Court gave footing or a precarious support to adventurous individuals who were determined to see all that could be seen of the viceregal wedding. The crushing towards the church gates was enough to endanger life and limb. The persistent efforts made by the crowd to get within the railed enclosure caused the churchwardens to lock the gates, and to refuse, for some time, admittance to anybody, and even the guests specially invited to witness the marriage ceremony were subjected to much inconvenience and delay before they could reach the church doors. This, however, was almost unavoidable, for the crowd and the crushing were such that the severest measures were necessary to prevent the church being rushed by the people.|$|E

500|$|... "More {{popular than}} Jesus" [...] is a remark {{made by the}} Beatles' John Lennon in 1966. During an interview, he argued that Christianity was in decline and {{that it may be}} outlived by rock music, {{explaining}} [...] "We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when it was republished in the United States five months later.|$|E
500|$|In 1858, {{geologist}} Ebenezer Emmons described {{two large}} fossil teeth found in Bladen County, North Carolina. Emmons assigned these teeth to Polyptychodon, which he then {{believed to be}} [...] "a genus of crocodilian reptiles". Later discoveries showed that Polyptychodon was actually a pliosaur, a type of marine reptile. The teeth described by Emmons <b>were</b> <b>thick,</b> slightly curved, and covered with vertically grooved enamel; he assigned them a new species name, P. rugosus. Although not initially recognized as such, these teeth were probably the first Deinosuchus remains to be scientifically described. Another large tooth that likely came from Deinosuchus, discovered in neighboring Sampson County, was named Polydectes biturgidus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869.|$|E
500|$|The skull, {{measuring}} [...] in length, was proportionally {{shorter and}} deeper {{than in any}} other large carnivorous dinosaur. The snout was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like Ceratosaurus, and the jaws were curved upwards. As in other abelisaurids, the facial bones, especially the nasal bones, were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes. In life, a wrinkled and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the frontal bones, <b>were</b> <b>thick,</b> cone-shaped but in cross-section somewhat vertically flattened, and measured [...] in length. In life, they would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns. The proportionally small eyes were situated in {{the upper part of the}} keyhole shaped orbita (eye sockets). The upper part was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of binocular vision.|$|E

500|$|Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region {{above the}} eyes, {{instead of the}} horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses {{extended}} from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an [...] "antorbital buttress". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse sadle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses {{from each other and}} forming a T-shape in top view. These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. They had a concave surface on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} they {{returned}} home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. [...] "Christianity will go," [...] Lennon had said. [...] "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples <b>were</b> <b>thick</b> and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – {{on the eve of the}} group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American [...] "Bible Belt". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, [...] "If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it." [...] Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: [...] "If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry." ...|$|E

[...] It was shaped as a polygon, approximately [...] in length, and two of its sides faced the Rhine. The main wall was approximately [...] high.

[...] The inner spaces included a section of barracks that cold hold up to 1500 men; indeed, in an earlier bombardment in the hostilities in September 1796, the barracks, gun emplacements, and walls had withstood a lengthy Austrian barrage. [...] The fortress had stone and mortar ravelins and each bastion had its own hornwork; the hornwork between the Rhine and the Kinzig was approximately [...] in length. [...] The hornworks themselves were faced with stone and mortar and had their own ravelines, a covered communication ditch, and an earthen glacis.|$|E

500|$|The {{end of the}} Middle Ages saw the {{construction}} of larger, more powerful cannon, as well their spread throughout the world. As they were not effective at breaching the newer fortifications resulting from the development of cannon, siege engines—such as siege towers and trebuchets—became less widely used. However, wooden [...] "battery-towers" [...] took on a similar role as siege towers in the gunpowder age—such as that used at Siege of Kazan in 1552, which could hold ten large-calibre cannon, in addition to 50 lighter pieces. Another notable effect of cannon on warfare during this period was the change in conventional fortifications. Niccolò Machiavelli wrote, [...] "There is no wall, whatever its thickness that artillery will not destroy {{in only a few}} days." [...] Although castles were not immediately made obsolete by cannon, their use and importance on the battlefield rapidly declined. Instead of majestic towers and merlons, the walls of new fortresses <b>were</b> <b>thick,</b> angled, and sloped, while towers became low and stout; increasing use was also made of earth and brick in breastworks and redoubts. These new defences became known as bastion forts, after their characteristic shape which attempted to force any advance towards it directly into the firing line of the guns. A few of these featured cannon batteries, such as the House of Tudor's Device Forts, in England. Bastion forts soon replaced castles in Europe, and, eventually, those in the Americas, as well.|$|E
