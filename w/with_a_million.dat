5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{voluntary}} subscription, {{rather than}} funding from local or central government, {{was considered the}} only correct {{way to pay for}} a war memorial, although it was disputed whether active proactive fundraising was appropriate. Raising the sums required could be quite difficult, and many committees tried various means, including moral blackmail, to exhort larger sums out of the more wealthy members of the community. The amount of money successfully raised varied considerably: the city of Glasgow, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> inhabitants, raised approximately £104,000 for memorials; Leeds, with around half a million inhabitants, only £6,000. A typical memorial monument in Britain costed between £1,000 and £2,000, but some could be cheaper still; larger pieces, such as the Royal Artillery Memorial, could cost as much as £25,000. Australian communities raised funds in similar ways to their British equivalents, but the process of fund-raising was much more open, and included directly canvassing for donations. Typical Australian projects cost between £100 and £1,000, with the larger memorials costing up to £5,000; bank-loans were also sometimes used. Memorials along the Western front, being larger, cost rather more than their civic equivalents; the Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial, for example, cost the IWGC and Australian government around £40,000.|$|E

25|$|The year 1871 however, {{also brought}} {{developments}} which signalled Neafie & Levy's eventual {{departure from the}} front rank of American shipbuilders. In this year, Cramp & Sons built its first marine engine, and henceforth was to purchase no more engines from Neafie & Levy, depriving the latter of a principal customer. Moreover, Cramp constructed a large dry dock which enabled it to enter the lucrative hull repair business. Jacob Neafie did not follow suit, preferring to rely upon his existing business model of building smaller iron vessels and supplying engines to builders of wooden ships. By 1880, although Neafie & Levy was still Philadelphia's most heavily capitalized firm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollars in assets, its return on investment (ROI) was only 7.1% {{compared to that of}} Cramp with an ROI in excess of 15%. Moreover, Cramp's capitalization was not far behind at $750,000, but it employed 2,300 workers compared to Neafie & Levy's 500, and its output was more than 2½ times greater. A substantial part of the difference was due to the Cramp dry dock.|$|E

500|$|Stones Bitter is {{a bitter}} beer first brewed in 1948 at the Cannon Brewery. It was {{designed}} for the steelworkers of Sheffield's Lower Don Valley. Bass extended its distribution to include the north of England in 1977, before extending distribution nationwide in 1979. Its popularity during the 1970s and 1980s in its heartland saw it described as [...] "more of a religion than a beer." [...] By 1992 Stones was the UK's highest selling bitter, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> barrels sold annually. That same year the ABV of Stones was reduced from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV, and then to 3.7 per cent in 1999. The cask conditioned Stones was restored to 4.1 per cent ABV in 2006, before being discontinued in 2012. A famous major television campaign ran nationally from 1983 until 1991 with the tagline [...] "(Wherever you may wander) there's no taste like Stones" [...] and starred Tony Barton and Michael Angelis. By 1987 it had become the UK's longest running bitter campaign of all time.

500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> amplifiers." ...|$|E
500|$|Construction {{continued}} with the issuing of a $6.55million contract (about $ in [...] dollars) to widen a [...] section of I-8 through Alpine, from Harbinson Canyon to east of West Victoria Drive, {{and to begin}} construction in April or May 1967, {{to be completed in}} 1969. This would leave only a [...] stretch of I-8 that was not at freeway standards. As the process continued, concerns about increased smog from the additional traffic were raised in October 1967. A [...] section to the east of Alpine was scheduled to have bidding opened in November of that year, and was to be finished in 1968; this would produce a continuous freeway from San Diego to the eastern terminus of this route. Both of these projects were underway by May 1968. An additional contract was given out for $7.8million (about $ in [...] dollars) in August to continue the freeway east from Alpine Street to Japatul Valley Road; this would bring the freeway near Descanso Junction. Roughly 5.5million cubic yards of dirt and rock were to be generated by all three of these construction projects, since half of a mountain would have to be removed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> pounds of dynamite. The third project was built near the site of an abandoned attempt to build a tunnel for the old highway after World War II, which proved to be too expensive.|$|E

I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing."
