The band had previously scored Berg's 2004 film Friday Night Lights, and Jablonsky had previously scored Battleship. Jablonsky {{said of the}} collaboration, [...] "It was great. I didn't work directly with them because they're in Austin, Texas and I'm in L.A.

Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, [...] "We devised a laser effect where a device {{is going into}} his mouth and some other weird lens effects that were going over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality." [...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, very scary. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E

[...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have {{questioned}} the character's sexuality {{since the end of}} the series. Curve magazine speculated that Yar was a [...] "closeted" [...] lesbian. In the book Science Fiction Audiences: Watching Doctor Who and Star Trek, the authors describe her as [...] "an obvious bisexual", but that [...] "she should be a lesbian". Referring to the events in [...] "The Naked Now", the authors explain [...] "when they decided to straighten her, they used an android. So <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> heterosexualizing two perfectly wonderful characters". The authors of the book Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos also thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most androgynous characters in the show.|$|E
500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E

[...] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused {{on a group of}} Ivy League graduates socializing in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was [...] "beautifully played." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that [...] "compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn't." [...] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award. The film grossed $3million worldwide.|$|E

Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with almost {{a whole other}} album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I {{was listening to the}} last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him".

Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E

Puppeteer Wanda Webb recalls that Thunderbird 6 maintained a high standard in the appearance of its cast, commenting on a shot which depicts Lady Penelope asleep on board Skyship One, [...] "I had placed the sleeping eyelids in Plasticine and made the eye shadow a little too blue. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> re-shooting the whole sequence." [...] One-use puppets appear in what Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivière describes as [...] "a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21": in the opening scene, the characters of the NWAC executives present gaping mouths and teeth, complete with dental fillings, when Brains' plan to design an airship sends them into howls of laughter. The decision to begin the film with a cold open and delay the title sequence and opening credits was one of Century 21's efforts to distinguish Thunderbird 6 from the preceding film.|$|E

The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld II was {{developed}} in nine months. It was originally slated for a February 1993 release, but the date was later moved up to December 1992. The game underwent {{two and a half}} months of playtesting by Origin and Looking Glass employees, and by remote testing firms. According to Church, the testing phase took more time than expected because of complaints from playtesters and the presence of numerous bugs. Church went to Origin's headquarters in Texas during the final stages of development. The team [...] "tried desperately to make Christmas", and the game was completed around December 18. Church compiled the final version on his laptop in Spector's office. However, the game was held back for further playtesting even though it could have shipped on schedule. Church later commented, [...] "here was one bug we couldn't reproduce, and everyone really wanted to go home for Christmas. <b>We</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> taking a few days off, checking it a few more days and using that version anyway." [...] The delay caused the game to miss the holiday season. It was shipped in January 1993.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Wild Night", {{a hybrid of}} R, soul and country music influences, which {{utilizes}} a moderate 4/4 time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song's intro was created, according to Montrose, [...] when [...] "One afternoon I was messing around with {{what is now the}} intro on the record, [...] stopped me and ... said ' ... that thing you just played ... that's the intro, don't forget it'". This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E
500|$|He scored {{twice in}} 30 Conference games {{in his first}} season with Dover, and his {{performance}} earned him international selection, chosen for England's National Game XI {{for the first time in}} March 1999. He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000–01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him, a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999–2000 season as [...] "a year when we had players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team. In all honesty, we weren't far away from having a side good enough to win the division.

However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog."
