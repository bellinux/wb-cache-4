40|$|Exploratory "whisking" is {{a rhythmic}} motor {{activity}} that enables rodents to locate objects {{in their environment}} through physical contact with their mystacial vibrissae. How the nervous system generates this rhythmic movement, and how the resulting movement enables these animals to determine the position of objects remain unknown. There are ethological similarities between whisking and sniffing, which may suggest that these two exploratory activities have related underlying neural control circuits. We discuss the similar dynamics of these two active sensory behaviors, and how they shape their respective sensory inputs. We demonstrate that the motor patterns for these behaviors are coordinated by respiratory centers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventral medulla. Specifically, we identify a region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input to the facial motoneurons to drive coordinated vibrissa protraction, and we show that this region is under direct control of the respiratory patterning circuitry. Because vibrissa-based object localization may require sensory signals of this self-generated movement, we consider <b>the</b> representation of <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brainstem trigeminal sensory nuclei and their respective target thalamic nuclei.

40|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} work have {{demonstrated}} that brain rhythms might constitute clocking mechanisms against which to coordinate sequences of neural firing; such rhythms may be essential to the coding operations performed by the local networks. The sequence of operations underlying a tactile discrimination task <b>in</b> rats requires <b>the</b> animal to integrate two streams of information, those coming from the environment and, from reference memory the rules that dictate the correct response. The current study is a follow up on the work which has described the hippocampal representation of the tactile guided task. We have used a well-established texture discrimination task, in which rats have to associate two stimuli with two different reward locations. We placed microelectrodes in primary somatosensory cortex and the CA 1 region of hippocampus to perform recordings of spiking activity and local field potentials when the animal touched the discriminandum as well as {{when he was in}} a resting state. We also performed recording on an arena <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> animal moved freely and did not perform any task. Earlier work has demonstrated that tactile signals reach the hippocampus during texture discrimination, presumably through the somatosensory cortex. We predicted that neurons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) are entrained to the oscillatory theta rhythm that permeates the hippocampus. Our expectation is that such coherence could serve to increase the reliability of synaptic transmission, linking the acquisition of new sensory information with associative processes. We addressed the following issues: Is the timing of action potentials in S 1 modulated by the ongoing hippocampal theta rhythm? If so, is the occurrence of this modulation aligned <b>in</b> time to <b>the</b> period <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> hippocampus acquires tactile signals? We also predicted that the 10 -Hz whisking that characterizes the acquisition of texture information would be more strongly phase locked to theta rhythm than <b>the</b> <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air that is not accompanied by any explicit tactile task. We speculate that such phase locking could be a means to synchronize sensory and hippocampal processing.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} thalamocortical circuitry in sensory systems is the extensive and highly organized feedback projection from the cortex to thalamic neurons that provide input to it. Intriguingly, many corticothalamic (CT) neurons are weakly responsive to peripheral stimuli, or silent altogether. Here using the whisker-to-barrel system, we examine whether {{the responses of}} CT neurons and their related thalamic neurons are affected by motor cortex, a prominent source of input to deep layers of the somatosensory cortex. Pharmacological facilitation of motor cortex activity produced using focal, microiontophoresis leads to enhanced whisker-evoked firing of topographically aligned layer 6 neurons, including identified CT cells, and of cells in corresponding regions of the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPm barreloids). Together, the findings raise the possibility that cortico-thalamo-cortical circuitry in primary sensory areas is engaged by other functionally related cortical centers, providing a means for context-dependent regulation of information processing within thalamocortical circuits. We investigated how vMCx influence activity in thalamic VPm nucleus in a freely behaving rat. We examine afferent-evoked thalamic activity in animals that are either alert but voluntarily relatively motionless or actively <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air without object contact. Afferent activity is evoked in VPm by means of electrical microstimulation of a single whisker follicle. In some experiments, neural processing in brainstem trigeminal nuclei was either by-passed by means of medial lemniscus stimulation, or altered by pharmacological intervention. We found that sensory responses during voluntary whisker movements, when motor cortex {{is likely to be}} active, are reduced relative to responses that occur during periods of wakeful quiescence. Enhancement of thalamic activity during whisking can be observed, however, when signal processing in sub-thalamic centers is either by-passed or experimentally altered. Findings suggest that during voluntary movement activity within the lemniscal system is globally diminished, perhaps at early, brainstem levels {{at the same time that}} activity within specific thalamocortical neuronal populations is facilitated. Though activity levels are reduced system-wide, activity within some local circuits may be subject to less net suppression. This decrease in suppression may occur on a moment-to-moment basis in a context-dependent manner. Thus, during voluntary whisker movement, sensory transmission in thalamocortical circuits may be modulated according to specific activation patterns distributed across the motor map...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Motor {{dysfunction}} is a {{major component}} of the Huntington's disease (HD) phenotype, both in patients and animal models. Motor function in mice is usually measured using tests that involve a novel environment, or require a degree of learning, which creates potential confounds in animals, such as anxiety and/or learning. NEW METHOD: We propose that studying whisker control provides a more naturalistic way to measure motor function in HD mice. To this end we tested three strains of HD mice; R 6 / 2 (CAG 250), zQ 175 and Hdh (CAG 50, 150 and 250) mice. RESULTS: We discovered a clear and progressive <b>whisking</b> deficit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most severe model, the R 6 / 2 CAG 250 mouse. At 10 weeks, R 6 / 2 mice showed an increase <b>in</b> <b>whisking</b> movements, which may be a correlate of <b>the</b> hyperkinesia seen <b>in</b> HD patients. By 18 weeks the R 6 / 2 mice showed a reduction <b>in</b> <b>whisking</b> movements. Hdh Q 250 mice showed a hyperkinetic profile at 10 weeks, approximately 4 months before other motor deficits have previously been reported in these mice. Q 175 mice showed very little change <b>in</b> <b>whisking</b> behaviour, apart from a transient increase in retraction velocity at 10 weeks. COMPARISONS WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our findings suggest that whisking may be a more sensitive test of motor function in HD mice than more commonly used methods, such as the rotarod. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that whisking deficits represent a novel way of assessing the progression of the motor phenotype, and are early indicators for reversal of phenotype studies, such as drug trials.

We used exploratory whisking by rat as a model system and recorded two measures: (i) the mystacial electromyogram (∇EMG) as a surrogate of vibrissa position, and (ii) the field potential (∇LFP) in S 1 cortex {{as an indicator of}} electrical activity. The degree to which the ∇EMG and ∇LFP were phase-locked was compared for three categories of rhythmic whisking: (i) searching for an object with the vibrissae for a food reward, (ii) <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> air for <b>the</b> goal of returning to the home cage, and (iii) whisking with no reward. We observed that the magnitude of phase-locking was nearly tripled for the two rewarded conditions compared to unrewarded whisking.

Additional experiments showed that there was no significant relation between the amplitude of a sensory-evoked response in S 1 cortex and the magnitude of the locking between the ∇EMG and the ∇LFP during whisking.

Resonant vibrations also occurred while whisking against textures, but the amplitude of resonance within single whiskers was independent of texture, contradicting the resonance model. Rather, whiskers resonated transiently during discrete, high-velocity, and high-acceleration slip-stick events, which occurred prominently during whisking on surfaces. The rate and magnitude of slip-stick events varied systematically with texture. These results suggest that texture is encoded not by differential resonant motion across whiskers, but by the magnitude and temporal pattern of slip-stick motion.

Previous studies have compellingly demonstrated that rats can accurately determine the horizontal angle at which a vibrissa first touches an object, and we therefore asked whether this parameter could provide the rat with information about the pitch, distance, and yaw of a surface relative to its head. We used a three-dimensional model of the whisker array to construct mappings between the horizontal angle of contact of each vibrissa and every possible (pitch, distance, and yaw) configuration of the head relative to a flat surface. The mappings revealed striking differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patterns of contact for vibrissae in different regions of the array.

Simultaneous movements of whiskers C 1, C 2, and D 1 were tracked bilaterally and their movements compared.

These experimen-tally measured resonant frequencies were matched using a theoretical model of the whisker as a conical cantilever beam, with Young’s modulus as the only free parameter. The best estimate for Young’s modulus was 3 – 4 GPa. Results of both vibration and impulse experiments showed that the whiskers are strongly damped, with damping ratios between 0. 11 and 0. 17. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> behaving animal, whiskers that deflected past an object were observed to resonate but were damped significantly more than isolated whiskers.

The posterior medial nucleus (POm) is the thalamic structure associated with the latter pathway. Previous studies suggested that POm response latencies are positively correlated with stimulation frequency and negatively correlated with response duration, providing a basis for a phase locked loop-temporal decoding of stimulus frequency. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing response latencies of POm neurons, in both awake and anesthetized rats, to vibrissae deflections at frequencies between 0. 3 and 11 Hz. We found no significant, systematic correlation between stimulation frequency and the latency or duration of POm responses.

We recorded from awake, head-restrained rats while monitoring vibrissae movements. All POm neurons responded to passive whisker deflections, but none responded to noncontact whisking. Thus like their counterparts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal ganglion, POm neurons may not reliably encode whisking kinematics. These observations suggest that POm neurons might not faithfully encode vibrissae inputs to provide reliable information on vibrissae movements or contacts...|$|R

40|$|Rats use rhythmic {{movements}} of their vibrissae (whiskers) to tactually explore their environment. This “whisking ” behavior has gener-ally {{been reported to}} be strictly synchronous and symmetric about the snout, and it is thought to be controlled by a brainstem central pattern generator. Because the vibrissae can move independently of the head, however, maintaining a stable perception of the world would seem to require that rats adjust the bilateral symmetry of whiskermovements in response to headmovements. The present study used high-speed videography to reveal dramatic bilateral asymmetries and asynchronies <b>in</b> free-air <b>whisking</b> during head rotations. Kinematic analysis suggested that these asymmetricmovements did not serve tomaintain any fixed temporal relationship between right and left arrays, but rather to redirect the whiskers to a different region of space. More specifically, spatial asymmetry was found to be strongly correlated with rotational head velocity, ensuring a “look-ahead ” distance of almost exactly one <b>whisk.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, bilateral asynchronyandvelocity asymmetrywereonlyweaklydependentonheadvelocity. Bilateral phasedifferencewas found tobe independent of the whisking frequency, suggesting the presence of two distinct left and right central pattern generators, connected as coupled oscillators. We suggest that the spatial asymmetries are analogous to the saccade that occurs during the initial portion of a combined head–eye gaze shift, and we begin to develop the rat vibrissal system as a new model for studying vestibular and proprioceptive contributions to the acquisition of sensory data.

40|$|SummaryThe {{impact of}} social stimuli on the {{membrane}} potential dynamics of barrel cortex neurons is unknown. We obtained in vivo whole-cell recordings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barrel cortex of head-restrained rats while they interacted with conspecifics. Social touch {{was associated with}} a depolarization and large membrane potential fluctuations locked to the rat’s whisking. Both depolarization and membrane potential fluctuations were already observed prior to contact and did not occur during free whisking. This anticipatory pre-contact depolarization was not seen in passive social touch <b>in</b> anesthetized animals. <b>The</b> membrane potential fluctuations locked to <b>the</b> rat’s <b>whisking</b> observed <b>in</b> interactions with awake conspecifics were larger than those seen for whisking onto nonconspecific stimuli (stuffed rats, objects, and the experimenter’s hand). Responses did not correlate with whisker movement parameters. We conclude that responses to social touch differ from conventional tactile responses in (1) amplitude, (2) locking to whisking, and (3) pre-contact membrane potential changes...|$|R

What algorithms incorporate movement as part of perception at the level of cortex?

This is particularly rele-vant for the large repertoire of repetitive behaviors, such as those involved with scanning sensory systems involved with touch, vision, and even olfaction (Diamond et al., 2008; Nelson and MacIver, 2006), in which fast rhythmic motion is modulated by a slowly varying amplitude and/or change in orientation. To ideal cortical region to elucidate multiple timescales in motor control. Past electrophysiological measurements establish that neurons in vM 1 cortex can exert fast control over vibrissa motion. Stimulation of vM 1 cortex in anesthetized animals can elicit either rapid deflections of individual vibrissae (Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003 b; Brecht et al., 2004) or extended whisking bouts that outlast the original stimulation (Cramer and Keller, 2006; Haiss and Schwarz, 2005). Measurement of the local field poten-tial in vM 1 cortex in awake animals indicates that units with rhythmic neural activity can lock to whisking (Ahrens and Klein...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} the electrophysiological properties of vibrissa motoneurones (vMNs) in rat. Intracellular recordings of vMNs in brainstem slices from animals aged P 4 to P 5 and P 9 to P 11, i. e. newborn animals, {{showed that the}} subthreshold membrane impedance has the form of passive decay. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> impedance follows the 1 /√f signature for long dendrites beyond a cut-off frequency of fc= 8 Hz. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> impedance has {{the form of a}} resonant filter in vMNs from slices prepared from animals aged P 17 to P 23, i. e. young animals. The resonance has a peak near 4 Hz and an amplitude of 1. 2 times that at low frequencies (f∼ 0. 1 Hz). The low frequency onset of the resonance is shown to depend on a hyperpolarization-activated depolarizing current, Ih. This current functions as a high-pass filter. The high frequency cut-off of the resonance results from passive decay in long dendrites, similar to the case with newborn animals but with fc= 20 Hz. In addition to a resonance in subthreshold properties, an enhanced resonance in spiking is observed in young as opposed to newborn animals. The transition from solely passive decay in vMNs from newborn animals to resonance in young animals coincides with the onset of whisking. Further, the width of the resonance encompasses the 4 – 15 Hz range of exploratory whisking. Nonetheless, it remains to be shown if there is a causal relation between the regulation of currents <b>in</b> vMNs and <b>the</b> onset of <b>whisking.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we further observed that the membrane impedance of hypoglossal motoneurones from both newborn and young animals exhibits a subthreshold resonance that also peaks near 4 Hz. The amplitude of this resonance increases from 1. 1 to 1. 4 times that at low frequencies in newborn versus young animals. We conjecture that resonance properties in vibrissa, hypoglossal, and potentially other motoneurones, may serve to transiently and purposely synchronize different orofacial behaviours...|$|R
