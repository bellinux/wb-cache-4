5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to <b>wing</b> <b>commander.</b> Finucane became the youngest <b>wing</b> <b>commander</b> in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as <b>wing</b> <b>commander</b> of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
