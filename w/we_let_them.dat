500|$|Fellow judge James L. Oakes {{described}} Medina as a {{fair and}} reasonable judge, and wrote that [...] "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave {{them a little bit}} of their own medicine, too." [...] Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was [...] "unfriendly" [...] to the defense, and that [...] "there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> do that sort of thing , they'll destroy the government". According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had {{died of a heart attack}} during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.|$|E

We could have killed all the men that got into holes on the hill, but they were glad to let us alone, and so <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> alone too. Rain-in-the-Face was with me in the fight. There were twelve hundred of us. Might be no more than one {{thousand}} in the fight. Many of our Indians were out on a hunt." ...|$|E

[...] "Because we'd got our own eight-track studio <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> {{come down to the}} Dock Road and record there," [...] says Tony. [...] "They were quite naive about recording, so we'd show them how to play the songs, how to think about the structure of the songs and the dynamics. We were just helping them because that's what bands do in Liverpool. I don't think it's quite the same in Manchester, because no one had done anything for them before."' ...|$|E

5000|$|On 19 December, 2011, Israeli {{settlers}} {{were accused}} of carrying out a second price tag attack in only four days, in which five Palestinian-owned cars were burnt and the walls of several houses were sprayed with graffiti. During the first incident (15 December, 2011), the assailants not only vandalized a mosque, but also attacked an IDF military base in the West Bank, injuring a top Israeli commander. According to witnesses of the second incident, the Israeli army dispersed the settlers without arresting any of them, presumably also those who attacked the Israeli commander, although four days earlier the incident had prompted Israeli Prime-Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to say: [...] "We won't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> attack our soldiers. <b>We</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> ignite a religious war with our neighbors. <b>We</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> desecrate mosques. <b>We</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> harm Jews or Arabs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so kind," [...] she murmured, [...] "so very kind. Indeed I do {{not want}} to think of these things, which I do not understand, and which only puzzle me all the time. <b>We</b> will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> alone, is it not so? <b>We</b> will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> alone and talk about foolish things. Or you shall tell me about London, and the country--tell me what we will do. Indeed, I may go down to your home in Norfolk." ...|$|R
60|$|MALISE. Will you go {{in there}} for a minute? Or shall <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> ring--or--what? It may not be anything, of course.|$|E

"This is Demi's and {{my private}} place; we made it, {{and nobody can}} come up unless <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em,</b> except Daisy, <b>we</b> don't mind her," [...] said Tommy, as Nat looked with delight from the {{babbling}} brown water below to the green arch above, where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on the long yellow blossoms that filled the air with sweetness.|$|R

6000|$|... "Shockin'!" [...] said Stalky, {{collapsing}} in {{a helpless}} welter of half-hitched trousers. [...] "So dam' bad, too, for innocent boys like us! Wonder what they'd say at 'St. Winifred's, or the World of School.'--By gum! That reminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin' Beetle when he chivied Manders minor. Come on! It's an alibi, Samivel; and, besides, if <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> off they'll be worse next time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} they take their weapons with them?" [...] {{one of the men}} said; [...] "they will be useful to us. Why should <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> carry them away to kill more Spaniards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should recommend, sir," [...] he whispered, [...] "that we went away. If {{they know}} {{anything}} {{they do not}} mean to tell, and the less <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know as to whether we are satisfied or not, the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And after all," [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "I don't know {{what sort of}} {{preparations}} the young gentlemen would make if <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go by themselves. A bare room, perhaps-â€”with no bed-clothes, and nothing to eat till the table d'hote" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may as well. <b>We</b> can't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> starve, and {{by holding}} them prisoners {{we may be}} able to make terms with Dick Rover and his friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. 'You've over-fed him, ma'am. You've {{raised a}} {{artificial}} soul and spirit in him, ma'am unbecoming {{a person of}} his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It's quite enough that <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would never have happened.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my soul," [...] said Mr. Sherman, [...] "I'm disgusted. Now's {{the time}} to stop <b>'em.</b> The longer <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> rear and kick, the harder to break 'em. You don't catch me {{going back to the}} army for three months. If they want me, they've got to {{guarantee}} me three years. That's more like it." [...] Turning to Stephen, he added: [...] "Don't you sign any three months' contract, young man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> come in," [...] said they, [...] "they will wander {{about the}} streets a while, {{but they will}} soon get tired and go away; whereas, by {{opposing}} and thwarting them, we only make them the more violent and mischievous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they used}} the huts until quite recently. We've {{put them on the}} hulk until they recover their {{confidence}} a little. They were all half mad with fright, so <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go, and nobody sleeps on the island except Walker and myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{kept them}} at it till {{half an hour}} ago," [...] Willesden said apologetically, when they came up, [...] "but the Kaffirs said that unless we gave them a rest half of them would drop, so <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go easy till you came up." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Last year, {{after we}} lost {{we all had}} a sick feeling, Leftwich said. [...] "This year, <b>we</b> couldn't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> {{come in here and}} make us feel like that again.|$|R

6000|$|... "Talk {{about our}} keeping slaves, {{as if we}} did it for our convenience," [...] said Marie. [...] "I'm sure, if we {{consulted}} that, <b>we</b> might <b>let</b> <b>them</b> all go at once." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{started toward}} us once more, though I {{could see that}} they were terrified {{probably}} as much by the noise of the guns as by their effects. They never reached us. Half-way the three that remained turned and fled, and <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{there are}} the two little boys. <b>We</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go to the National School for the present.

60|$|ELLIE. Old-fashioned again. We {{know now}} that the soul is the body, and the body the soul.

I am afraid you are no use to me, Captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my lads," [...] said he, [...] "it {{is likely}} that these savages will try to take us by surprise. This they will not {{find it easy to}} do. From what I know of them they will come like the fox--slily--and try to pounce upon us. <b>We</b> will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> come; <b>we</b> will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> pounce, and not show face until such time as I give the word--then ye will know how to quit you like men. Away, all of you, to rest--each man with his shield above him and his sword by his side. I myself will do the part of sentinel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{has been}} talking to you about this deal. I'm not surprised. A {{lot of these people}} are angry because <b>we</b> didn't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> in. What have they been saying?" [...] he demanded.|$|R

"Charlie called Timeâ€™ again, and <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>â€™em</b> â€™ave {{five minutes}} while we â€™elped Tom to bed, and then wot â€™e called the â€™disgusting exhibishunâ€™ was resoomed.

60|$|One {{night we}} catched a little {{section of a}} lumber raft--nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor.

6000|$|... "If {{they want}} to catch us, {{they can do it}} if they can paddle faster than we can sail," [...] I said.

6000|$|... "Variety One subverted {{our whole}} north wing," [...] Rudi said. [...] "It {{was a long}} time before anyone caught on. Then it was too late.

We were watching out for machines...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{of their}} scouts," [...] Pearson answered, {{pointing}} to two dark bodies {{on the snow}} {{at a distance of}} about one hundred yards. [...] "I suppose they wanted to see ef we was on the watch. We made 'em out almost as soon as they left the shore, but <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> come on until we was sartin of our aim.

6000|$|... "It must be two {{or three}} hours past midnight, and if Borgon carried out my {{instructions}} help ought to be near at hand. I would that <b>we</b> could <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know of our peril." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{find out}} their game, sooner or later," [...] muttered Sol Blugg. [...] "We'll keep on their trail--but <b>we</b> mustn't <b>let</b> <b>'em</b> see us, or they'll take to some side-trail and {{put us in}} blind." ...|$|R
