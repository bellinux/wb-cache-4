5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} him {{questions}} {{with the intent to}} write a book about Earp. Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Founder Steve Ells {{attended}} the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, {{he became a}} line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> in San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.|$|E
5|$|Tavares {{was born}} on September 20, 1990 in Mississauga, Ontario, to Barbara and Joe Tavares, who are of Polish and Portuguese descent, respectively. His {{maternal}} grandparents Bolesław and Josephine Kowal immigrated from Poland to Sudbury, Ontario, and his paternal grandparents Manuel and Dorotea Tavares immigrated from Portugal to Toronto, Ontario. At a very young age, Tavares moved to Oakville, Ontario. This is where he was first exposed to minor hockey via the Minor Oaks Hockey Association. Tavares also played soccer and lacrosse, and his highly competitive nature often led him to fight with other players. Tavares excelled at lacrosse, {{following in the footsteps}} of his uncle John Tavares, the all-time scoring leader in the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and was a ball boy for his uncle's NLL team, the Buffalo Bandits. The younger Tavares credits his uncle with teaching him the importance of remaining unselfish, stating that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> by following his uncle with the Bandits has made him better both as a person and a hockey player. Many skills he learned in lacrosse—such as spinning off checks and battling in traffic—transferred to ice hockey and improved Tavares' abilities as a goal scorer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe premise {{from which}} we started our study implies that the best impact of {{teaching}} {{is represented by the}} involvement of the main sensory systems. Thus, the person who learns has to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (maps, graphics), has to hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (the teacher's voice) and has to experiment <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (by practice). Our point of view is that the favourite sensory system determines the learning style. In order to be efficient, education should represent a multisensory experience because what motivates learning is feeling in a good mood. A challenge that we will develop in the following lines...|$|R

5|$|The Season Nine DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include: more scenes from the Q panel; Pete discussing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> working at Dunder Mifflin; Angela's sister, Phyllis, and Andy giving toasts at the wedding; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories; and the office taking one of the potted plants outside and planting it in actual soil. The episode originally was scripted {{to begin with a}} different cold open; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim, in which Dwight is led to believe that he is actually living in the Matrix, a computer-simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name. The scene was either not filmed, or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes. A table read of it—along {{with the rest of the}} episode—was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

25|$|Rashi's {{teachers}} were students of Rabbeinu Gershom and Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol, leading Talmudists {{of the previous}} generation. From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud {{as they had been}} passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmud's unique logic and form of argument. Rashi took concise, copious notes from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> in yeshiva, incorporating this material in his commentaries.|$|E
25|$|The Merchant of Four Seasons uses melodrama as a {{style to}} create {{critical}} studies of contemporary German {{life for a}} general audience. It was Fassbinder's first effort to create what he declared he aspired to: a cinematic statement {{of the human condition}} that would transcend national boundaries as the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini had done. It is also his first realization of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> from Sirk: that people, however small they may be, and their emotions, however insignificant they may seem, could be big on the movie screen.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus {{traveled}} very extensively, {{collecting information}} and documenting his findings in his books on Europe, Asia, and Libya. He also combined his knowledge with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> {{from the people}} he met. Herodotus wrote his Histories in the mid-5th century BC. Although his work was dedicated {{to the story of}} long struggle of the Greeks with the Persian Empire, Herodotus also included everything he knew about the geography, history, and peoples of the world. Thus, his work provides a detailed picture of the known world of the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Without {{orders from}} his {{government}} (but based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> from a radio news service) {{the governor of}} American Samoa, Navy Commander John M. Poyer, instituted a rigorous quarantine policy. When he heard of the outbreak on Western Samoa, he banned travel to or from the neighbouring islands. Poyer persuaded the island's natives to mount a shore patrol to prevent illegal landings. People who disembarked from ships sailing from the American mainland were kept under house arrest for a specified period or examined daily. Aspects of the quarantine continued into mid-1920, a year after Poyer departed {{to the sound of}} a 17-gun salute. There were no influenza deaths on American Samoa.|$|E
25|$|In February 12, 1963, three karatekas from Oyama dojo (kyokushin later) {{went to the}} Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Thailand {{and fought}} against three Muay Thai fighters. The three kyokushin karate fighters' were Tadashi Nakamura, Kenji Kurosaki and Akio Fujihira (also known as Noboru Osawa), while the Muay Thai team were {{composed}} of only one authentic Thai fighter. Japan won by 2–1: Tadashi Nakamura and Akio Fujihira both KOed opponents by punch while Kenji Kurosaki, who fought the Thai, was KOed by elbow. This {{should be noted that}} the only Japanese loser Kenji Kurosaki was then a kyokushin instructor rather than a contender and temporarily designated as a substitute for the absent chosen fighter. On June of the same year, karateka and future kickboxer Tadashi Sawamura faced against top Thai fighter Samarn Sor Adisorn, in which Sawamura was knocked down 16 times and defeated. Sawamura would use <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> in that fight to incorporate in the evolving kickboxing tournaments.|$|E

25|$|Born into {{a family}} of mariners, Champlain, while still a young man, began {{exploring}} North America in 1603 {{under the guidance of}} François Gravé Du Pont, his uncle. From 1604 to 1607 Champlain participated in the exploration and settlement of the first permanent European settlement north of Florida, Port Royal, Acadia (1605) as well as the first European settlement that would become Saint John, New Brunswick (1604). Then, in 1608, he established the French settlement that is now Quebec City. Champlain was the first European to explore and describe the Great Lakes, and published maps of his journeys and accounts of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> from the natives and the French living among the Natives. He formed relationships with local Montagnais and Innu and later with others farther west (Ottawa River, Lake Nipissing, or Georgian Bay), with Algonquin and with Huron Wendat, and agreed to provide assistance in the Beaver Wars against the Iroquois.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Foot {{had never}} visited India before {{accepting}} {{the position of}} headmaster, and knew little of Dehradun beyond <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> by consulting an atlas. He noted that {{it appeared to be}} surrounded by forests and close to mountains, and the possibilities of outdoor recreation and mountaineering seem to have influenced his decision as much as the chance to create a completely new type of school in India. Foot's first action upon being offered the position was to recruit J.A.K. (John) Martyn from Harrow School as his deputy. Doon's ethos and guiding principles were determined early in its life by Foot, Martyn, R.L. Holdsworth and Jack Gibson, who went on to become Principal of Mayo College. While these masters all came from very traditional British schools, they were determined to create a uniquely Indian public school rather than a transplanted British institution, and they were soon joined in their efforts by equally influential Indians such as Sudhir Khastgir (the school's first art teacher, who had trained previously in Santiniketan) and Gurdial Singh, a pioneering mountaineer who taught at Doon for several decades.|$|E
