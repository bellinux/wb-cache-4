The questionnaire {{was developed by the}} researchers, to identify whether siblings are interested in online peer support, with whom, in what form and discussing what themes. The themes included in the questionnaire were identified by clinical psychologists from the Psychosocial department of Emma Children’s Hospital/Amsterdam UMC, and based on existing literature and clinical experience. The questionnaire consisted of nine items, partly open (e.g. <b>What</b> themes <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> discuss in online support) and partly multiple-choice (e.g. In <b>what</b> form <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> online support).
