Dominic thinks Roth <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Tony Rosato, who has become active in Florida, but instead he needs Dominic's help {{in dealing with the}} Granados family. Don Rico Granados (Vic Polizos) is highly {{connected}} politically, and Roth needs Dominic to weaken the family by taking over their businesses and assassinating their made men. At the same time, Dominic goes after Tony Rosato, who he forces back to New York, and ultimately kills.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{announcement}} of the Switch version, Psyonix affirmed that it would support cross-platform play with PC and Xbox users. Sony still opted not to participate in this; PlayStation global marketing head Jim Ryan said that while they are [...] "open to conversations with any developer or publisher who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it", their decision was [...] "a commercial discussion between ourselves and other stakeholders". Dunham says that in contrast to Microsoft or Nintendo, who agreed to allow cross-platform play within a month and with the day of Pysonix' request, respectively, Sony has been asked on a nearly daily basis about this support and have yet to receive any definitive answer.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson had {{considered}} postponing music for other career plans, but ultimately decided {{to record a}} new album. Jackson attempted several new musical styles; lyrically exploring her sexuality more explicitly and freely. A central theme of split personalities is incorporated within the content of several songs. Jackson stated [...] "It shows the different sides of me, the different characters that I feel that I display at different moments in my life" [...] "I am divulging myself a little more on this album, and it's definitely much more intimate. That's another side of myself that people have seen, but not to this level." [...] Comparing the process of producing to directing, Jackson searched for [...] "sensitive people who can technically express what I'm going through emotionally" [...] while seeking new collaborators. Jimmy Jam added; [...] "Her albums are always what she's thinking at the moment." [...] "Her thoughts may change six months from now. Her biggest thing is {{to be honest with}} her fans. Whatever stuff she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> it's coming from her heart." [...] Dallas Austin said [...] "she always shows what's going on with her life through her records, reveals the phase she's in with her life and brings out that experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of its}} history, Shaolin {{martial arts}} was largely weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. [...] Even the more recent {{military}} exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting {{so that they could}} protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been {{the most important part of}} Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting known as Da Laitai (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and were organized by government organizations; some were also organized by the public. The government competitions resulted in appointments to military posts for winners and were held in the capital as well as in the prefectures.|$|E

There was an enterprising gentleman named Gayes in Liverpool, who nearly drove me crazy, then there's this Mr. Lawton who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> lasts, and finally it seems that I dined at the Trocadero and spent the evening at the Empire and Murray's with the two very obvious-looking young ladies who accosted me just now.

But you cannot recreate one life by destroying another. There is no human means of ascertaining justice, but we can always do mercy with divine omniscience."

6000|$|And {{then the}} higher culture. I know that culture. I would not set any man free for it if I could help it. The effect {{of it on}} the rich men who are free for it is so horrible that it is worse {{than any of the other}} amusements of the millionaire--worse than gambling, worse even than philanthropy. It means {{thinking}} the smallest poet in Belgium greater than the greatest poet of England. It means losing every democratic sympathy. It means being unable to talk to a navvy about sport, or about beer, or about the Bible, or about the Derby, or about patriotism, or about anything whatever that he, the navvy, <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> It means taking literature seriously, a very amateurish thing to do. It means pardoning indecency only when it is gloomy indecency. Its disciples will call a spade a spade; but only when it is a grave-digger's spade. The higher culture is sad, cheap, impudent, unkind, without honesty and without ease. In short, it is [...] "high." [...] That abominable word (also applied to game) admirably describes it.|$|E
