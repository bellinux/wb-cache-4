30|$|To {{meet the}} {{objectives}} of this study, the following keywords which have been selected from related studies in groundwater (Al-Adamat et al. 2003; Almasri and Kaluarachchi Almasri and Kaluarachchi 2004, 2005; Bakalowicz 2005; Edmunds et al. 2003; Garmes et al. 2002; Storey et al. 2003; Tahaikt et al. 2007) were entered into the Scopus as article titles: “groundwater”, “ground-water”, “ground water”, “ground waters”, and “water ground”. The effective keywords were: “groundwater*”, “ground water*” and “water ground”. The term “water ground” refers to expressions mentioned in the article titles such as “surface water/ground water; salt water–ground water, etc.”. The advanced search captures the word “water” from the first term, and the word “ground” from the second term to form the term “water ground”. The asterisk (*) in the second word of the used terms {{has been used as}} a <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> <b>character</b> to simplify the search and to make it more comprehensive since this format will track all possible forms of the used terms (i.e., it was more inclusive when (“ground water*”) search term was used in comparison with the use of (“ground water”). All subject areas within Scopus database which include: life, health, social and physical sciences were chosen. Furthermore, all types of documents in Scopus database will be considered excluding the erratum type of documents. The twenty-two Arab countries: Saudi Arabia; Egypt; Jordan; Palestine; Lebanon; Qatar; Bahrain; Kuwait; Morocco; Tunisia; Syrian Arab Republic; United Arab Emirates; Iraq; Sudan; Yemen; Algeria; Comoros; Djibouti; Libya; Mauritania; Oman; and Somalia will be employed as country keys during the search process.|$|E

Next, {{a summary of the}} techniques for detecting policy conflicts is given. Finally, a new language, Path-based Policy Language (PPL), which offers improvements to these is introduced.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} pattern matching with k mismatches, where there can be don't care or <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> <b>characters</b> in the pattern. Specifically, given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, {{we want to find}} all occurrences of P in T that have no more than k mismatches. The pattern can have don't care characters, which match any character. Without don't cares, the best known algorithm for pattern matching with k mismatches has a runtime of O(n√(k k)). With don't cares in the pattern, the best deterministic algorithm has a runtime of O(nk polylog m). Therefore, there is an important gap between the versions with and without don't cares. In this paper we give an algorithm whose runtime increases with the number of don't cares. We define an island to be a maximal length substring of P that does not contain don't cares. Let q be the number of islands in P. We present an algorithm that runs in O(n√(k m) +n{√(qk^ 2 m),√(q m) }) time. If the number of islands q is O(k) this runtime becomes O(n√(k m)), which essentially matches the best known runtime for pattern matching with k mismatches without don't cares. If the number of islands q is O(k^ 2), this algorithm is asymptotically faster than the previous best algorithm for pattern matching with k mismatches with don't cares in the pattern.

30|$|As weak {{signals are}} seen to precede or {{indicate}} <b>wild</b> <b>cards,</b> identifying weak signals and interpreting them can produce information on <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [38]. Another possibility is to directly try to identify <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and then assess and monitor them by identifying weak signals that could indicate these <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> For example, Petersen and Steinmüller introduce a <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> methodology that starts by directly identifying <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [29]. This {{can be done by}} using published lists of <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> 3 However, they recommend collecting or inventing <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> specific to case in question. This can be done by, for example, brainstorming, science fictioning and genius forecasting [10]. The identified <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> are assessed and their amount is narrowed down so that only the ones deemed most relevant will be considered in the following phases. The third phase consists of monitoring weak signals of the <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b> In the fourth phase, options for action (to prevent, to prepare for, or to promote <b>wild</b> <b>cards)</b> are discussed.|$|R

In the literature the examples labelled as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> do not always meet this definition. I have divided changes into two categories according to the rapidity of the change taking place: <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and gradual changes. By looking at the examples of <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> in the literature, I found {{that a large number of}} them are actually gradual changes. This paper also clarifies the difference between <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and weak signals, which are sometimes considered synonymous. Weak signals are a means of avoiding blindness to gradual changes and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> in advance...|$|R

2500|$|Some players accept <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> (...) {{when playing}} Mahjong. The <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> are decided at the {{beginning}} of the game. The <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> can be the next tile after spreading tiles to all players or separately decided by a dice toss. <b>Wild</b> <b>cards</b> are not allowed to be discarded and can replace any tiles in Chows. Wildcards can't replace any tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 taken out, then character 4 and the next number 5 can be used as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> in this round (When the tile showed, the tiles of the same pattern left only 3, so the next tile in the suit will be used as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as well, adding to 7 <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> for 4 players). Also, if a tile numbered 9 is chosen, then the number 9 and 1 are <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R

30|$|Some use <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as {{a synonym}} for weak signals. Hiltunen however, defines <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as events with a huge impact whereas weak signals are signs of events or {{emerging}} issues, such as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [1]. Whether or not one considers these two terms as synonyms, depends on how one defines weak signals. If one accepts that weak signals can be both events and signs of events, then <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and weak signals can be used interchangeably. However, if one maintains that weak signals are not events in themselves but indications of them, <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and weak signals are not synonyms. Instead, it can be perceived that weak signals precede <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> Thus, weak signals can be employed {{as a means to}} anticipate <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [1, 30].|$|R

5000|$|Flush: When <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> are used, a <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> {{contained}} in a flush {{is considered to be}} of the highest rank not already present in the hand. For example, in the hand (Wild) 10♥ 8♥ 5♥ 4♥, the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> plays as the A♥, but in the hand A♣ K♣ (Wild) 9♣ 6♣, it plays as the Q♣. (As noted above, if a <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> would complete a straight flush, it will play as the card that would make the highest possible hand.) A variation is the double-ace flush rule, in which a <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> in a flush always plays as an ace, even if one is already present (unless the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> would complete a straight flush). In such a game, the hand A♠ (Wild) 9♠ 5♠ 2♠ would defeat A♦ K♦ Q♦ 10♦ 8♦ (the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> playing as an imaginary second A♠), whereas by the standard rules it would lose (because even with the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> playing as a K♠, the latter hand's Q♦ outranks the former's 9♠).|$|R

5000|$|The {{statistic}} {{got even}} more complicated in 2012 when Major League Baseball added a second <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> team. Today, games behind {{is shown in the}} media as calculated in two different ways. While games behind the team with the highest standing in the division is calculated in the traditional manner, games behind in the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> race is calculated with respect to the team with second highest standing in the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> race. Assuming two or more teams are not tied for first place in the <b>wild</b> <b>card,</b> this results in the team leading the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> race shown as being so many [...] "games ahead" [...] of second place, usually indicated by a plus sign ("+") in the standings. Currently, both the divisional and <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> statistics are called Games Behind or GB in the media.

5000|$|There is a {{tendency}} among some players to regard <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as [...] "impure" [...] or treat <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> games as silly or amateurish. While {{it is certainly true}} that a game with too many <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> can become so random that all skill is lost, the occasional use of <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> {{is a good way to}} add variation to a game and add opportunities for skillful play. In particular, five-card draw is traditionally played with a joker in California (which plays as a bug), and also plays well with deuces fully wild. Seven-card stud plays well with one or two bugs, especially when played high-low split. Other games such as Texas hold 'em and Omaha hold'em do not play well with <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> For some players, the problem with <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> games is that the winner is almost always the hand with the most <b>wild</b> <b>cards,</b> making the other cards irrelevant, and making skill less important.|$|R
