5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine <b>woodworm,</b> which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that <b>woodworm</b> had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1867, and {{originally}} included a drawbridge section at its north end for tall ships to pass, {{though this was}} later replaced by the current swing bridge section. In 1980, <b>woodworm</b> threatened {{the safety of the}} bridge, which needed major repairs to avoid closure. Tolls were collected for foot and cycle traffic until 2013. The bridge is a Grade II* listed structure, and has one of the longest timber viaducts still in regular use in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The block {{passed into}} the hands of the Amsterdam printer and {{cartographer}} Willem Janssen (also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names). By this time the block was very damaged; the border lines were chipped, there were numerous <b>woodworm</b> holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino's legs. Janssen decided to re-issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours, olive-green and dark green, as well as blue-grey. The resulting chiaroscuro woodcut, which entirely omitted the text, was published after 1620. There is an example in the British Museum. This was the seventh of the eight editions in all of the print.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to <b>woodworm,</b> and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or <b>woodworm,</b> and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E

5000|$|The term woodboring beetle {{encompasses}} {{many species}} and families of beetles whose larval or adult forms eat and destroy wood (i.e., are xylophagous).

50|$|The {{wood was}} {{especially}} prized by shipbuilders. It could be worked {{as soon as}} it was felled, and was naturally resistant to rot and <b>woodworms.</b> It was as strong as oak, but much lighter, contributing to the speed and maneouverability for which Bermudian ships were noted and prized. Its abundance enabled Bermudians to turn wholesale to a maritime economy after the dissolution of the Somers Isles Company in 1684.|$|R

Besides the narration accounted in the Bible, new elements are encountered here: e. g. the Ark wasn’t a simple vessel, {{but a small}} fleet; Noah butchered the animals from the Ark, animals selected initially to be saved from the Deluge; the <b>woodworms,</b> creatures that symbolize decay, were also present on the Ark, etc. Then, new versions of the Biblical story, all having connections with Noah, the Ark and the Sea are present. Therefore, Julian Barnes fructifies Noah’s story, readjusting it to other spaces and historic times...|$|R

It shows various steps of the restoration project safeguarding the painting against <b>woodworms,</b> found in the painting's wood panel and exterminated, and centuries of encrusted dust and dirt. The documentary's main protagonists include museum executives and art conservation experts such as San Marco Museum director Dr. Magnolia Scudieri and Florentine restorer Rossella Lari. The restored painting was completed in October 2006, and unveiled at Florence's San Marco Museum where it is exhibited in the large refectory. In her ending comment, Scudieri states, [...] "Not only can we more clearly see the painting's expressive intensity thanks to this restoration, we can also more fully understand the convent life of Plautilla Nelli and her time in Florence.|$|R

25|$|With {{the backing}} of {{investment}} bankers, Sillett launched The <b>Woodworm</b> Cricket Company. The company sold just over 200 {{in its first year}} of trading. By 2005, this had rocketed to over 15,000, propelled with sponsorship of big name players such as Flintoff and Pietersen.|$|E

5000|$|... "To {{protect the}} bed from damage and prevent pests from {{spreading}} to other works of art, it {{was critical to}} treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's <b>woodworms</b> in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals {{were involved in the}} treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely." ...|$|R
50|$|Over the centuries, {{extensive}} deforestation has occurred, {{with only}} small {{remnants of the}} original forests surviving. Deforestation has been particularly severe in Lebanon and on Cyprus; on Cyprus, only small trees up to 25 m tall survive, though Pliny the Elder recorded cedars 40 m tall there. Extensive reforestation of cedar is {{carried out in the}} Mediterranean region. In Turkey, over 50 million young cedars are planted annually; covering an area of approximately 300 km2. Lebanese cedar populations are also expanding through an active program combining replanting and protection of natural regeneration from browsing goats, hunting, forest fires, and <b>woodworms.</b> The Lebanese approach emphasizes natural regeneration by creating proper growing conditions. The Lebanese state has created several reserves including the Chouf Cedar Reserve, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the Tannourine Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the Cedars of God near Bsharri.|$|R
50|$|According to Pherecydes, Melampous overhears two <b>woodworms</b> {{saying that}} a beam in the ceiling of his prison is about to collapse. He asks the guards to carry him out, and as they step outside, the ceiling collapses, killing another female guard who treated Melampous badly. One of the {{surviving}} guards informs Phylakos and Phylakos tells Iphiklos. The two agree to give Melampous the sought after cattle if Melampous can cure Iphiklos’ inability to beget children. Melampous makes the appropriate sacrifices to Zeus and asks the birds to whom he distributes portions of the sacrifice for help. The birds bring Melampous a vulture who tells him that Phylakos chased Iphiklos with a knife, presumably because Iphiklos had seen Phylakos do something mischievous. Phylakos, upon failing to catch Iphiklos, planted the knife in a wild pear tree and the bark grew over it. Melampous retrieved the knife and mixed the rust from the knife with wine. Iphiklos drank the wine for 10 days. Eventually a child, Podarkes, is born and the cattle are given to Melampous, who takes the cattle to Neleus as the bride price for Pero. He gives Pero to Bias to wed.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, McTell {{signed a}} deal with the label Castle Communications to produce a {{compilation}} of his love songs.

25|$|<b>Woodworm</b> {{quickly became}} one of the most {{instantly}} recognisable cricket brands, thanks to bright green, yellow and orange stickers and the cutaway edges on their bats, and the flamboyant nature of their contracted professionals.

25|$|In {{the later}} 1980s, {{things began to}} look much more {{positive}} for the genre. After disbandment, Fairport’s Cropredy Festival went from strength to strength growing to a regular 20,000 fans a year, and when they reformed in 1985 {{they were able to}} embark on increasingly successful tours and produce a series of highly regarded albums. The reason for this recording revival was partly because they abandoned the mainstream record business, instead focusing on growing their own audience and producing records through their own labels (<b>Woodworm</b> and Matty Grooves).|$|E
500|$|The plan failed. Lee {{began his}} mission with only twenty minutes of air, {{not to mention}} the {{complications}} of operating the craft. The darkness, the speed of the currents, and the added complexities all combined to thwart Lee’s plan. Once surfaced, Lee lit the fuse on the explosive and tried multiple times to stab the device into the underside of the ship. Unfortunately, after several attempts Lee was not able to pierce Eagle’s hull and abandoned the operation as the timer on the explosive was due to go off and he feared getting caught at dawn. A popular story held that he failed due to the copper lining covering the ship's hull. The Royal Navy had recently begun installing copper sheathing on the bottoms of their warships to protect from damage by <b>woodworms</b> and other marine life, however the lining was paper-thin and could not have stopped Lee from drilling through it. Bushnell believed Lee's failure was probably due to an iron plate connected to the ship's rudder hinge. [...] When Lee attempted another spot in the hull, he was unable to stay beneath the ship, and eventually abandoned the attempt. It seems more likely that he was suffering from fatigue and carbon dioxide inhalation, which made him confused and unable to properly carry out the process of drilling through the Eagles hull. Lee reported British soldiers on Governors Island spotted the submersible and rowed out to investigate. [...] He then released the charge (which he called a [...] "torpedo", the prevailing term for underwater explosive devices prior to about 1890), [...] "expecting that they would seize that likewise, and thus all would be blown to atoms." [...] Suspicious of the drifting charge, the British retreated back to the island. [...] Lee reported that the charge drifted into the East River, where it exploded [...] "with tremendous violence, throwing large columns of water and pieces of wood that composed it high into the air." [...] It was the first recorded use of a submarine to attack a ship; however, the only records documenting it are American. British records contain no accounts of an attack by a submarine or any reports of explosions {{on the night of the}} supposed attack on Eagle.|$|R
25|$|The Madonna {{was first}} {{restored}} in 1905. By then the statue's core was riddled with <b>woodworm</b> tunnels {{and threatened to}} collapse. The restorers carefully wrapped the statue in a plaster cast, insufflated the cavities to remove bore dust, impregnated them with insecticides and finally filled them {{with a mixture of}} glue, chalk and water, turning the figure around repeatedly in the process so as to reach every nook and angle. The surface holes were then sealed with bolts of oak. The restoration cost a total of 3,200 Goldmarks, part of which was paid by the Prussian state.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 the church’s organ was {{supplied}} by Forster and Andrews of Hull, {{at a cost}} of £270. By the 1980s <b>woodworm</b> attack had necessitated a restoration, with only five ranks of the original pipes, diapason front pipes, and the organ casing remaining unaffected. The restoration was carried out by Henry Groves & Son of Nottingham in 1986, who amalgamated the original with a Gray and Davison organ from Christ Church Chilwell, and added a separate organ console within the north aisle. From the previous organ remained 456 pipes, to which were added a further 362. The refurbished organ was dedicated by the Bishop of Grantham.|$|E
