5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations of the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

50|$|The early 2000s were a time {{of great}} change and {{consolidation}} within the United <b>Way.</b> <b>In</b> 2000 the organization changed its name to the United <b>Way</b> <b>in</b> Chicago. In 2003, under President and CEO Janet Froetscher, the United <b>Way</b> <b>in</b> Chicago and the by now overwhelmingly numerous suburban United Ways consolidated into one organization, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago. This was the largest non-profit merger in history.|$|R

50|$|The {{virtuality}} continuum {{has grown}} and progressed past labels such as computer science and new media. As the concept {{has much to}} do with the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which humans continue to change how they communicate; the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which form identities and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which they interact to and within the world; it is more accurately described as a subject within anthropology.|$|R

5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in them. When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements {{of the four}} factors are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many <b>ways,</b> <b>in</b> part because Poe's sincerity {{in the work}} is questionable.

5|$|Fish steaks are {{generally}} cooked {{for a short}} time, as the flesh cooks quickly, especially when grilled.

In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they have six coloured tepals, and so could be called 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{case reports}} exist {{from before the}} twentieth century, but were {{influenced}} greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time.

5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} many <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the sail could have functioned in life.

Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
