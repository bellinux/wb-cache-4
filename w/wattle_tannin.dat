30|$|The major {{components}} of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> are polyflavanoids consisting of flavan- 3 -ols as monomers and their polymers. Although {{the use of}} <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> in leather tanning commenced in the early 1820 s, the commercial use of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> as a major component {{in the manufacture of}} wood adhesives commenced only {{in the middle of the}} 1960 s. Details of the historical development of tannin adhesives for use in structural and external application wood products and a new approach to the use of the tannin in the bark without extraction, which was described as “bark adhesives” from radiata pine, were reported in 2015 [1].|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the use of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> as an adsorbent of toxic metals in broilers fed on diets with different levels of replacement of limestone with golden mussel meal. First, we conducted a trial {{to evaluate the}} performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days old when fed on <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin.</b> For this we used 720 male broiler chicks that were one day old, in a completely randomized design with six treatments and six replications. The treatments were composed of basal diets with increasing levels of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> (0, 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 g tonne- 1), where the tannin replaced the inert material of the feed. All of the diets were isonutritive and isocaloric. The results showed that 250 g tonne- 1 of tannin was detrimental to weight gain, final weight and feed conversion, and the use of 1000 g tonne- 1 of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin,</b> in addition to these effects, caused a drop in consumption of the ration. There was no effect of treatment on morphometric measurements of villi, crypt or the villus:crypt ratio. Next, we conducted a second test to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks from 1 to 21 days of age when fed with increasing levels of replacement (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 %) of limestone with golden mussel and even supplementation or not <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin.</b> Five repetitions were used and the birds were housed in a completely randomized design. In diets with the inclusion of tannin, 250 g tonne- 1 of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> was used, which replaced the inert material in the feed. In this test, 1200 male broiler chicks that were one day old were used. The results showed that the golden mussel contains large quantities of calcium, with low concentrations of toxic metals and microbiological contamination within the allowed range. Performance data show that mussel can be used to replace up to 100 % of limestone in feed without affecting the variables, but the use of 250 g tonne- 1 of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> affects the performance of chicks. Bone quality was not changed by the treatments. Phosphorus and calcium in the bones remained stable during treatment and only the gray variation showed interaction effects from the use of mussel and <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{environmental}} impacts caused by chemical substances harmful to the environment and human health, the black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> can be used as an environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor in acid and near neutral media. This paper provides information on the application of black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> as an inhibitor against the corrosion of carbon steel. The inhibition was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarization (PP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature in aerated 0. 1 mol Lˉ¹ Na 2 SO 4 (pH 6. 0 and 2. 5). The black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> when used as a corrosion inhibitor is more effective at acidic pH, its efficiency being dependent on its concentration.

40|$|The use of {{modified}} black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> as an antifouling pigment {{is reported}} in this work. A mixture of tannin adsorbed in activated carbon (soluble fraction of tannin) and low soluble fraction of tannin {{was used as an}} antifouling pigment. The soluble rosin resin was used as a paint matrix. C- 13 NMR analysis confirm the modification of black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> through the cleavage of tannin interflavonoid bonds. FTIR spectra indicate the presence of tannin in the formulated antifouling coating even after 7 months of its exposure in a marine environment. Water contact angle analysis shows the hydrophilic characteristic of the tannin antifouling coating surface. Immersion tests at Badalona Port in the Mediterranean Sea shows the high antifouling efficiency of the TAN coating, comparable to commercial paint, until 7 months.

40|$|Tannins are plant-derived {{polyphenols}} with antimicrobial effects. The {{mechanism of}} tannin toxicity towards Escherichia coli {{was determined by}} using an extract from Acacia mearnsii (Black wattle) {{as a source of}} condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins). E. coli growth was inhibited by tannins only when tannins were exposed to oxygen. Tannins auto-oxidize, and substantial hydrogen peroxide was generated when they were added to aerobic media. The addition of exogenous catalase permitted growth in tannin medium. E. coli mutants that lacked HPI, the major catalase, were especially sensitive to tannins, while oxyR mutants that constitutively overexpress antioxidant enzymes were resistant. A tannin-resistant mutant was isolated in which a promoter-region point mutation increased the level of HPI by 10 -fold. Our results indicate that <b>wattle</b> condensed <b>tannins</b> are toxic to E. coli in aerobic medium primarily because they generate H 2 O 2.

40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} into various aspects of tannin-protein interactions including adverse effects on digestive enzymes, an attempt of structural analysis using selective precipitation with PVP, and their potential industrial utilization. ^ Tannin interaction with digestive enzymes was studied {{as a function of}} pH. Complex formation was minimal under pH conditions normally expected for each specific enzyme tested. Trypsinogen-tannin complex formation indicated possible precipitation in the duodenum. ^ In feeding studies with rats, using high <b>tannin</b> sorghum and <b>wattle</b> <b>tannins,</b> the level of enzymatic activity was increased when tannins were present in the diet. The increase was not statistically significant, but indicated that the antinutritional effects of dietary tannins are not a consequence of digestive enzyme inhibition. ^ Distention of the stomach and intestinal tract was observed in rats on a high tannin sorghum diet. The chyme was coarser and association of intestinal material into discrete packets was observed in the duodenum. ^ Various tannin preparations exhibited differences in their interaction with PVP. PVP precipitation by tannins apparently follows a classification scheme based on polymers of catechin and epicatechin. A possible mode of interaction between PVP and tannins is presented, along with evidence suggesting that PVP is not a good model system for tannin-protein interactions. Experimental evidence used to support hydrogen bonding as the predominant mechanism for tannin-protein interaction, as based on polyamide polymers, is therefore questioned. ^ Tannins which do not form a precipitable complex with PVP do interact, but with formation of a soluble complex. The soluble complex is not disrupted by addition of PVP precipitating tannins or catechin. The PVP negative tannins compete with PVP positive tannins for available binding sites and limit PVP precipitation by PVP positive tannins. ^ Formation of an insoluble tannin-protein complex is here suggested to arise by a two-step mechanism. Initially hydrophobic interactions are involved, which may provide for an increase in entropy to allow for spontaneous precipitation. Hydrogen bond formation then occurs to achieve a lattice network which precipitates. ^ To investigate possible industrial utilization of tannin-protein interactions, condensed tannins were immobilized on porous cellulose beads. The results indicate that problems remain to be solved, in particular a modification of the internal structure which limits access of large molecular weight proteins to the tannin binding sites. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{flavonoid}} compounds, {{which have}} been used commercially, are tannins derived from barks and woods. One {{of the most commonly}} used tannins is <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin,</b> which is obtained as a hot water extract from the bark of black wattle (Acacia mearnsii De Wild.) [1, 2]. As reported in the early history of Australia, Acacia mearnsii bark was first identified in 1814 as one of the excellent sources of tannins for the tanning of leather and a textile factory was opened at Botany Bay in New South Wales in 1815 with a tannery established before 1820 [3].|$|E

30|$|To obtain basic {{information}} on the stability, decomposition, and recycling of biodegradable polyurethane foam (PUF), we studied hydrolysis and aminolysis of the PUF derived from <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> (WT). The WT-PUF exhibited almost the same stability to a hydrolytic treatment at room temperature as trimethylolpropane (TMP)-PUF, which was prepared by cross-linking with TMP. Weight loss and strength loss of WT-PUF were much larger than those of TMP-PUF during the hydrolytic treatment at an elevated temperature. Hydrolysis was mainly responsible for the cleavage of urethane bonds to form WT and amines at {{the initial stages of}} the treatment. At the later stages, however, urethane bonds seemed to be cleaved not only by the hydrolysis but also by aminolysis with the amines formed in the system.|$|E

40|$|Green <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> {{extracts}} {{were separated}} by lead salt precipitation into a phenolic tannin fraction and a nontannin fraction. The combustion analysis of the tannin fraction corresponded to an empirical formula C₁₅H₁₄O₆. Methoxy and acetyl values showed four oxygens were hydroxy groups while the residual oxygens could either be ether linked or carbonyl groups. Diazomethane methylation produced a white product of high methoxyl value which indicated that the four hydroxyl groups were phenolic. Chromatography of the lead salt purified tannin showed an indistinct non-fluorescent trail. Ether extraction of the tannin removed the associated Phenolic bodies. The ethereal extract unlike black wattle extracts contained no fisetin and evaporation of the ethereal solutions yielded a gummy non-crystalline residue. Alkaline fusion of the purified tannin produced for the first tlme a variety of acidic and phenolic compounds i. e. resorcinol, pyrogaloll, phloroglucinol β-resorcylic acid, gallic acid and protocatechuic acid. From the high yields of resorcinol (6 %) and gallic acid (3 %), these units appear to predominate.

30|$|Recently, it {{was found}} that the mixture of tannin and sucrose had {{adhesiveness}} for wood [8]. However, the detailed manufacture conditions and bonding properties for wood-based materials bonded with tannin–sucrose resin were not investigated. <b>Wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> has a poly-hydroxyphenol structure and a molecular weight ranging from 500 to 10, 000  Da. It is widely used in the tanning and adhesive industries [9], and has also been researched in the context of wine manufacture [10] and medicine [11]. Sucrose is a common disaccharide used as a condiment and food ingredient, whose chemical characteristics have been well researched, and under the heating treatment, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF) was generated [12, 13]. The adhesive with phenol and 5 -HMF was already researched [14], and because the reactivity of the reaction between tannin and formaldehyde was 10 – 50 times higher rate of the reaction between phenol and formaldehyde [15], tannin was considered as a suited substitute of phenol, and therefore, there is a possibility to use tannin and sucrose as an adhesive for wood-based materials. In this study, tannin and sucrose were used to form an adhesive for particleboard, and fundamental manufacture conditions were studied. The effects of the different mixture ratios of tannin and sucrose, drying treatment after spraying and different resin contents on the physical properties of the resulting particleboard were investigated. The reaction mechanism between tannin and sucrose was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the methods for extraction of tannin from the bark of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis, as well as {{to evaluate the}} technical feasibility of using tannins from the barks of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis, of Acacia mearnsii, the mixtures of black wattle and pine tannins and the mixture of adhesive urea formaldehyde (UF) with black wattle and pine tannins in the production of adhesives for particleboard. The barks of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis were fragmented in hammer mill, sieved and extracted under reflux for 2 hours, using a bark: liquor relation of 1 : 15, in nine treatments. The best extraction was used to obtain large quantities of extracts, which were used in the manufacture of adhesives and mixtures with UF adhesive and tannins of black wattle and the manufacture of particleboard. The addition of sodium sulfite gave higher extraction of tannin, which was extracted with the addition of 5 % sodium sulfite. The results showed that both the black <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin,</b> as the bark of Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis have good bonding properties. It is possible to add pine tannin solution to the solution of black wattle and to replace part of the UF adhesive for the wattle tannins up to 25 %, without compromising the glue quality. Replacing 10 % of UF for tannic extract, both pine and black wattle, did not alter the values of thickness swelling (TS) of the panels. It is possible to obtain good mechanical properties with UF adhesives modified with tannic extracts at a ratio of 10 %. The high values found for the internal bond (IB) panels containing tannin extracts showed the potential of these tannic extracts for bonding wood materials...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. Nematode parasites {{have become}} the biggest problem for small {{ruminant}} production in South Africa due to their resistance to the commercial anthelmintics. Notable, <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> {{has been used as}} an alternative strategy for control. However, the concentration and the frequencies can likely influence its effect on the parasites control. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the degree of pasture infestation and nematode infection in sheep and goats, as well as investigate nematode resistance to the anthelmintics, and the potential of <b>wattle</b> <b>tannin</b> in nematode control. The first study dealt with the epidemiology of internal parasites. Eight Merino ewes and eight Nguni does averaged 7 - 18 months of age were observed for 1 year during the months of February 2008 to January 2009 at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Research Farm (Ukulinga). Egg count per gram (EPG) and coccidian oocysts per gram (OPG) were counted according to Mc Master Technique (Hansen & Perry, 1994) by magnifying parasitic eggs from monthly rectal faecal samples dissolved in saturated sodium chloride. Faecal samples also were cultured for 15 days to identify infective nematode larvae (L 3) using Baermann technique. Herbage samples were collected monthly from four paddocks as well to count L 3 on the pasture. Sheep live weight was also recorded monthly. Seasonal effects was significant (P< 0. 05) on the EPG, OPG, faecal culture L 3 and pasture L 3. A higher level of infection was observed in summer (wet) than in winter (dry season). Trichostrongylus spp larvae were the most prevalent larvae (26. 5 %) while Strongyloides, Haemonchus contortus, Nematodirus and Cooperia spp occurred in the faecal culture by percentage of 20. 9 %, 16 %, 16 % and 14. 5 %, respectively. For parasite resistance, Ivermectin 1 % (IVM), Closantel 5 % (CST) and a combination of Abamectin 0. 08 % and Praziquantel 1. 5 % (CPA) were evaluated. Twenty four sheep (12 females and 12 males) aged between 7 - 18 months were used for 21 days. Animals were naturally infested by gastro-intestinal parasites. EPG and faecal culture L 3 were counted on day 0, 7, 14 and 21. Closantel was the most effective. Haemonchus spp. were least affected whilst Trichostrongylus spp. were the most affected by all drugs. In the third study, wattle tannins were evaluated as an alternative nematode control drug. Three experiments (Exp.) were conducted to determine the effect of tannin concentration (Exp. 1 and 2) and frequency (Exp. 3) on nematode parasites. In Exp. 1, 0, 0. 8, 1. 6 and 2. 4 g tannin/kg BW were drenched for three consecutive days per sheep (16 females and 8 males, aged 8 - 9 months) for 21 day. In Exp. 2, 30 sheep (14 males and 16 females, aged 9 - 18 months) were randomly allocated into three tannin treatments (0, 0. 8 and 1. 6 g tannin/kg BW) and drenched for a day. In Exp. 3, 26 sheep (11 males and 15 females aged 9 - 18 months) were divided into three groups of 9, 9, and 8 sheep each. These groups were drenched with 1. 6 g tannins/kg BW/day; once, twice or thrice for the 3 groups respectively. For the three experiments, EPG and L 3 larvae were counted in individual feacal samples. For all tannin treatments, EPG decreased (P< 0. 05) over time. Though the differences among tannin levels and frequencies varied (P< 0. 05) over time, EPG consistently decreased with increasing tannin level and frequency. Thus 1. 6 and 2. 4 g tannin /kg BW for 3 consecutive days had nearly similar effects on the EPG. The results of this study are rather inconclusive that weather conditions such as rainfall had a direct effect on internal parasites development. Nematode parasites at Ukulinga Research Farm were resistant to the commercial anthelmintics used. Drenching with 1. 6 g wattle tannin/kg BW over three successive days is enough to reduce EPG and reduce the degree of pasture contamination...|$|E
