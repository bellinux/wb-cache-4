5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> the action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is {{commonly referred to as}} direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{assimilation}} {{took place in}} Maharashtra, where a regional deity named Khandoba is a patron deity of farming and herding castes. The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in Jejuri. Khandoba has been assimilated {{as a form of}} Shiva himself, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> he is worshipped {{in the form of a}} lingam. Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with Surya and Karttikeya.|$|E
5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> Set takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E

While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> one claps as the character exits.|$|E

A small number of separate statutory offences have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary offences, in <b>which</b> <b>case,</b> usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics.

Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in <b>which</b> <b>case</b> sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
