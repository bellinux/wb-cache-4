5|$|A {{graduate}} of the St Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety {{with a series of}} ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout, Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son – <b>which</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. Prokofiev's greatest interest, however, was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel. Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges, composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} Romanian units left the UNR {{and headed for}} Kishinev, where a Romanian-friendly Moldavian Democratic Republic was vying for power with the local Bolsheviks.

The volunteers had dressed as Russian {{soldiers}} during their passage to Iași, but were recognized as Romanian units by the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops garrisoned in Kishinev City Station, where their train stopped on January 6. A skirmish followed, with the Moldavians and Bolsheviks either disarming, or killing or kidnapping Corps soldiers. The survivors were held captive {{in the same place}} as Moldavian Army founder Gherman Pântea, and were released later that day, allegedly by Republican troops. Years later, suspicion arose that Pântea had in fact helped the Bolsheviks, as an alleged enemy of Romanian interests in Bessarabia.|$|E
