500|$|The Deutschland {{class was}} a series of three Panzerschiffe ("armored ships"), a form of heavily armed cruiser, built by the Reichsmarine officially in {{accordance}} with restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The ships of the class, , [...] and , were all stated to displace [...] in accordance with the Treaty, though they actually displaced [...] at standard displacement. Despite violating the <b>weight</b> <b>limitation,</b> the design for the ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight. They were the first major warships to use welding and all-diesel propulsion. Due to their heavy armament of six [...] guns, the British began referring to the vessels as [...] "pocket battleships". The Deutschland-class ships were initially classified as Panzerschiffe or [...] "armored ships", but the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940.|$|E

50|$|All of the Runners have a {{specific}} <b>weight</b> <b>limitation,</b> and can have their weapons, shield generator and engines interchanged and removed based around this limit. Each of the runners has a primary weapon mount, and one or more secondary weapon mounts, along with a shield and generator bay.

Secondary mounts are singular and weapons can be grouped, single, or alternately fired independent of the primary guns.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main {{restrictions}} on the bridge. There is a 3 ST <b>weight</b> <b>limitation,</b> a 7 ft height restriction, {{and there is a}} limit on how wide vehicles can be.

5000|$|The term is a subjective, {{visually}} determined {{concept that}} does not have an explicit lower or upper <b>weight</b> <b>limitation,</b> and may denote women who may be considered barely overweight to those who are morbidly obese. A 2009 study found that male fat admirers preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted more positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes [...] "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that FAs are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".|$|E

50|$|Blue Sky II UAV is a {{development}} of earlier Type I, {{and performance of}} both UAVs {{is very similar to}} each other. Type I UAV is an unmanned helicopter in conventional helicopter layout, and the landing gear system consists of a pair of skids. Type II UAV is a modified Type I UAV specially designed for industrial / engineering applications by redesigning the location of payloads. By relocating the location of payload under the nose in Type I to directly under the belly, payload of Type II UAV is on the same axis of the main rotor, so for Type I, the <b>weight</b> <b>limitation</b> of the payload can be altered anytime, thus making Type II UAV very adaptable for various missions of industrial and engineering applications. Type II UAV is powered by an 80 cc Komatsu gasoline engine.|$|E

25|$|Fabrication of {{finished}} loudspeaker {{systems has}} become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and <b>weight</b> <b>limitations.</b> High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 {{or more per}} pair. Economical mass market speaker systems and drivers available for much lower costs may be manufactured in China or other low-cost manufacturing locations.|$|R
50|$|The ACN-PCN system {{provides}} a standardised international airplane/pavement rating system replacing the various S, T, TT, LCN, AUW, ISWL, etc., rating systems throughout the world. In 1981 ICAO promulgated the ACN-PCN method {{as the single}} universal system for determining the <b>weight</b> <b>limitation</b> of aircraft operating on airport pavements by a procedure of comparing an airport’s PCN with an ACN. To avoid accelerated deterioration and excessive maintenance costs and for the safeguarding of pavement integrity and assurance of optimum service life ICAO utilises the ACN /PCN load classification method for reporting pavement strength. According to this worldwide standard, aircraft can safely operate on a pavement if their ACN is {{less than or equal}} to the pavement load bearing capacity or PCN. An aircraft having an ACN equal to or less than the PCN can operate without weight restrictions on a pavement.|$|E
50|$|Depending upon {{air density}} and the jumper’s total weight, the parachute’s {{average rate of}} descent is from 22 to 24 ft/s; total {{suspended}} <b>weight</b> <b>limitation</b> is 360 lb. The parachute is deployed using either a 15 or 20 ft static line, allowing the parachutist to be delivered by either C-130 or C-17 aircraft. The T-10D main parachute is a parabolic-shape and has a nominal diameter of 35 ft with 30 suspension lines. The entire assembly weighs 31 lb. Paratroopers can be dropped from an aircraft at a maximum speed of 173 mph, at a minimum of 500 ft. Maximum jump wind speed is 15 mph. The T-10D Parachute assembly consists of five components: pack tray, troop harness, deployment bag, risers, and canopy. The parachute has a combined service life of 16.5 years; service life is 12 years and shelf life is 4.5 years. The T-10D Parachute must be repacked every 120 days. The T-10D Parachute is made of nylon materials commonly used in the manufacturing of parachutes.|$|E
50|$|Horse {{racing is}} the most {{important}} recreation in Bandar Torkaman which takes place in the spring and autumn. The competition is held in the main racing field which is about 100 hectares in size. The horse racing competition in Bandar Torkaman has many admirers in the country, especially in Tehran and Gonbade Kavoos. Even fans from the Persian Gulf States visit Bandar Torkaman to watch the races. One of the favorite sports among the Turkmans is the traditional Goorehesh wrestling in which two rivals wrestle with each other without age or <b>weight</b> <b>limitation.</b> They take hold of each other's belt and the one who succeeds to lay the rival's back on the ground is pronounced winner and receives a present called Bayraq, which is either a ram or ewe. Ram is a symbol of uprightness and bravery among Turkmans and is much respected by them. To praise the strength and valor of a youth, he is said to resemble a ram.|$|E

50|$|The term {{is applied}} to muddy road {{conditions}} in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, which are caused by the poor drainage of underlying clay-laden soils found in the region. Roads are subject to <b>weight</b> <b>limitations</b> and closures during the period in certain districts of the Russian Federation. The phenomenon was a hindrance {{in the early part}} of the 20th Century in the Soviet Union, when 40% of rural villages were not served by paved roads.|$|R
5000|$|In 1935, {{congress}} passed the Motor Carrier Act, which replaced the code of competition and authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate the trucking industry. [...] Based on recommendations given by the now-abolished ICC, Congress enacted the first hours of service regulations in 1938, limiting the driving hours of truck and bus drivers. In 1941, the ICC reported that inconsistent <b>weight</b> <b>limitations</b> imposed by the states were a hindrance to effective interstate truck commerce.|$|R
