The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content.

The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax's symphonies released on CD, two by Chandos Records, the first conducted by Bryden Thomson (recorded 1983–88) and the second by Handley (2003); between them was a cycle issued by Naxos Records conducted by David Lloyd-Jones (recorded 1997–2001). The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded, {{many of them in}} several different versions. Bax's chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata.

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests {{a relationship between}} technology use and self-esteem. Such research has failed to consider young school-aged children and {{their use of the}} internet, particularly across contexts. Thirty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years rated the level and nature of their internet use (email, instant message, play games, visit <b>websites)</b> <b>at</b> home, school and in the community (i. e., at someone else’s house). They also rated items that measured home, school and peer self-esteem. Instant messaging at school explained 21 % of the differences in school self-esteem. As children tended to report instant messaging at school, they also tended to report the highest school-based self-esteem. Instant messaging at someone else’s house explained 11 % of the differences in home self-esteem. As children tended to report instant messaging at someone else’s house, they also tended to report the lowest home self-esteem. Visiting <b>websites</b> <b>at</b> someone else’s house explained 10 % of the differences in peer self-esteem. As children tended to report visiting <b>websites</b> <b>at</b> someone else’s house, they also tended to report the highest peer self-esteem.
