[...] Land Rover was the successful candidate and the Australian Army ordered several thousand 110 Land Rovers in various configurations made to this specification, called the Land Rover Perentie, {{some of which were}} 6x6 drive. Six wheel drive Perenties were fitted with a turbocharged 3.9L Isuzu diesel engine (4BD1-T), while the 4x4 versions were powered by the naturally aspirated variant (4BD1). The Australian Army vehicles were assembled at the Jaguar Rover Australia (JRA) facility at Moorebank, NSW, from locally made components and other components from the UK and Japan. Between 1981 and 1990, the Isuzu 4BD1 engine was the only diesel option available for Land Rover in Australia. [...] All 110 cab chassis Defenders sold in Australia during this time had a wheelbase of 120 inches in order to accommodate an 8ft x 6ft tray. A small number of 6x6 cab chassis Defenders were also made by JRA during this time.While the Land Rover has been in use in the Australian military from 1959, as a consumer product from the 1970s, it fell out of favour as a 4x4 <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> while offerings from Toyota and Nissan increased in popularity. [...] Mid-2009, Land Rover expanded the model range to include 110 and 130 cab-chassis, panel van and HCPU versions, and late in the year announced the re-introduction of the 90 4x4 model for sale from early 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Lone {{families}} or single parent families are incredibly susceptible to poverty in Canada, {{especially those who}} reside in rural areas. Although single male parent families are at risk, families with a woman as the only parent are at a much greater risk. [...] Women who are raising their families on their own are at a huge risk for poverty among Canada. Women in rural Canada are at disadvantage for employment opportunities {{due to the lack}} of jobs within the community. Formal education is also a challenge for rural women because of the general low income status and high cost of education. Without formal education, rural women often cannot find good paying jobs that provide stability and benefits to support their families. In order to find affordable housing for a single parent income, one must often look outside of town to more remote areas. Although housing is cheaper, the employment opportunities decrease; causing women to look for employment closer to town or within the community. By having to travel to <b>work,</b> <b>vehicle</b> costs or alternative transportation costs are increased. Wages in rural Canada are lower than those in urban areas, which contributes to the overall lower income and poor income status among these families. For women supporting a family, the poor wages, low employment rate, high cost of living and lack of financial support are the risk factors in which increase the incidence of poverty among this population. [...] This creates a huge expense for travel and transportation, as well as child care. If the children in the family attend school, transportation to school is often limited to those residing in remote areas. Providing or paying for alternative transportation for children to attend school is also an additional cost.|$|E

This issue was examined by surveying 204 people who drive for work purposes, from four different organisations. It was predicted that work-related drivers would report more unsafe driving behaviours in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> in comparison to their personal vehicle. In support of this prediction, the participants reported higher crash involvement rates in their <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> (per kilometre travelled) than their personal vehicle. The participants were also less likely to engage in vehicle checking practices in their <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> compared with their personal vehicle. Contrary to prediction, participants reported that they were less likely to speed or engage in dangerous driving in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> than their personal vehicle. There was also {{some evidence}} that the fleet safety policies and practices in place within each organisation had a positive impact on driver behaviour.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a broad investigation of work-related road safety in South Australia in three distinct parts. In the first part, {{a review of}} national and international literature on work-related road safety is conducted. The second part {{presents a}}n analysis on the burden of work-related light vehicle crashes in South Australia for the years 2006 to 2010. Three separate methods of identifying <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> that were involved in South Australia crashes were utilised. Each of the methods identified {{a particular set of}} <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> which were then analysed separately. Despite this, the results from each method were reasonably consistent. Compared to non-work vehicles, the crash involved <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{were more likely to be}} newer, travel during daytime hours on weekdays, and be driven by males of working age. A large proportion of the <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> were found to consist of commercial-type vehicles such as utilities, vans, and station wagons, which are less likely to be fitted with safety features that are common on other light vehicles. Another finding was that <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> that crashed in the greater Adelaide metropolitan area between 6 am and 7 pm on a weekday while being driven by a person younger than 65, had a higher crash risk than non-work vehicles. No definitive reason for the increased crash risk could be identified. In the third part of the report, an analysis of the crash and injury experience of a large government light vehicle fleet in South Australia is presented. Information on the safety features of each vehicle that entered the government fleet between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2010 were obtained, along with details on crash involvement and total travel distance. Within the government fleet, the uptake of safety features over time was similar to that of the general vehicle fleet and even greater for some features such as electronic stability control and traction control. Analysis of the crash data (while controlling for total travel distance) revealed that the crash rate of the government fleet had reduced over time. With respect to the different safety features installed on each vehicle, it was found that those vehicles that were equipped with ESC or had a 5 -star ANCAP safety rating had a statistically significantly lower crash rate compared to those that were not.

40|$|Copyright: Elsevier The {{available}} {{evidence suggests that}} people who drive for work purposes engage in less safe driving practices than other drivers. The study examined this issue by surveying 204 people who drive for work purposes, in four different vehicle fleets. It was predicted that work-related drivers would report a higher intention to speed in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> than their personal vehicle. Additionally, the constructs within the Theory of Planned Behaviour, along with anticipated regret, were used to predict intentions to speed in the two settings. Contrary to prediction, the participants reported a lower intention to speed, t (201) = 4. 19, p <. 001, in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> than their personal vehicle. Further analysis revealed that the intentions of drivers in the two settings were significantly different in relation to anticipated regret, t (201) = 4. 84, p <. 001 and subjective norms, t (201) = 4. 02, p <. 001.
