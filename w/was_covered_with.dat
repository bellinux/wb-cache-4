5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E

The entire station was designed in vibrant colors: the platforms <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> colored granite tiles and the walls have panels of circular red mosaic designs set on white tiles. The walls behind the panels <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a light blue mosaic.|$|R
5000|$|Bar Riviera is 44 km {{long and}} has got 9 km of beaches. There {{are more than}} 20 beaches but Bar has got 2 beaches on the lakeside. The most famous beach in Bar is Sutomore beach. It's 1 km long and <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> sand. Canj beach is 1 km long and is a very popular {{location}} for tourists. The beach <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fine sand but the sea bottom <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> round rocky pebbles. Queen's beach is very near Canj {{but it can be}} only approached from sea. Red beach is specific because it <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> read round pebbles and view from it is outstanding. Zukotrlica beach is over 1 km long and it is near the city. It <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> white pebbles and in the background is little beautiful pine forest. Beach Utjeha is also called [...] "Olive Bay" [...] because there are hundreds of olives in the background. It <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> pebbles and <b>is</b> very clear. On the lake there are two beaches: Pjesacac and Murici. They <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> pebbles. The view from there on the Skadar Lake is amazing.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} has undergone various extensions and alterations {{since it was}} built. The {{building has}} a T shaped plan with the west projecting wing being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. The roof <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> slate from local quarries until it was thatched in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles {{were used in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the park, Minnehaha Falls, lies several {{thousand}} feet upstream from its original mouth where it emptied into the Mississippi River 10,000 {{years ago at the}} end of the last Great Ice Age. Erosion below the falls has exposed Minnesota's geologic past from the present day back to over 450 million years ago, when Minnesota <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the {{mausoleum}} is under reconstruction. More than 10,000 sq. meters of its territory <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> asphalt and a 4,000,400 linear meter territory <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> colorful sidewalk tiles.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the rainy}} season, the sky <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> clouds and black clouds <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> clouds. In {{the rest of}} the year, the sky is dry with clear or {{slightly}} cloudy clouds ...|$|R
50|$|Cords {{running across}} the floor should <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a {{suitable}} device {{to protect them from}} physical damage. However, they should never <b>be</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a rug or carpet, as this can produce a serious fire hazard.|$|R
5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza. The tomb {{contained}} rich offerings of jadeite, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.|$|E
5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species. Horse bones {{from this time}} period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> unpalatable plants.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body <b>was</b> <b>covered,</b> <b>with</b> long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E
50|$|The {{side walls}} of sanctum sanctorim where heavily {{decorated}} with large brass sheets with statutes of gods and goddess, while the roof <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> copper sheets, while the entrances of sanctum sanctorium <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> gold sheets.|$|R
50|$|It {{is made of}} {{a hollow}} wooden trunk covered at both sides with animal skin. The left side <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a thicker skin {{producing}} flat sound whereas the right side <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> thinner skin producing sharper sound.|$|R
50|$|The islands <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> tundra vegetation, shingle and ice. The sea {{around these}} Islands <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fast {{ice in the}} winter and the climate is severe. The {{surrounding}} sea is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer.|$|R
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, {{the right side of the}} skull also <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E
5000|$|Roofs in Scandinavia have {{probably}} <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> birch bark and sod since prehistory. During the Viking and Middle Ages most houses had sod roofs. [...] Churches and other buildings <b>with</b> steeper roofs <b>were</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> boards, wood shingles, or lead.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{flanks of}} the San Martin Tuxtla and Santa Marta volcanoes <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> the neo{{tropical}} Sierra de los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest ecoregion, of the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Biome.

5|$|The Mosquito {{conducted}} a reconnaissance sortie over Kaafjord {{on the afternoon}} of 15 September, arriving at about 1:30pm GMT. Its crew found that the fjord <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> cloud and smoke. They could only briefly see Tirpitz, but reported that no damage was evident to the battleship, which remained afloat. The Mosquito conducted further reconnaissance sorties on 16 September, but the fjord was completely obscured on all occasions. McMullen considered launching a second attack, but decided against doing so as only two Tallboys and one load of JW mines were available.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> fur as thick {{as that of a}} snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> grey down. The young bird took {{only two or}} three weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
25|$|I {{have found}} the land good all along, the banks being flooded in some places.

All the islands, too, <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> cypresses, oaks, and other trees.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the area}} around these {{mountain}} villages <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> trees. Peaks <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> evergreen trees including pine, walnut, oak and maple trees. Herbs, shrubs, wild flowers and thorny bushes {{can be seen in}} abundance. Goats and other pet animals graze the pastures.|$|R
50|$|The {{floors are}} {{finished}} with a pale green vinyl tile, however much of the nave floor has <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a dark blue carpet. The floor of the sanctuary was {{finished with a}} cream marbled tile, which has also <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a cream carpet.|$|R
5|$|The tank used in {{the film}} is a {{modified}} M5A1 Stuart. It was purchased from the government of Peru about twelve years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for Tank Girl, the tank's 37mm anti-tank gun <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a modified flag pole to {{give the appearance of}} a 105mm gun. An entire 1969 Cadillac Eldorado was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the fender welded to the front.|$|E
5|$|To {{the same}} generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily {{be taken to}} pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time {{acquired}} arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, {{as well as the}} most, ancient, English chair is that made {{at the end of the}} 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> gilded gesso which long since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> bogs and wild bush.|$|E
50|$|The western {{portion of}} the {{district}} is higher. The uplands either bare or <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> scrub jungle of Zizyphus and other thorny shrubs. This thorny forest gradually merges into sal (Shorea robusta) forest. Low hills <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Miliusa, Schleichera, Diospyros and other trees.|$|R
