5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States, but the position went to Rex E. Lee, to Scalia's great disappointment. Scalia was offered {{a seat on the}} Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.|$|E

25|$|The tax cuts, recession, and {{increases}} in outlays all contributed to record budget deficits during the Bush administration. The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of US$374 billion in 2003 and US$413 billion in 2004. National debt, the cumulative total of yearly deficits, rose from US$5.7 trillion (58% of GDP) to US$8.3 trillion (67% of GDP) under Bush, {{as compared to the}} US$2.7 trillion total debt owed <b>when</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> left office, which was 52% of the GDP.|$|E

50|$|The metrification {{assessment}} board existed from 1975 to 1982, ending <b>when</b> President <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> abolished it, {{largely on}} the recommendation of Frank Mankiewicz and Lyn Nofziger.

25|$|But Carter's choice {{had only}} just been made <b>when</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> won the {{presidency}} and set about re-examining the MX plans. In October 1981 they announced MX deployment would be sped up, cancelling the MPS basing and recommending the missiles temporarily be placed in existing Titan II and Minuteman silos until a final solution could be decided on. Work on LoADS continued, in and June 1982 was renamed Sentry. The program was told {{to be prepared to}} go into production on short notice.|$|E
25|$|Another Reagan legacy was the {{expansion}} of Alternative Minimum Tax. <b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the AMT was expanded to target middle class deductions related to having children, owning a home, or living in high tax states. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report highlighted the AMT as the single most serious problem with the tax code. The advocate noted that {{the complexity of the}} AMT leads to most taxpayers who owe AMT not realizing it until preparing their returns or being notified by the IRS.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E

25|$|King {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the years after her husband's 1968 assassination when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the Women's Movement. King founded the King Center and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. King finally succeeded <b>when</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> signed legislation which established Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. She later broadened her scope to include both opposition to apartheid and advocacy for LGBT rights. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, most notably John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Robert F. Kennedy. John F. Kennedy's phone call to her during the 1960 election was what she liked to believe was behind his victory.|$|E
500|$|An early {{example of}} the First Lady's {{protective}} nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President's [...] "close friend", presumably to acquire media attention. Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave. While the President recuperated in the hospital, the First Lady slept {{with one of his}} shirts to be comforted by the scent. <b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him back to the White House.|$|E

O'Connor was later joined on the Court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg would be joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were successfully appointed to the Court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by Barack Obama. The only other woman to be nominated to the Court was Harriet Miers, whose nomination to succeed O'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire.|$|E

500|$|Moore briefly {{supported}} the Liberal Party in the 1950s, though condemned the Liberal Democrats, saying he believed they could alter their position radically {{and that they}} [...] "would happily join up with the BNP or the Socialist Workers Party... if [...] they could win a few extra votes." [...] He admired the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and was briefly their financial adviser. He wrote in his autobiography that Liechtenstein – a constitutional monarchy headed by a prince – had the best political system in the world.

He was a patron of the British Weights and Measures Association.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{became the}} First Lady of the United States <b>when</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> was inaugurated as {{president}} in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated {{her desire to}} create a more suitable [...] "first home" [...] in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having [...] "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [...] beaten up floors"; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW.

This was back <b>when</b> (<b>Ronald)</b> <b>Reagan</b> was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E

500|$|In particular, Soviet–First World {{relations}} deteriorated {{when the}} US President Jimmy Carter, following {{the advice of}} his National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, denounced the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see Soviet–Afghan relations) and described it as the [...] "most serious danger to peace since 1945". The United States stopped all grain export to the Soviet Union and persuaded US athletes not to enter the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union responded by boycotting the next Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. The détente policy collapsed. <b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> succeeded Carter as US president in 1981, he promised a sharp increase in US defense spending and a more aggressively anti-Soviet foreign policy. This caused alarm in Moscow, with the Soviet media accusing him of [...] "warmongering" [...] and [...] "mistakenly believing that stepping up the arms race will bring peace to the world". General Nikolai Ogarkov also commented that too many Soviet citizens had begun believing that any war was bad and peace at any price was good, and that better political education was necessary to inculcate a [...] "class" [...] point of view in world affairs.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{historian}} Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University (who {{was opposed}} to repealing the amendment), [...] "ever since 1985, <b>when</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> was serving {{in his second term}} as president, there have been repeated attempts to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution, which limits each president to two terms." [...] In early 1989, during an exit interview with Tom Brokaw of NBC, President Reagan stated his intention to fight for the amendment's repeal. However, after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, his post-presidential ambitions had to be scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|The {{downfall}} {{of the regime}} is attributed to its embezzlement {{of millions of dollars}} in foreign aid that was given to the country in response to the devastating 1972 earthquake. [...] Many moderate supporters of the dictatorship began abandoning it in the face of growing revolutionary sentiment. [...] The Sandinista (FSLN) movement organized relief, began to expand its influence and assumed the leadership of the revolution. A popular uprising brought the FSLN to power in 1979. [...] The United States had long been opposed to the socialist FSLN, and after the revolution the Carter administration moved quickly to support the Somocistas with financial and material aid. [...] <b>When</b> <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> took office, he augmented the direct support to an anti-Sandinista group, called the Contras, which included factions loyal to the former dictatorship. [...] When Congress prohibited further funding to the Contras, Oliver North continued the funding through arms sales that were also prohibited by Congress.|$|E
