5|$|Gray's Inn, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Inns of Court, became {{noted for}} {{the parties and}} festivals it hosted. Students {{performed}} masques and plays in court weddings, in front of Queen Elizabeth herself, and hosted regular festivals and banquets at Candlemas, All Hallows Eve and Easter. At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the Prince of Purpoole, and organising a masque entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the dodo was {{assigned}} the genus Didus, now a junior synonym of Raphus. In 1848, {{a new species}} within the now defunct genus Didus, D. nazarenus, was named by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville. To house their new species, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> species known at the time, Strickland and Melville named the subfamily Didinae. In 1893 three species {{were assigned to the}} group Pezophaps solitarius, Didus ineptus, and the possible species Didus borbonicus. Today, only two raphine species are known, with Didus ineptus becoming a junior subjective synonym of Raphus cucullatus; Didus? borbonicus now classified as the ibis Threskiornis solitarius; and Didus nazarenus being identified as synonymous with Pezophaps solitarius.|$|E
30|$|There is an optimum minimum {{point on}} the EVM curve where the SNR is maximized. EVM deteriorates with high input power levels due to the {{compression}} of the first LNA. At low signal levels, thermal noise limits the available SNR. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  14 that three Rxs (2, 8, and 5) do not perform <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{compared}} {{the effect of}} using word vectors generated with the hyperspace analogue to language, a neural language model, and the skip-gram model. The neural language model is clearly the best suited for the task, being especially useful for providing knowledge about out-of-vocabulary words. SG vectors come a little behind, while HAL vectors do not perform <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Equestrian tournament {{was held}} {{for the first time}} in the year 1964 in Požarevac [...]One of the reason for {{founding}} was orientation to tourism since in 1951 Ljubicevo stopped being military stable.Nowadays Equestrian tournament is held in the first weekend in September and they are preceded by official parade and carnival through the center of Požarevac, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> coultural events.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Barrowman has portrayed Malcolm Merlyn, one of {{the main}} antagonists in the CW series Arrow. Barrowman was a {{recurring}} cast member for the first two seasons and was promoted to a main cast member beginning with the third season. By July 2016, he signed a deal that allows him to continue being a series regular on Arrow as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> superhero shows produced by Greg Berlanti, including The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow. On May 2017, Barrowman announced that he is leaving the Arrowverse television franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Angry Dad {{internet}} cartoon, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> internet cartoons in the episode, {{were originally}} {{going to be}} animated using Macromedia Flash, however, the department of Film Roman that handled Flash animation {{would not be able}} to complete the scenes in time. Because of this, director Sheetz had to draw the scenes himself, mimicking the look of Flash animation. At the end of Bart's trap, Homer falls into a pool of green paint, making him resemble the Hulk. Selman originally wanted Homer to fall into blue paint, since the blue paint mixed with his yellow skin would make green, however the idea never came to fruition.|$|E
50|$|Microhydro {{systems are}} limited mainly by {{characteristics}} of the site. The most direct limitation comes from small sources with minuscule flow. Likewise, flow can fluctuate seasonally in some areas. Lastly, though perhaps the foremost disadvantage is {{the distance from the}} power source to the site in need of energy. This distributional issue <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are key when considering using a microhydro system.|$|R
50|$|Many {{particularities}} {{are shared}} with <b>the</b> Crișana dialect <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> neighboring Transylvanian varieties, and some with the Moldavian dialect.|$|R

5|$|The scene {{changes to}} the Turkish city of Istanbul ten years later. The game's protagonist, a devoted junior clerk at the Istanbul offices of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, Antoinette Marceau, {{receives}} instructions from her employer Marcel Bouc, the Director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, {{to attend to the}} wishes of his good friend Hercule Poirot. He tasks Marceau with ensuring that Poirot's journey on the Orient Express is favourable. Marceau begins her adventure in Sirkeci Terminal, Istanbul, where she becomes acquainted with Poirot, whom she admires, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> characters who later accompany her aboard the Orient Express.|$|E
5|$|This replica is now {{in storage}} (in the airport area) after being {{displayed}} at the Toronto International Centre (across the road from where the actual aircraft were built) for a technology trade show that ran from 30 September to 4 October 2013. The future plans for the replica as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> remaining aircraft in the now closed CASM is still up in the air. The museum is seeking a location near Pearson International Airport, {{so that it can}} display some time in 2015, all of its artifacts including a partly restored Avro Lancaster bomber.|$|E
5|$|McCauley {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1955 New Year Honours. In October 1956, he gave a {{presentation}} on air power concepts that was attended by Prime Minister Menzies, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Australian service chiefs. McCauley identified Malaya and Indochina, particularly Vietnam, as likely areas for future RAAF deployments, advocating a continued presence in Singapore in view of its strategic importance to the defence of Australia, as he had witnessed first-hand during World WarII. He also recommended that a supersonic light bomber replace the straight-winged and obsolescent English Electric Canberra, primarily for interdiction in Southeast Asia. McCauley's tenure as CAS saw {{the beginning of a}} trend for the RAAF to equip with US aircraft types in preference to British types, with recommendations being put forward for the F-104 Starfighter (though in the event the French Dassault MirageIII was purchased) and C-130 Hercules. This stemmed partly from his inspection of Allied air force units during the Korean War, when he observed that those employing American hardware were far better served with spare parts and replacement aircraft than those with British equipment. Some of his senior commanders had urged replacing the Canberra with Avro Vulcan heavy bombers, but McCauley did not pursue this option, preferring to concentrate in the short term on new fighter technology. He also made a point of supporting the Australian aircraft industry wherever feasible.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{unlike the}} first game, the player {{is allowed to}} use most every {{character}} that he unlocks, in <b>the</b> main story <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> modes.|$|R
50|$|Naze Port is a {{regional}} transportation hub, with frequent ferry service to Kagoshima, Tokyo, Kobe, and Osaka, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> Okinawa, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Amami islands, and Tokara Islands.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{noted that the}} X {{chromosome}} was special in 1890 by Hermann Henking in Leipzig. [...] Henking was studying the testicles of Pyrrhocoris and noticed that one chromosome did not take part in meiosis. [...] Chromosomes are so named because {{of their ability to}} take up staining. [...] Although the X chromosome could be stained just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> Henking was unsure whether it was a different class of object and consequently named it X element, which later became X chromosome after it was established that it was indeed a chromosome.|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} 1804 dollars (as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> coins for the sets) were struck in November 1834. Soon, Roberts' trip was {{expanded}} to Indo-China (then known as Annam) and Japan, so two additional sets were struck. The pieces struck {{under the auspices}} of the Mint are known as Class I 1804 dollars, and eight of that type are known to exist today. Roberts left for his trip in April 1835, and he presented one set each to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam. The gift to the Sultan of Muscat was part of an exchange of diplomatic gifts that resulted in the Sultan presenting the Washington Zoo with a full-grown lion and lioness. Roberts fell ill in Bangkok and was taken to Macao, where he died in June 1835. Following Roberts' death, the remaining two sets were returned to the Mint without being presented to the dignitaries.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 {{if there are no}} carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in {{a relatively short period of}} time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

50|$|Asuka {{was once}} a movie actress, but was demoted to Kiri Pro. Komugi thinks it's an honor to have a {{professional}} actor working with her, but in reality it means Asuka is close to losing her job as an actress. Asuka works hard at her job at Kiri Pro, and is usually more responsible than Komugi or Megumi. She doesn't complain much, but can lose her temper just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Kiri Pro employees, Asuka respects Komugi and forms a friendship with her. In Magikarte Z, it is revealed that Asuka hates Osaka with quite a passion.|$|R
2500|$|Farber's book, How to Learn any Language never {{specifies}} {{all of the}} 25 languages {{that his}} publicity materials say he has studied.
