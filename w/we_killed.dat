500|$|The {{tribes of}} Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed {{thousands}} of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia {{to assist the}} royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime. The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said [...] "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. <b>We</b> <b>killed</b> the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Al-Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying [...] "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser.

500|$|On 19 September 1942, U-156 {{was roughly}} [...] south of Freetown {{and the crew}} was still {{repairing}} minor damage, when the lookout spotted a ship at 04:30. The target was the British ship Quebec City, en route from Cape Town to Freetown. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position and hit Quebec City with one torpedo fired from tube VI. Hartenstein surfaced and approached the lifeboats and asked the survivors for the ship's name. Quebec City did not sink easily and U-156 fired 58 rounds from the 37mm (1.46in) flak gun and seven further shots from the 10.5cm gun before Hartenstein ordered a cease fire. After a direct hit in the ship's stern ammunition magazine and an explosion, Quebec City slowly sank. According to William Clark, a member of Quebec Citys crew, Hartenstein made sure that the survivors had enough water and provisions and that Captain William Thomas had the exact coordinates. This account of that attack and {{the impression that the}} humanitarian actions of Hartenstein made is documented in the book by David Cledlyn Jones, The Enemy <b>We</b> <b>Killed,</b> My Friend. Jones himself disagrees, stating that Hartenstein was concerned about the survivors’ well-being but did not inquire about provisions, nor did he offer additional food or water. Hartenstein did express {{that it would have been}} his wish to tow them at least some distance to the African coast, but explained that he was not able to do so as he recently had been attacked while attempting to aid survivors.|$|E

2500|$|In Budapest, Prónay {{installed}} {{his unit}} in the Hotel Britannia, where the group swelled to battalion size. Their program of vicious attacks continued; they planned a citywide pogrom against the Jews until Horthy found out and {{put a stop to}} it. In his diary, Prónay reported that Horthy:reproached me for the many Jewish corpses found in the various parts of the country, especially in the Transdanubia. This, he emphasized, gave the foreign press extra ammunitions against us. He told me that we should stop harassing small Jews; instead, we should kill some big (Kun government) Jews such as Somogyi or Vázsonyi – these people deserve punishment much more... in vain, I tried to convince him that the liberal papers would be against us anyway, and it did not matter that <b>we</b> <b>killed</b> only one Jew or <b>we</b> <b>killed</b> them allThe degree of Horthy's responsibility for the excesses of Prónay is disputed. On several occasions, Horthy reached out to stop Prónay from a particularly excessive burst of anti-Jewish cruelty, and the Jews of Pest went on record absolving Horthy of the White Terror as early as the fall of 1919, when they released a statement disavowing the Kun revolution and blaming the terror on a few units within the National Army. Horthy has never been found to have personally engaged in White Terror atrocities. [...] But his American biographer, Thomas L. Sakmyster, concluded that he [...] "tacitly supported the right wing officer detachments" [...] who carried out the terror; Horthy called them [...] "my best men". The admiral also had practical reasons for overlooking the terror his officers wrought, since he needed the dedicated officers to help stabilize the country. Nevertheless, it was at least another year before the terror died down. In the summer of 1920, Horthy's government took measures to rein in and eventually disperse the reactionary battalions. Prónay managed to undermine these measures, but only for a short time. Prónay was put on trial for extorting a wealthy Jewish politician, and for [...] "insulting the President of the Parliament" [...] by trying to cover up the extortion. Found guilty on both charges, Prónay was now a liability and an embarrassment. His command was revoked, and he was denounced as a common criminal {{on the floor of the}} Hungarian parliament.|$|E
