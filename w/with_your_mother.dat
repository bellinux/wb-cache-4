500|$|Sady Doyle {{reasoned}} that Bush {{was hard to}} dislike due to her adopting [...] "the least partisan causes" [...] such as literacy and breast cancer, which would attract the support of most Americans and her coming off as a [...] "mild, polite, ordinary woman who might go to church <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> or organize suburban potlucks." [...] Doyle furthered that her statements were never enough to offend others and the harshest criticism that could be bestowed upon her {{was that she was}} boring.|$|E
60|$|Supposing you danced <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> Henry. I can see {{her toes}} itching inside her black satin slippers.|$|E
60|$|HILLCRIST. I don't {{interfere}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> in such matters. She may go {{and call}} on the devil himself if she likes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fine {{talking for}} young things,' said Mrs. Hazleby; 'besides, {{it is nothing}} to you, you three elder ones will be well enough off <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> fortune.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Spyers is very well. Very busy of course, {{and very}} much delighted <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> gifts to the church. All her own work, isn't it, Nuttie?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] began Mary, [...] "if he's coming <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> consent, {{and if you}} haven't quarreled, and it is {{not broken}} off, I should think you'd be just delighted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Henry {{is going}} to drive home <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> and I suggest that they should put us down half-way and let us walk back." ...|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Well, call away. What have I {{to account}} for? Had you {{a hard time}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> Why didnt she ask me for money? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{can stay}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> for the present, and then, if you like, {{you can join}} me at my house in Città di Castello.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Choose, my son,' said she. 'Will {{you have}} the little cake <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> blessing, or the big one without it, in that you have set aside your father and taken on {{yourself}} to make a vow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! 'tis {{all very}} well!" [...] {{observed}} the maiden lady, drawing herself up. [...] "But these things {{must have come}} to you <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> blood. I never knew a Pyncheon that had any turn for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am giving nobody away," [...] I replied firmly. [...] "Of {{course there}} were certain {{troubles}} to be got over in connection <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> presence to-day. You remember her saying, for instance, that she would break every bottle of wine she found being served?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your name is Dan Phillips, isn't it?" [...] he said irrelevantly, [...] "and {{you live}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> the Widow Phillips, down there at Carleton Corners, I understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{is in the}} drawing-room <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I said I {{would send}} you.' Poor Miss Headworth gasped with agitation. 'Oh! where's Mr. Dutton--not that {{anything}} can be done--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't quite sympathise <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{in all her}} {{feelings}} about this marriage, because I {{do not think that}} I recognise as she does the necessity of money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} so now," [...] he remarked, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you will say to me presently. What I am doing now, Ella, I am doing <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sanction, and you must {{associate}} her with the gift which I am going to place in your keeping." ...|$|R
60|$|Whatever may {{be thought}} of the genuineness or {{authority}} of {{any part of the}} book of Daniel, it makes no difference in my belief in Christianity; for Christianity is within a man, even as he is a being gifted with reason; it is associated <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> chair, and <b>with</b> the first-remembered tones of her blessed voice.|$|R
60|$|This, {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{picture and}} the bracelet, I recommend {{you to take}} on your next voyage, and to see what may result from the attempt. How considerable the sum may be which will result from this, I cannot say, but as Don Guzman's fortune was very large, I am in hopes it may prove something worth attention.|$|R
60|$|DICK. [Looking moodily at {{the paint}} pot.] I say, {{is it true}} that Maurice Lever's coming <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> I've met him playing cricket, he's rather a good sort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder that}} you kept your head at all," [...] remarked Bartol. [...] "Your youth and good, hot blood protect you. Have you talked <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> about our sitting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather," [...] I answered; [...] "if Eve doesn't mind. This is {{the night}} you promised to go <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> to a lecture somewhere, isn't it?" [...] I {{reminded}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Ned, {{they will}} think that I am {{bringing}} a court gallant <b>with</b> me. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> {{and the girls}} will be quite abashed at all this finery." ...|$|R
60|$|Alas! alone he sits, who then, Immortal among mortal men, Sat hand in {{hand with}} love, and all day through <b>With</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>mother</b> {{wondered}} over you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I used to {{be proud}} of it,' said Guy. 'I wanted to make out whether it was old Sir Hugh or the murderer of Becket, who was said to groan and turn the lock of Dark Hugh's chamber. I hunted among old papers, and a horrible story I found. That wretched Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> family--he was a courtier of Charles II, as bad or worse than any of that crew--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{very thing}} I {{want to see}} about, and talk over <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I am sure she ought to go; {{and it will not}} even be wasting time, for she cannot earn anything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{are walking}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> sister or best girl and some one passes a slighting remark or uses {{improper}} language, won't you be ashamed if you can't take her part? Well, can you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{stay here}} and play a little while," [...] said Mary Erskine to Mary Bell. [...] "I am going to talk <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> a little; but I shall be back again pretty soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] said Prince gravely. [...] "I {{only know}} that if you {{conclude}} to see Mrs. Starbottle, it will be <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> permission. Mrs. Starbottle will keep sacredly this part of the agreement, made ten years ago. But her health is very poor; and the change and country quiet of a few days may benefit her." [...] Mr. Prince bent his keen, bright eyes upon the young girl, and almost held his breath until she spoke again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your {{mother does}} not meet me with pleasure; she hears of nothing that has {{occurred}} to me <b>with</b> pride; <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> has ceased to {{take an interest in}} my welfare; and why should you be unchanged?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{the twins}} of Adlerstein! I {{remember}} me. Was {{not the other}} Adlerstein seeking an alliance <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lady <b>mother?</b> Sure no better aid could be found. He is hand and glove with young King Max." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{that we get}} {{him home}} safe," [...] said Steinar uneasily, [...] "for if not there will be trouble <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and every other woman in the land, {{to say nothing of}} Iduna the Fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} leave London, Sir Louis, and change your old mode of life. Go to Boxall Hill for a while; {{for two or}} three years or so; live <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> there and take to farming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} have thought of your home just now," [...] Fan replied. [...] "Perhaps after all you have gone through it will be {{different}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> But, Constance, may I go with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think you're wrong," [...] she said, firmly. [...] "The larger {{view is that}} of the {{scientist}} who recognizes nothing supernatural in the universe. I would not part <b>with</b> what <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> gave me for huge sums. I've had wonderful, thrilling experiences. Remember Altair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will think}} my {{question}} an odd one, I dare say," [...] said Lucy to her one day, {{as they were}} walking together from the park to the cottage--"but pray, are you personally acquainted <b>with</b> <b>your</b> sister-in-law's <b>mother,</b> Mrs. Ferrars?" ...|$|R
2500|$|I think I agree <b>with</b> <b>your</b> [...] {{order for}} reading the books more than <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's.</b> The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I {{did not know}} I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't {{think there would be}} any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|R
