5|$|Three bills {{directing}} {{that the}} battleships be sold were {{introduced into the}} Argentine National Congress {{in the summer of}} 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain's Royal Navy <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country (as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany). Italy, the Ottomans, and Greece were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro. The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign competitor, put diplomatic pressure on Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.|$|E

25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E

25|$|Swindon Town F.C. {{was also}} {{scheduled}} to appear {{as part of the}} Sky TV series Big Ron Manager in 2006, which involved former football manager Ron Atkinson acting as a troubleshooter for a club in difficulties. Filming began in December 2005 at the County Ground, with caretaker-manager Iffy Onuora in charge of Swindon at the time. The appearance of Atkinson at the club resulted in widespread press speculation that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the management of the team, which was denied. Following the disruption caused by this and the producers' wish for more backroom access, the television crew were asked to leave the club's premises in January 2006.|$|E

It led to speculations that Suazo had been sold to Argentine club Independiente. However, the deal fell through once the Argentine club refused to pay $8million for the transfer. On 4 January, Humberto called for a press conference, {{and in front of}} television cameras and news media, he acknowledged the fact that his performance and attitude wasn't positive during his first 6 months with the club, but that from now on, he was determined to change things.

Following the tragic event, Davis's brother, Geoffrey, had decided he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the Council seat running on the Democratic platform, but on election day, November 4, Geoffrey Davis lost by a large margin to James as the Working Families Party nominee.

25|$|The first {{indication}} that Bewley was anti-Semitic was in Berlin in 1921. The new Irish state {{was not yet}} formally recognised. Bewley was the Irish consul for trade.

In time he would play an important political role and {{would be the first}} Jewish Lord Mayor of Dublin. Bewley and Briscoe went to a Jewish-owned music hall in the Tauenzien Palast, but, after Briscoe left, Bewley insulted Judaism and was thrown out. There was a drunken brawl. John Chartres, the head of the Irish Bureau, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action, but the Irish Civil War broke out. Briscoe took the anti-Treaty side (which lost), while Bewley returned to Dublin, took the pro-treaty side and prosecuted anti-Treaty prisoners in the courts.|$|E

Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need {{two or three months}} to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951. Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place {{on the south side of}} the Yalu.
