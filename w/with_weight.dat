5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems <b>with</b> <b>weight</b> distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated <b>with</b> <b>weight</b> loss.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{complexity}} and the approximation of the k most vital edges (nodes) and min edge (node) blocker versions for the minimum spanning tree problem (MST). We show that the k most vital edges MST problem is NP-hard even for complete graphs <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> 0 or 1 and 3 -approximable for graphs <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> 0 or 1. We also prove that the k most vital nodes MST problem is not approximable within a factor n 1 −ϵ, for any ϵ> 0, unless NP=ZPP, even for complete graphs of order n <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> 0 or 1. Furthermore, we show that the min edge blocker MST problem is NP-hard even for complete graphs <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> 0 or 1 and that the min node blocker MST problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor 1. 36 even for graphs <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> 0 or 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of a first nontrivial eigenvalue for an asymmetric elliptic problem <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> involving the laplacian (cf. (1. 2) below) or more generally the p-laplacian (cf. (1. 3) below). A first application is given to the description of the beginning of the Fučik spectrum <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> for these operators. Another application concerns the study of nonresonance for the problems (1. 1) and (1. 5) below. One feature of our nonresonance conditions is that they involve eigenvalues <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> instead of pointwise restrictions. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated <b>with</b> <b>weight</b> gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk <b>with</b> <b>weight</b> bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E

Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line Blackglama for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line's history chosen to do so. She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products. In 2012, Jackson endorsed Nutrisystem, sponsoring their weight-loss program after struggling <b>with</b> <b>weight</b> fluctuations in the past. With the program, she donated ten million dollars in meals to the hungry. She was honored by amfAR for her contributions to AIDS research when chairing the Cinema Against AIDS gala during the Cannes Film Festival. She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help starving children. In February 2013, Jackson announced she was married to her third husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, during a private ceremony the previous year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{two families}} of weighted zero-sum constant for finite abelian groups. For a finite abelian group (G,+), {{a set of}} weights W ⊂ Z, and an integral parameter m, the m-wise Davenport constant <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> W is the smallest integer n such that each sequence over G of length n has at least m disjoint zero-subsums <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> W. And, for an integral parameter d, the d-constrained Davenport constant <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> W is the smallest n such that each sequence over G of length n has a zero-subsum <b>with</b> <b>weights</b> W of size at most d. First, we establish a link between {{these two types of}} constants and several basic and general results on them. Then, for elementary p-groups, establishing a link between our constants and the parameters of linear codes as well as the cardinality of cap sets in certain projective spaces, we obtain various explicit results on the values of these constants. 1...|$|R
