5000|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{system is in}} equilibrium when {{it is no longer}} changing in time. This may happen in a very short time, or it may happen with glacial slowness.

If we have a thermodynamic system in equilibrium in which <b>we</b> <b>relax</b> some of its constraints, it will move to a new equilibrium state. The thermodynamic parameters may now be thought of as variables and the state may be thought of as a particular point in a space of thermodynamic parameters. The change in the state of the system can be seen as a path in this state space. This change is called a thermodynamic process. Thermodynamic equations are now used to express the relationships between the state parameters at these different equilibrium state.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{equation}} given above, {{it is clear}} that if the income falls to zero the amount of consumption will be equal to aW. However, this is not a fixed value, as it depends on wealth. Moreover, according to the given consumption function, the average propensity to consume isSince wealth does not change proportionately with income from individual to individual or from year to year, we should get the result that high income leads to a low average propensity to consume while looking at the data across persons or over short periods of time. However, generally {{over a long period of}} time, wealth and income increase together, which leads to a constant ratio [...] and thus a constant average propensity to consume. To further analyse the implications of the life-cycle model, we start by considering the case of a stationary economy in which population and productivity are constant through time. Then, <b>we</b> <b>relax</b> these assumptions one by one.|$|E
