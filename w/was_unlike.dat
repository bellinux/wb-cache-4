5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} {{fortunate}} position that on his accession to the earldom there {{seem to have been}} no other serious contenders. In this respect his rule <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> that of the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and of the next generation in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods.|$|E
60|$|What is wrong, then? Whatever <b>is</b> <b>unlike</b> right; {{whatever}} <b>is</b> <b>unlike</b> goodness; whatever <b>is</b> <b>unlike</b> God; that <b>is</b> wrong. And {{why does}} God forbid {{us to do}} wrong? Simply because wrong <b>is</b> <b>unlike</b> himself. He <b>is</b> perfectly beautiful, perfectly blest and happy, because he is perfectly good; and he wishes to see all his creatures beautiful, blest, and happy: but they can only be so by being perfectly good; and they can only be perfectly good by being perfectly like God their Father; and they can only be perfectly like God the Father by being full of love, loving their neighbour as themselves.|$|R
50|$|Recovery {{coaching}} <b>is</b> <b>unlike</b> most therapy because coaches do {{not address}} the past, do not work to heal trauma, {{and there is little}} emphasis on feelings. Recovery coaches <b>are</b> <b>unlike</b> licensed addiction counselors in that coaches are non-clinical and do not diagnose or treat addiction or any mental health issues.|$|R

5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} at Great Falls of the Passaic River in New Jersey was selected due to access to raw materials, it being densely inhabited, and {{having access to}} water power from the falls of the Passaic. The factory town was named Paterson after New Jersey's Governor William Paterson, who signed the charter. The profits were to derive from specific corporates rather than the benefits to be conferred to {{the nation and the}} citizens, which <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> the report. Hamilton also suggested the first stock to be offered at $500,000 and to eventually increase to $1million, and welcomed state and national government subscriptions alike. The company was never successful: numerous shareholders reneged on stock payments, some members soon went bankrupt, and William Duer, the governor of the program, was sent to debtors' prison. In spite of Hamilton's efforts to mend the disaster, the company would expire by 1796.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Christine {{originated}} from a tropical wave over Africa in late-August. As it neared the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned a tropical depression at 14.0°W, {{over the country}} of Guinea, on August25. The formation of this depression was farther east than any other tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic hurricane basin, although storms may have gone undetected {{prior to the start}} of satellite imagery in the 1960s. This record would not be approached by any other storm until Hurricane Jeanne in 1998, which formed at 17.4°W. This <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> most cyclone producing waves which travel several hundred miles over water before spawning a depression. Tracking nearly due west, the depression moved over water several hours later and bypassed the Cape Verde Islands on August 27.|$|E
5|$|Until about 1571/1572 Dudley {{supported}} Mary Stuart's succession {{rights to}} the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester <b>was,</b> <b>unlike</b> Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E

5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner was {{the first}} Megami Tensei title to be {{released}} on a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console, and the first Megami Tensei game to feature 3D graphics. The latter presented a new challenge for the development team: while they found adjusting to the new specifications a challenge, they also greatly enjoyed working with the Sega Saturn, the which <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> anything previously experienced by the team. Among the design staff were Katsura Hashino, who focused on combat, and Shogo Isogai, who focused on coordination between gameplay events. The demon conversation system was conceived by Okada based on experiences with the multiple accents encountered in the Kansai region of Japan. Using this as a base, he created the response system to give demon negotiation a more realistic feeling than previous Megami Tensei games. It was also a means of equalizing the relationship between demons and the player party, which had previously been more akin to master and servant than equal partners. The Zoma demons, which could be freely tailored into different demon types, was created while the team was balancing out the game's difficulty. The gameplay difficulty, which by later standards would be considered quite high, was toned down from the difficulty of earlier Megami Tensei titles {{to appeal to a}} wider audience. This necessitated balancing a more forgiving difficulty with keeping traditional Megami Tensei gameplay elements.|$|E

25|$|In fact, as guessed in 1995, {{the reasons}} for the poor {{performance}} of microkernels might as well have been: (1) an actual inefficiency of the whole microkernel approach, (2) the particular concepts implemented in those microkernels, and (3) the particular implementation of those concepts. Therefore it remained to be studied if the solution to build an efficient microkernel <b>was,</b> <b>unlike</b> previous attempts, to apply the correct construction techniques.|$|E

At the time, Hoppe-Seyler was intensely interested in research concerning an acidic substance that had first been chemically isolated from pus cells {{by one of his}} former students, Friedrich Miescher, in 1869. Unlike protein, the substance contained considerable amounts of phosphorus, but with its high acidity, it <b>was</b> <b>unlike</b> any cellular substance that had yet been observed.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, the gas industry's by-products, phenol, toluene and ammonia and {{sulphurous}} compounds were valuable {{ingredients for}} explosives.
