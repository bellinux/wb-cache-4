40|$|Ovine {{mastitis}} is {{an infectious}} disease associated to economic losses in dairy and meat sheep. The present study aims {{to determine the}} antimicrobial drug patterns of the most frequent etiologic agents of ovine mastitis. We analyzed 163 milk samples using <b>Whiteside</b> <b>test,</b> besides the bacteriological culture in ovine blood agar 5 % (AS). From 163 analyzed samples 23. 31 % and 14. 72 % were positive and strongly positive, according to the  <b>Whiteside</b> <b>test.</b> The most frequent etiologic agents of ovine mastitis isolated {{in the present study}} were: Staphylococcus spp. (31. 39 %), Acinetobacter spp. (10. 50 %), Enterobacter aerogenes (10. 50 %), Escherichia coli (8. 20 %) and Aeromonas spp. (6. 70 %). The sensitivity patterns to antimicrobial drugs showed high variation. The small sensitivity was observed to novobiocin (10. 46 %).   The higher sensitivity was detected to lyncomicin + streptomicin association (86. 02 %). In our study we conclude that Staphylococcus spp. are the most frequent bacterial agents envolved in subclinical mastitis in sheep. The association of lyncomicin + streptomicin and josamicin + thrimetoprin were more efficient in vitro sensitivity tests. KEY WORDS: Mastitis, microrganisms, antimicrobial resistance, <b>Whiteside</b> <b>test.</b> A mastite é uma enfermidade que acomete principalmente animais com aptidão leiteira, ocasionando uma série de prejuízos aos produtores de ovinos de leite e corte. Objetivou-se avaliar o perfil de sensibilidade aos antimicrobianos dos principais agentes causadores de mastite em ovelhas. Foram analisadas 163 amostras de leite, sendo utilizado o teste Whiteside Modificado (WSM), além do cultivo das amostras em ágar sangue ovino 5 % (AS). Das 163 amostras analisadas, observou-se que 23, 31 % e 14, 72 % foram positivas e fortemente positivas, respectivamente, no teste WSM. Os principais agentes isolados foram Staphylococcus spp. (31, 39 %), Acinetobacter spp. (10, 50 %), Enterobacter aerogenes (10, 50 %), Escherichia coli (8, 20 %) e Aeromonas spp. (6, 70 %). O perfil de sensibilidade aos antimicrobianos apresentou grande variação, com a novobiocina demonstrando o menor percentual de sensibilidade (10, 46 %). A maior taxa de susceptibilidade foi observada para a associação de lincomicina com estreptomicina (86, 02 %). Neste estudo, observou-se que os Staphylococcus spp. são os agentes comumente envolvidos nos casos de mastite subclínica em ovelhas. A associação entre lincomicina e estreptomicina e josamicina e trimetoprim constituiu as drogas mais eficientes nos testes de sensibilidade in vitro contra os agentes da mastite ovina.

40|$|Sixteen cows {{were used}} {{in a series of}} {{experiments}} to test dose, route and frequency responses in the production of milk and serum agglutinins to a spectrum of 9 proven bovine pathogens. The bacterial species were: Pasteurella multocida (2 isolates), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus sp., Corynebacterium sp., Salmonella enteriditis, and Aerobacter aerogenes. Primary immunizations were made either through the teat canal or intramuscularly. “Booster” injections were made through the teat canal. Agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. In the milk, titers were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. Variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. In all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. Udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15 -day interval separated immunizations. Inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7 -day interval of immunization. A positive <b>Whiteside</b> <b>test</b> was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. The findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work were to study the features of experimentally induced canine mastitis and to present hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of the disease. The tight caudal abdominal mammary gland of six bitches was inoculated on day 8 after whelping with Staphylococcus intermedius to induce mastitis; adjacent mammary glands were used as controls. Clinical examination, bacteriological and cytological (<b>whiteside</b> <b>test,</b> Giemsa) examination of mammary secretion, as well as haematological tests were performed from 5 days before until 34 days after challenge. Mastectomy was sequentially performed 1, 2, 4, 18, 26 and 34 days after challenge {{in each of the}} bitches, in order to carry out a pathological examination of mammary glands. All animals developed clinical mastitis: challenged glands became painful, hot, enlarged and oedematous; secretion was brownish, purulent, with flakes or clots, subsequently becoming yellowish and thick. Staphylococci were isolated from all inoculated glands (up to 22 days). WST was positive in 41 / 46 samples from inoculated glands and 66 / 138 samples from control glands; neutrophils predominated during the acute stage. Blood leukocyte counts increased, whilst platelet counts decreased. Gross pathological findings initially included congestion, purulent discharge and subcutaneous oedema; then abscesses, brownish areas and size decrease were seen. Salient histopathological features were initially neutrophilic infiltration, haemorrhages, destruction of mammary epithelial cells and alveoli, and then infiltration by lymphocytes, shrunken alveoli, loss of glandular architecture and fibrous tissue proliferation. We conclude that in bitches, intrammamary inoculation of Staphylococcus intermedius can induce clinical mastitis, followed by subclinical disease. The disorder is characterized by bacteria isolation and leukocyte influx in challenged glands, by leukocyte presence in adjacent mammary glands, by increased blood leukocyte counts and by destruction of mammary parenchyma.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} still plague much of {{the developing}} world. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV is critical for improved control and management allowing for targeted and effective treatment. The Whitesides Research Group led by George Whitesides, the Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers University Professor at Harvard, has developed a low-cost paper based diagnostic test that follows the principles of microfludics using paper’s inherent channels and natural capillary action. The first application that the <b>Whitesides</b> paper diagnostic <b>test</b> will perform is liver toxicity screening. The printing method for these diagnostic tests will model the newspaper press print format for efficient and speedy production. The Whitesides Group intends the test results to be analyzed using telemedicine. Camera phones will transmit images of the test to a lab where a doctor or a computer can make a diagnosis. The key area {{that has not yet}} been explicitly defined is the method of packaging, distribution, and portability of the paper diagnostic test squares. The proposed paper diagnostic dispenser will make the tests portable which will increase access to diagnostic tools in the developing world. Heath care volunteers will be able to carry the tests in a simple container and dispense test squares as needed. This device increases the mobility of health care workers, requires little to no training to use, and facilitates the decentralization of health care services in developing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} costly {{diseases}} in the dairy industry is mastitis, which is an inflammation of the mammary gland. Mastitis influences the quality of milk and therefore reduces financial returns to both the farmer and the processor. Early detection of mastitis typically reduces treatment cost and {{a significant amount of}} research has been done in this field. Currently, the three major methods for mastitis detection are: •The Foss Analysis, which physically counts each cell and is performed off-site. •The <b>Whiteside</b> <b>Test,</b> which is based on a direct relationship between the number of the blood cells and the intensity of a gel formed between NaOH and cells. It was developed for on-site mastitis detection, but is no longer used routinely. •The California Mastitis Test (CMT), which can be done on-site, but is only a quantitative indication of the severity of the infection. The California Mastitis Test has previously been adapted to determine the somatic cell count (SCC) in infected milk by correlating viscosity to cell count. Although highly successful, some uncertainty exists regarding the rheology of the gel formed during the test as well as factors that may influence the accuracy of the test. In this thesis, studies were undertaken on the rheology of the gel formed during the California Mastitis Test in order to develop an understanding of the mechanism of gel formation and how various factors influence the rheology of the gel. Basic biochemistry and physico-chemistry of the gel has been reviewed and {{it was found that the}} CMT gel is a DNA/histone/surfactant complex, which forms when SDS is introduced into infected milk with elevated somatic cell counts. Based on literature and some initial experimentation it was found that the gel is a time- and shear- dependent, non-Newtonian fluid. Since the reliability of the CMT hinges on the correlation between viscosity and SCC, this study investigated specific factors that may influence gelation, these were: •rheology •testing conditions, such as time delay prior to viscosity testing, shear rate and temperature •surfactant type and concentration •milk composition, including fat content, somatic cell count and protein content. It was found that when using capillary viscometry a linear relationship exists between the relative viscosity of the gel and the SCC. The surfactant concentration determines the slope of this linear relationship and it was found that at least 3 % SDS is necessary for accurate results. Using more than 3 % SDS resulted in more scatter in the data. It was also found that a linear relationship exists between the maximum apparent viscosity and SCC. Either capillary or Brookfield viscometry can be used, however, Brookfield viscometry was found to be more sensitive at the lower SCC range. It was found that the combination of surfactant concentration and SCC influenced the rheology of the gel. The lower the SCC the more SDS was required for gel formation. It was found that when using 1 % SDS the critical SCC was 79 k cell/ml, while using 3 % SDS this was lowered to 59 k cell/ml. It was found that above the critical SCC the gel is a non-Newtonian rheopectic fluid. Dependent on shear rate, the gel shows rheodestructive behaviour. With a delay time, the peak viscosity of the gel formed faster with longer delay times. However, more than 30 seconds delay had no additional influence on gel formation. It was found that the shear rate or spindle speed influences both the time to reach the peak viscosity as well as the magnitude of this maximum. Higher shear rates shortened the time to reach the maximum apparent viscosity as well as the maximum viscosity. This is likely due to physical breakdown of the gel which is accelerated due to increased shear. Different surfactants have different effects on raw milk. Both acetic acid and Triton- 114 were found to be ineffective as CMT reagents. Acetic acid only denatures proteins and the increased viscosity is due to the precipitation of casein. Triton- 114 cannot lyse nuclei walls and therefore gel formation was prohibited due to no DNA/histone complexes being released. Mixing SDS with Triton- 114 was found to be less effective than SDS alone either due to the nucleus not being lysed, or because of interaction effects between SDS and Triton- 114, reducing the available SDS for gelation. Lastly it was concluded that protein and fat content only contributes to the viscosity of milk by changing the solids content of milk and neither of these affects gelation during the CMT. Also, temperature only has a small influence on the relative viscosity and this influence could be neglected if the CMT is done around room temperature...|$|E
