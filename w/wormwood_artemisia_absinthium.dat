2500|$|A {{number of}} Bible {{scholars}} consider the term Wormwood to be a purely symbolic {{representation of the}} bitterness that will fill the earth during troubled times, noting that the plant for which <b>Wormwood</b> is named, <b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium,</b> or Mugwort, <b>Artemisia</b> vulgaris, is a known Biblical metaphor for things that are unpalatably bitter. The Ukrainian language word for [...] "wormwood" [...] is чорнобиль or [...] "chornobyl", the Ukrainian name {{of the town of}} Chernobyl.|$|R
30|$|To {{discourage}} the flies that {{were attracted to}} the smell of urine, smoke sticks were made from locally sourced materials from the author’s workshop garden. They were constructed using rosemary sprigs (Rosmarinus officinalis), sage (Salvia officinalis) and the pungent leaves of the <b>wormwood</b> plant (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium)</b> and when burnt, had similar repellent properties as smouldering myrrh from the genus Commiphora tree that’s native to Africa and Southwest Asia [24]. As described in the LDA, adding myrrh as an additive ingredient to repel flies when preparing recipes using egg glair, was indeed a common practice in certain paint preparations [14]. However, using smokes sticks for this particular purpose, rather than burning or even adding myrrh to the recipe—which could alter the colour characteristics of the recipe if applied directly—presents the author’s thinking for locally sourcing alternative materials {{which could be used}} as sufficient workable substitutes—if at all possible—with neither more, nor less practically effectiveness, than materials which may be expensive or indeed scarce to acquire. Whereas fencing oneself inside a net screen-house to form a barrier against flies could be implemented, it negates the physical motion and the all-inclusive perception when working in an exterior art workshop. Therefore, using and making smoke sticks are a personal preference which has practical functions.|$|R
50|$|La Fée Absinthe Blanche Parisienne {{was first}} {{distilled}} in 2011 {{in association with}} the Musée de l’Absinthe, Auvers-sur-Oise, France, and its founder and curator, Marie-Claude Delahaye.

5000|$|The Greeks used kásia (cassia) or malabathron to flavour wine, {{together}} with absinth <b>wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium).</b> Malabathrum leaves (folia) {{were used in}} cooking and for distilling an oil used in a caraway-sauce for oysters by the Roman gourmet Gaius Gavius Apicius. [...] Malabathrum is among the spices that, according to Apicius, any good kitchen should contain. Malobathrum from Egypt (Dioscorides I, 63) was based on beef fat and contained cinnamon, as well; one pound cost 300 denarii.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to 2009, Absente {{sold in the}} U.S. {{contained}} no grande <b>wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium),</b> the essential herb from which absinthe derives its name. The maker substituted southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) and the product was bottled with sugar, two critical aspects that differentiated Absente as an anise liqueur and not an absinthe by any traditional reference. The ingredients of Absente are listed in order as alcohol, sugar, a combination of [...] "essences", infusions and distillates, and two artificial dyes, FD&C Yellow #5 and Blue #1.|$|E
50|$|Lucid is {{distilled}} {{entirely from}} all natural ingredients {{and is the}} first genuine absinthe distilled with real Grande <b>Wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium)</b> available in the United States in more than 95 years. Lucid is made with historically accurate volumes of Grande Wormwood, {{as well as other}} botanicals, such as green anise and sweet fennel that are traditional to the spirit. The recipe was developed by T.A. Breaux, an absinthe expert and historian. Lucid’s green color is derived directly from the botanicals, without any artificial coloring added - a key feature of genuine absinthe. Lucid’s natural color requires a dark bottle because exposure to light will cause the natural color to fade, which explains why so many traditional absinthes were bottled in dark glass.|$|E
5000|$|Hapsburg is a {{brand of}} absinthe;containing the herb <b>wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium).</b> Hapsburg Absinthe {{manufactures}} five different types of Absinthe: Hapsburg Classic which is a 72.5%, X.C. has an alcohol content of 89.9%, Flavoured Absinthe ideally made for [...] shooters at 33%, A Rich Irish Cream Absinthe, and La Magnifique, a hand made Verte Absinthe.Hapsburg Absinthe was established in 1999. The popularity of Absinthe really began to take off in the 1990s when the Czech Republic was opened to tourism. The Green Fairy was still a popular drink in the Czech Republic and many tourists would have their first experience with the drink on their visits to this country. By the mid-1990s, absinthe had become a regular fixture in many bars in the UK.|$|E

5000|$|Pastis {{is often}} {{associated}} with its historical predecessor, absinthe, yet the two are in fact very different. Pastis does not contain grand <b>wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium),</b> the herb from which absinthe derives its name. Also, pastis obtains its anise flavor from a distillation (or industrially prepared distillates) of star anise, a herb of Asian origin, whereas absinthe traditionally obtains its base flavor from green anise, a European herb. Furthermore, pastis traditionally exhibits the distinct flavor of licorice root (another herb of Asian origin), which is not a part of a traditional absinthe. Where bottled strength is concerned, traditional absinthes were bottled at 45-74% ABV, while pastis is typically bottled at 40-50% ABV. Finally, unlike a traditional absinthe, pastis is a [...] "liqueur", which means it is always bottled with sugar.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} Fish indeed used very little {{gardening}} help. She squeezed her writing around working 18-hour days on developing {{and maintaining the}} garden, even doing dry stone walling and path-laying herself. Her silver garden caught {{the heat of the}} day, and her damp, shady garden used a stream that ran behind an old malthouse. The silver-leafed <b>wormwood</b> <b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium</b> 'Lambrook Silver' is still a popular variety. Other varieties named after her garden include the spurge Euphorbia characias ssp. wulfenii 'Lambrook Gold', the cotton lavender Santolina chamaecyparissus 'Lambrook Silver', and the primrose Primula 'Lambrook Mauve'. She hunted out several rare old double forms and single and named coloured forms of primrose. There are varieties of Pulmonaria, Penstemon, Bergenia, Dicentra, Hebe, Euphorbia characias and Hemerocallis named after her. She is credited with aptly naming the variety Astrantia major subsp involucrata 'Shaggy' on discovering it in her garden.|$|E
5000|$|The name Panagia Apsinthiotissa {{refers to}} Panagia, the Orthodox {{name for the}} Virgin Mary, and Absinthe, a toponym derived from the {{cultivation}} of <b>wormwood</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>absinthium)</b> shrubs in the area. According to a local legend, the monastery was named after a wormwood bush that covered {{the mouth of the}} cave in which a monk had hidden an icon of the Virgin Mary in order to save it during the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. Many years later, after the restoration of images, the inhabitants of the area saw a strange light shining from this point on the mountain. They found the icon and built a monastery immediately below {{in the name of the}} Virgin and the wormwood bush. The monastery was known in western medieval sources as the Abbey of Abscithi or Apinthi. Sometimes it was simply called Psithia, as in the Chronicle of George Boustronios.|$|E
