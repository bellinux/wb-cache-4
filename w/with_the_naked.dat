5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest.

Later, Tondemon tells the club about secret scrolls guarded by four guardians that reveal secret martial arts training. Tamako and Mokichi set off to get the scrolls.|$|R

25|$|The World Naked Bike Ride {{was born}} in 2001 in Spain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>naked</b> bike rides, which then emerged as the WNBR in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many {{different}} activist groups and individuals {{around the world to}} promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, walkable communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions to living in the twenty-first century.|$|R
50|$|Before each bout, the wrestlers pour {{olive oil}} over their entire bodies, and the matches take place in an open, grassy field, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> contestants <b>naked</b> except for {{trousers}} made of leather, which extend to just below the knee.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>naked</b> mole-rat is a {{long-lived}} (32 years) rodent. As {{reviewed by}} Lewis et al., (2013), levels of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) production in <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> mole rat are {{similar to that of}} another rodent, the relatively short-lived mouse (4 years). They concluded that it is not oxidative stress that modulates health-span and longevity in these rodents, but rather other cytoprotective mechanisms that allow animals to deal with high levels of oxidative damage and stress. [...] In <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> mole-rat, a likely important cytoprotective mechanism that could provide longevity assurance is elevated expression of DNA repair genes involved in several key DNA repair pathways. (See DNA damage theory of aging.) Compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mouse, <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> mole rat had significantly higher expression levels of genes essential for the DNA repair pathways of DNA mismatch repair, non-homologous end joining and base excision repair.|$|R
25|$|The Gymnopaedia, {{in ancient}} Sparta, was a yearly celebration during which naked youths {{displayed}} their athletic and martial skills {{through the medium}} of war dancing. The custom was introduced in 668 BC, concurrently <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduction of <b>naked</b> athletics.|$|R

40|$|Naked sunspots are spots seen in H-alpha to be {{devoid of}} {{associated}} plage. In magnetograms and K-line {{little if any}} opposite polarity field is found, and in soft X ray images a blank appears {{in the region of}} the spot. In almost all cases studied in which <b>naked</b> spots resulted <b>the</b> spot groups had emerged in unipolar regions of the same polarity as <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> spot. At least half of <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> spots are associated <b>with</b> coronal holes. <b>The</b> <b>naked</b> spots are long-lived and show rotation rates close to the Newton-Nunn curve. Most of <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> spots had bright rims in H-alpha, and the one spot observed to disappear left no trace in the background magnetic field. These spots may be a means by which separation of p from f magnetic polarity occurs...|$|R

5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, though {{it can be seen}} using binoculars.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E
5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim to be seen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye.
