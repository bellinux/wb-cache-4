It increased from 2519. 80 kg/ha in 1980 to 4216. 11 kg/ha in 2003, with an increasing rate of 67. 32 %; 2) the variation of grain yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> is considerably prominent and its range is also very great, with the maximal increase rate of 42. 59 % and maximal decrease rate of 21. 13 %, respectively, which are far above the whole Chinese average level; 3) the variation of main crops' yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> is remarkable, which takes on the character that the yield of corn {{is much higher than}} that of soybean and rice; and 4) the grey correlation analysis shows that the most important factors impacting the variation of grain yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> are the total power of agricultural machinery, the consumption of chemical fertilizer and effective irrigated area.

In this paper the effect of Fe stress on photosynthetic unit number, size, and composition was investigated by measuring P 700, cytochrome (Cyt) f, chlorophyll (Chl) a, and Chl b in sugar beet leaves. The results show that when Fe stress reduced Chl per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> by 80 % (from 60 to 12 micrograms per square centimeter), it decreased the number of P 700 molecules per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> by 88 % and Cyt f per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> by 86 %; over the same range the Chl to P 700 ratio increased by 37 % but there was no significant change in the Chl to Cyt f ratio.

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the impacts of climate change and technical progress on the wheat yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> from 1970 to 2014 in Henan, the largest agricultural province in China, using an autoregressive distributed lag approach. The bounded F-test for cointegration among the model variables yielded evidence of a long-run relationship among climate change, technical progress, and the wheat yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> In the long run, agricultural machinery and fertilizer use both had significantly positive impacts on the per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> wheat yield. A 1 % increase in the aggregate quantity of fertilizer use increased the wheat yield by 0. 19 %. Additionally, a 1 % increase in machine use increased the wheat yield by 0. 21 %. In contrast, precipitation during the wheat growth period (from emergence to maturity, consisting of the period from last October to June) led to {{a decrease in the}} wheat yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> In the short run, the coefficient of the aggregate quantity of fertilizer used was negative. Land size had a significantly positive impact on the per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> wheat yield in the short run. There was no significant short-run or long-run impact of temperature on the wheat yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> in Henan Province. The results of our analysis suggest that climate change had a weak impact on the wheat yield, while technical progress {{played an important role in}} increasing the wheat yield per <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> The results of this study have implications for national and local agriculture policies under climate change. To design well-targeted agriculture adaptation policies for the future and to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on the wheat yield, climate change and technical progress factors should be considered simultaneously. In addition, adaptive measures associated with technical progress should be given more attention...|$|R
