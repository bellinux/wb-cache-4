500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can? I do not. The question is, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> squeeze too much?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is like a brother to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he will leave?" [...] Zhang Liao replied, [...] "Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He'll most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{writing as}} a whole {{demonstrates}} a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera. Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of sacrificium. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: [...] "Even when [...] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has {{been brought to the}} ground, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" [...] His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a bustuarius– literally, a [...] "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, [...] "gladiator" [...] could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and [...] "Samnite" [...] doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type. Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: [...] "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [...] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua." [...] Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.|$|E
