40|$|Nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{leaching}} from agriculture {{has become}} an increasigly important issue in New Zealand. There {{has been an increase}} in NO₃⁻ leaching in recent years, with the cause of this mainly due to increases in cattle numbers and the application of N fertilisers. NO₃⁻ leaching is of importance due to its economic cost to farmers, environmental impact and potential health risk. Economic cost to the farmers occurs when leached nitrogen (N) has to be replaced with fertiliser N. There is also a major environmental concern about eutrophication. Eutrophication causes an increase in algae and aquatic life and reduces the recreational value of waterways. <b>Winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> systems leach disproportitally high amounts of N, compared {{with the rest of the}} farming system. There are very few measurements of nitrate leaching losses from below <b>winter</b> <b>grazed</b> fodder beet (FB) in New Zealand. Measurements are needed urgently to quantify and ultimately minimise NO₃⁻ losses from these systems. The current systems of measuring NO₃⁻ leaching suffer from limitations such as being labour intensive, the inability to measure nitrate leaching under cultivation and the need to scale up results from small plots or lysimeters. The objective of this research project was to develop a new system of measuring N leaching that could accurately quantify N leaching under a <b>winter</b> <b>grazed</b> FB crop without the limitations of current systems. The suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system was developed to overcome these limitations. This was done through having a single collection/retrieval site, changing the depth of the top of the suction cup shaft to below the level of cultivation in soil, increasing the number of suction cups per unit area and having a large measurement area (0. 16 ha). The SCALAR system was developed and tested in this research project. The results showed that the SCALAR system successfully overcome the limitations of previous measurement systems. The results of this study showed the total N leaching under the <b>winter</b> <b>grazed</b> FB crop was 106. 9 kg N/ha. Of this, 101. 5 kg N/ha was leached in the form of NO₃⁻ and 5. 4 kg N/ha was leached in the form of ammonium (NH₄⁺). However, these values are likely to have been affected by the development and testing of the SCALAR system and are therefore not considered to be representative of a typical <b>winter</b> <b>grazed</b> FB crop. Future research is still needed to quantify N leaching losses under a <b>winter</b> <b>grazed</b> FB crop using the SCALAR system that has been developed in this project. The SCALAR system will potentially remain in the ground for 20 - 30 years, allowing it to be used in future research to quantify N leaching under a variety of farming systems...|$|R

In the past we have not been in a position here at the college to work out details of the various systems of beef production since experiment grazing land was not available.

40|$|Dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> is {{a common}} {{practice}} within the Canterbury region of New Zealand. However, until recently {{there was a lack}} of knowledge about the concentration and amount of nitrate-N (NO₃⁻-N) leached from dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> systems. In addition, {{there was a lack of}} knowledge around what ammonia oxidising microbes mediated the nitrification process in intensively <b>grazed</b> <b>winter</b> forage systems where the soils are usually wet, cold, and anaerobic. Furthermore, it was not known whether the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) or biochar could be successful mitigation tools in reducing nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) leaching from these systems. Thus the objectives of this research were to: 1) quantify the concentration and the amount of NO₃⁻-N leached from cow urine patches deposited during dairy winter forage grazing; 2) quantify the effects of trampling on NO 3 - leaching losses under dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> conditions; 3) improve knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of the mitigation tools DCD and biochar, to reduce NO₃⁻-N leaching losses under dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> conditions; and 4) improve knowledge and understanding on the effect of cow urine, animal trampling, DCD, and biochar, on the abundance and activity of AOB and AOA under dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> conditions. Two lysimeter trials were carried out using a Balmoral stony silt loam under a kale forage crop to cover these objectives by measuring the NO₃⁻-N leaching losses, the effect of soil trampling, and the use of DCD and biochar as mitigation tools. Companion plots were used to measure the soil nitrification rates and ammonia oxidising community abundance and activity under dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> conditions. The first trial had a urine application rate of 700 kg N ha- 1. However, the second trial had a lower urine application rate of 400 kg N ha- 1 due to recent research identifying a lower urine-N concentration from kale-fed dairy cows. Both lysimeter trials identified that the dominant source of NO₃⁻ leaching loss was from the cow urine. The lower application rate of urine (400 kg N ha- 1) had significantly lower NO₃⁻-N leaching losses compared to urine applied at 700 kg N ha- 1. In addition, the first lysimeter trial identified that DCD reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 38 % and DCD combined with biochar resulted in a reduction of 46 %. However, biochar alone did not significantly reduce NO₃⁻-N leaching losses. The second lysimeter trial found that trampling the soil reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 34 % (urine only). DCD reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 61 % when soil was trampled and by 40 % when un-trampled. Both companion soil plots showed that ammonia oxidiser communities were affected by the application of urine: the AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB amoA transcript abundance significantly increased, whereas AOA growth was inhibited. A companion incubation study was carried out to determine the effect of urine application rates, DCD application rates, and biochar presence on nitrification, ammonia oxidising community abundance and activity under simulated dairy <b>winter</b> forage <b>grazing</b> conditions. The application of urine increased soil nitrification rates. However, there was no difference between the two urine application rates. DCD reduced the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration by 86 - 91 %. The application rate of 20 kg DCD ha- 1 had a significantly lower soil NO₃⁻-N concentration compared to the application rate of 10 kg DCD ha- 1. DCD combined with biochar reduced the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration by 86 %. However, biochar alone did not affect the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration. The AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB amoA transcript abundance significantly increased with the application of urine, whereas the AOA growth was suppressed...|$|R

They can usually be purchased {{at a lower price}} per hundredweight than steer calves and may be finished with a relatively shorter feeding period in the late summer or fall.

This study is concerned with lowering the cost of wintering and its effect on future performance, especially with respect to the effect on the carcass produced.
