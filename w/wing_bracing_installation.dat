50|$|The {{design was}} aerodynamically advanced, {{featuring}} a continuous aerofoil section over {{all parts of}} the aircraft, including the fuselage and, unusually for British aircraft at that time, had no form of <b>wing</b> <b>bracing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The AGO C.VII was a German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft of World War I. In C.VII, AGO attempted to improve upon its C.IV design by revising the <b>wing</b> <b>bracing.</b> Only a single prototype was built.|$|R
50|$|Trainer {{variant of}} the Metal-Gipsy Moth. Rearranging of the inner <b>wing</b> <b>bracing</b> wires allowed for easier access to the front cockpit, a {{necessity}} for military pilots wearing parachutes. Two prototypes and 47 production aircraft were built.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 a glider version {{called the}} Aviette had flown. This had an {{extended}} span of 10.50 m and an unladen weight of only 43 kg. It {{also had a}} deeper fuselage, allowing the pilot to sit with his head just clear of the upper surface, and a new upper <b>wing</b> <b>bracing</b> system with the bracing wires attached {{to the top of}} a tall, three post pylon, just in front of the pilot. It also had a reshaped rudder with a linear, rising top. It was the only Moustique type glider, but the fuselage, <b>wing</b> <b>bracing</b> and rudder modifications were carried forward into all later variants.|$|R
2500|$|... 7D7 - {{similar to}} 7D4 but with <b>wing</b> <b>bracing</b> again using I-struts (this time of narrow chord) and the bracing wires simplified. The {{flush-mounted}} radiator in the wing {{was replaced by}} ear-style frontal radiators on the forward fuselage ...|$|R
50|$|The Avenger {{structure}} is entirely constructed from wood, {{with a low}} <b>wing</b> <b>braced</b> to the landing gear. The wooden-framed wing is covered with aircraft fabric.

50|$|Built in {{collaboration}} with du Rivau, the Botali P.A.M.A was a high <b>wing,</b> <b>braced</b> monoplane. In plan its two-piece wing was rectangular apart from rounded tips. It was built around two spruce and plywood box spars 800 mm apart and ply covered. The <b>wings</b> were wire <b>braced</b> on each side, {{with a pair of}} stout flying wires from the lower fuselage to the spars and thinner landing wires from a triangular steel tube cabane on the upper fuselage. Long ailerons, with a chord of only 300 mm occupied the entire trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|Barksdale died August 11, 1926 over McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio while {{testing a}} Douglas O-2 {{observation}} airplane for spin characteristics. He did not {{recover from a}} flat spin while parachuting out of the plane, and his parachute {{was caught in the}} <b>wing's</b> <b>brace</b> wires, causing Barksdale to fall to his death. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The Chengdu X-7 is a two-seat basic {{training}} glider of glass-fibre construction, which first flew in October 1966. It is a high-winged monoplane with the <b>wing</b> <b>braced</b> to the pod-and-boom fuselage by single struts. The crew of two sit in tandem open cockpits, while the undercarriage is a non-retractable monowheel, with nose- and tailskids. 130 {{had been built}} by 1980.|$|R
50|$|The F.K.32 was an unequal span, single bay biplane, its <b>wings</b> <b>braced</b> with {{strongly}} outward-leaning V-form interplane struts on {{each side}} and a noticeable absence of flying wire. The wings were slightly tapered in plan and had rounded tips. The horizontal tail, placed {{on top of the}} fuselage was straight edged and double tapered; the vertical tail was almost rectangular.|$|R
50|$|The BS.8 Biancone was {{a higher}} {{performance}} {{version of the}} BS.7 primary trainer. The two designs, both high-wing monoplanes, shared a fuselage boom, empennage and <b>wing</b> <b>bracing</b> struts, but the later type had a nacelle with a conventional open cockpit and a pedestal {{in place of the}} B.7's simple boom and open girder, together with a new wing of much higher aspect ratio.|$|R
50|$|The Carmier was a parasol monoplane, with {{a two-part}} {{rectangular}} plan <b>wing</b> <b>braced</b> {{to the lower}} fuselage by pairs of parallel struts out to the spruce wing spars at about 40% span. They were thick in section, with a thickness/chord ratio of 18%, and strongly cambered. The wings were plywood covered and carried full span, narrow ailerons which could operate together as flaps or conventionally.|$|R
