25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general <b>world</b> <b>knowledge</b> that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{independent}} open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing. Most notably, the startup publisher Flat <b>World</b> <b>Knowledge</b> already has dozens of college-level open textbooks {{that are used}} by more than 900 institutions in 44 countries. [...] Their business model was to offer the open textbook free online, and then sell ancillary products that students are likely to buy if prices are reasonable - print copies, study guides, ePub, [...]Mobi (Kindle), PDF download, etc. Flat <b>World</b> <b>Knowledge</b> compensates its authors with royalties on these sales. With the generated revenue Flat <b>World</b> <b>Knowledge</b> funded high-quality publishing activities with a goal of making the Flat World financial model sustainable. However, in January, 2013 Flat <b>World</b> <b>Knowledge</b> announced their financial model could no longer sustain their free-to-read options for students.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{compiling}} the <b>world's</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{in a single}} location {{dates back to the}} ancient Libraries of Alexandria and Pergamum, but the modern concept of a general-purpose, widely distributed, printed encyclopedia originated with Denis Diderot and the 18th-century French encyclopedists. The idea of using automated machinery beyond the printing press to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to Paul Otlet's 1934 book Traité de documentation; Otlet also founded the Mundaneum, an institution dedicated to indexing the <b>world's</b> <b>knowledge,</b> in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in H. G. Wells' book of essays World Brain (1938) and Vannevar Bush's future vision of the microfilm-based Memex in his essay [...] "As We May Think" [...] (1945). Another milestone was Ted Nelson's hypertext design Project Xanadu, which was begun in 1960.|$|R
