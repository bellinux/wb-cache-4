40|$|Changes in {{cellular}} calcium (Ca 2 +) handling {{are thought}} to underlie the altered contraction that occurs during cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Recent work has highlighted the importance of t-tubules in the control of intracellular Ca 2 +. The present study was performed to investigate whether changes {{in the distribution of}} <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> between the surface and t-tubule membranes might contribute to the altered Ca 2 + handling observed during compensated hypertrophy in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Experiments were performed on ventricular myocytes isolated from 5 -month-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Osmotic shock using formamide was used to disrupt the t-tubular system and the whole-cell patch clamp technique used to monitor <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> in the presence and absence of t-tubules. Membrane capacitance and <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> were greater in control SHR than WKY myocytes; following detubulation, cell capacitance and <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> both decreased and were no longer significantly different in the two cell types. The density of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was not significantly different in control SHR and WKY cells or in detubulated myocytes from the two species. These data suggest that the distribution of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is unchanged in SHR myocytes compared to WKY controls; <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> density in the t-tubules was 1. 2 -fold greater than in the sarcolemma in both strains. These data also imply that the increase in surface area in SHR myocytes is due principally to an increase in t-tubular area, which is accompanied by an approximately equivalent increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca,</b> so that the density of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> at the cell surface and in the t-tubules remains the same. These changes would be expected to retain cell function and synchronicity of Ca 2 + release in the SHR at this stage of compensated hypertrophy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is {{a hormone}} predominately {{synthesized}} and secreted by intestinal L-cells. GLP- 1 modulates multiple cellular functions and its receptor agonists are now used clinically for diabetic treatment. Interestingly, preclinical and clinical {{evidence suggests that}} GLP- 1 agonists produce beneficial effects on dysfunctional hearts via acting on myocardial GLP- 1 receptors. As the effects of GLP- 1 on myocyte electrophysiology are largely unknown, {{this study was to}} assess if GLP- 1 could affect the cardiac voltage-gated L-type Ca 2 + current (<b>I</b> <b>Ca).</b> Methods The whole-cell patch clamp method was used to record <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> and action potentials in enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes from adult canine left ventricles. Results Extracellular perfusion of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) at 5 nM increased <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> by 23 ± 8 % (p Ca; however, the increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was abolished if Exendin (9 - 39) was pre-applied 5 min prior to GLP- 1 administration. Intracellular dialysis with a protein kinase A inhibitor also blocked the GLP- 1 -enhanced <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> In addition, GLP- 1 at 5 nM prolonged the durations of the action potentials by 128 ± 36 ms (p p Conclusions Our data demonstrate that GLP- 1 enhances <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> in canine cardiomyocytes. The enhancement of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is likely via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A mechanism and may contribute, at least partially, to the prolongation of the action potential duration. </p...|$|R

40|$|The hormone {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) regulates stress {{responses}} and developmental processes in plants. Calcium-permeable channels activated by {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) have been shown recently to function in the ABA signaling network in Arabidopsis guard cells. Here, we report that ABA activation of these <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> Ca 2 � channels requires the presence of NAD(P) H in the cytosol. The protein phosphatase 2 C (PP 2 C) mutant abi 1 - 1 disrupted ABA activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> channels. Moreover, in abi 1 - 1, ABA did not induce ROS production. Consistent with these findings, in abi 1 - 1, H 2 O 2 activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> channels and H 2 O 2 -induced stomatal closing were not disrupted, suggesting that abi 1 - 1 impairs ABA signaling between ABA reception and ROS production. The abi 2 - 1 mutation, which lies in a distinct PP 2 C gene, also disrupted ABA activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> However, in contrast to abi 1 - 1, abi 2 - 1 impaired both H 2 O 2 activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> and H 2 O 2 -induced stomatal closing. Furthermore, ABA elicited ROS production in abi 2 - 1. These data suggest a model with the following sequence of events in early ABA signal transduction: ABA, abi 1 - 1, NAD(P) H-dependent ROS production, abi 2 - 1, <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> Ca 2 � channel activatio...|$|R

40|$|The cardiac voltage gated Ca 2 + current (<b>I</b> <b>Ca)</b> is {{critical}} to the electrophysiological properties, excitation-contraction coupling, mitochondrial energetics, and transcriptional regulation in heart. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} cardiac <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is regulated by numerous pathways. This review will focus on changes in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> that occur during the cardiac action potential (AP), with particular attention to Ca 2 + -dependent inactivation (CDI), Ca 2 + -dependent facilitation (CDF) and how calmodulin (CaM) and Ca 2 + -CaM dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) participate in the regulation of Ca 2 + current during the cardiac AP. CDI depends on CaM pre-bound to the C-terminal of the L-type Ca 2 + channel, such that Ca 2 + influx and Ca 2 + released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bind to that CaM and cause CDI. In cardiac myocytes CDI normally pre-dominates over voltage-dependent inactivation. The decrease in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> via CDI provides direct negative feedback on the overall Ca 2 + influx during a single beat, when myocyte Ca 2 + loading is high. CDF builds up over several beats, depends on CaMKII-dependent Ca 2 + channel phosphorylation, and results in a staircase of increasing <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> peak, with progressively slower inactivation. CDF and CDI co-exist and in combination may fine-tune the <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> waveform during the cardiac AP. CDF may partially compensate for the tendency for Ca 2 + channel availability to decrease at higher heart rates because of accumulating inactivation. CDF may also allow some reactivation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> during long duration cardiac APs, and contribute to early afterdepolarizations, a form of triggered arrhythmias. © 2014 Bers and Morotti...|$|R
