40|$|Rock {{abrasiveness}} is {{ability of}} <b>rock</b> to <b>wear</b> down the working tool during the mutual {{interaction between the}} working indentor and the rock in the mechanical rock cutting process. The cutting indentor is worn down during the interaction, which changes its geometric dimensions causing the enlargement of a contact area between the tool and the rock surface. The changes in these dimensions consequently alter the rate of advance of the drilling machine and the specific cutting energy. We have determined the abrasiveness according to the norm ON 44 1121 (1982) on the testing device constructed at the Institute of Geotechnics SAS.

50|$|In Taoism, {{rocks and}} water were opposites, yin and yang, but they complemented and {{completed}} one another. Rocks were solid but water could <b>wear</b> away <b>rock.</b> The deeply eroded rocks from Lake Tai {{used in the}} classical garden illustrated this principle.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{drill bit}} buttons with cobalt, nickel and iron binders in {{different}} compositions {{have been tested}} against granite and sandstone and the wear and friction have been measured. Furthermore, the wear and degradation of the buttons have been categorized. Buttons with cobalt binder were tested against granite and sandstone and buttons with alternative binders (Ni, Fe, Co) were tested against granite. Cobalt buttons were used as a reference and the wear and friction of the alternative binders was compared to the reference. The amount of <b>worn</b> <b>rock</b> was also measured. Furthermore, post treated drill bit buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co were compared to buttons with the same composition {{that had not been}} post treated The results show that buttons with an alternative composition of Fe-Co-Ni and Fe- Ni wears less than the cobalt reference. The post treatment process does not decrease the wear of the drill bit but lowers the deviation from the mean wear. The amount of <b>worn</b> <b>rock</b> does not differ between the samples except for between the post treated and not post treated buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co. The post treated buttons produces more rock debris than the not post treated. No apparent difference could be seen {{on the surface of the}} tested buttons after the test. However, composition specific cracks could be found underneath the surface of the samples. EDS-analysis showed signals of oxygen inside of all of the investigated cracks. For some compositions at depths of 20 micrometers. The curves of friction shows similar appearance but the values of the coefficient of friction differs. No apparent correlation was found between the wear and friction of the samples. Furthermore, no apparent correlation was found between the hardness and the wear of the buttons. ...|$|R

The god informs Quetzalcóatl that he has to travel through his kingdom four times, while a shell sounds out like a trumpet. However, in place of giving Quetzalcóatl the shell from Mictlantecuhtl he gives him a normal shell, without holes in it. To not be mocked Quetzalcóatl beckons the worms to come perforate the shell, thus creating holes. He then calls the bees to enter the shell and to make it sound out like a trumpet. (As an emblem of his power over wind and life, Quetzalcóatl is commonly depicted wearing a cut shell over his chest, this shell represents the same shell that Ehécatl [...] (the god of the <b>wind)</b> <b>wears).</b>|$|R

60|$|The {{shade of}} the cottonwoods was pleasant. Slone found this valley oppressively hot. There was no wind and the sand {{blistered}} his feet through his boots.

Then {{they came to a}} box-like closing of the valley to canyon walls, and here the trail evidently followed the stream bed. There was no other way. Slone waded in, and stumbled, rolled, and floated ahead of the sturdy horse. Nagger was wet to his breast, but he did not fall. This gulch seemed full of a hollow rushing roar. It opened out into a wide valley. And Wildfire's tracks took to the left side and began to climb the slope.|$|R
