His video collaged deliberately expose the joins, in order to reveal the hidden scars within the landscape, often manifest within architecture. Jinjoon thought the multi-layering of images, wishes to explore the ambiguities of collective memory and experience through public and private perception, and the need to memorialise. The resulting ambiguity engenders a new type of deconstruction: of the notion of the sublime, which is questioned through a continuous journey between apparent proximity (transparency of the image) and effective distance (decoding its narrative connections).
