5|$|The mind–body problem {{concerns}} {{the explanation of}} the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. The main aim of philosophers <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area {{is to determine the}} nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E

5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and madder for red. Living and <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E

In 1954, the television company Desilu Productions produced a pilot of the show for a sitcom, also starring Byington. The pilot was successful, and the new hit sitcom aired in its first two seasons immediately following I Love Lucy. December Bride broadcast 111 episodes through 1959.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E

25|$|The Austrian School is {{a school}} of {{economic}} thought {{that is based on}} methodological individualism – the concept that social phenomena result from the motivations and actions of individuals. It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of Carl Menger, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others. It was methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School (in a dispute known as Methodenstreit). Current-day economists <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> tradition are located in many different countries, but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics.|$|E

Her younger brother Patrick appears in the film as her brother Samuel. During filming, Hurd-Wood studied for her GCSE A-levels at Godalming College in Surrey. Later in the year she acted in the film Dorian Gray based on the Oscar Wilde novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. She was in the small but key role of the young budding actress Sibyl Vane, with whom Gray falls in love. She was studying {{in the first year}} of the linguistics course at UCL while <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{brought new}} {{insights}} into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the artisans. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> play. Also in 1961, Frank Kermode wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of Macrobius, Apuleius, and Giordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.|$|E

25|$|Hemphill style pottery spans {{most of the}} 14th and {{the first}} half of the 15th century CE In this time period there were more than likely only a few potters <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> style at any one time and in some cases archaeologists have found {{signature}} features that suggest a specific potter made multiple known examples. Archaeologists have also dated the ceramics and found that the most expertly made pieces were done in the 14th century. These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden style shell engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was attached to this particular artform.|$|E
25|$|Neo-expressionism was a {{style of}} modern {{painting}} that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and minimalistic art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Gerhard Richter, A. R. Penck and Georg Baselitz, along with slightly younger artists like Anselm Kiefer, Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, Francesco Clemente, Damien Hirst, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, Keith Haring, and many others became known for <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> intense expressionist vein of painting.|$|E
25|$|PAs are {{employed}} by the United States Department of State as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP). PAs <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> capacity may be deployed {{anywhere in the world}} where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to U.S. government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their jobs is to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. FSHPs have some other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience in primary care.|$|E

25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her {{monochrome}} images {{due to their}} large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. The palette of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted {{with her left hand}} instead. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working with her left hand.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s saw {{a revival}} of {{interest}} in surrealism, with the most prominent poets <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field being Andrei Codrescu (born in 1946), Russell Edson (born in 1935) and Maxine Chernoff (born in 1952). Performance poetry also emerged from the Beat and hippie happenings, the talk-poems of David Antin (born in 1932), and ritual events performed by Rothenberg, to become a serious poetic stance which embraces multiculturalism {{and a range of}} poets from a multiplicity of cultures, including Puerto Rican born poets Giannina Braschi (born in 1953) and Julia de Burgos (born in 1914) who lived and wrote in New York City about the plight of the Hispanic-American immigrants. This mirrored a general growth of interest in poetry by African Americans including Gwendolyn Brooks (born in 1917), Maya Angelou (born in 1928), Ishmael Reed (born in 1938), Nikki Giovanni (born in 1943), and Detrick Hughes (born in 1966).|$|E
25|$|Psychologists {{have been}} working in medical {{settings}} for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed medical psychology). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services. While there were exceptions, {{he found that the}} psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.|$|E
