25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

500|$|For years, Ike & Tina Turner's success {{had made}} {{separation}} unthinkable. Back in 1956, 16-year-old Anna Mae Bullock {{was fascinated by}} Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. One night she grabbed the mike [...] and belted out the B.B. King standard ”You Know I Love You,” Ike was impressed and later invited her to join the band <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> money. In 1958 after Tina's mom put her and her infant son Craig out of the house, she moved into Ike's home in East St. Louis. During that period, Ike began musically training Tina. At the beginning, the two had no mutual attraction; Tina felt Ike was not the [...] "ideal-looking man" [...] and felt {{he was like a}} brother. Tina preferred light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. Ike viewed her as a sister and favored [...] "curvaceous women." [...] Ike was still married to his common-law wife, Lorraine Taylor, during this period.|$|E
500|$|As {{the years}} went by and the king became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour". Caroline was described as having been above average in height, [...] "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was [...] "haughty, sharp, irritable" [...] and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed to enjoy it, she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E
500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair up and down the stairs. She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E

500|$|Author Craig Crawford, in {{his book}} The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World (2007), {{describes}} Cher as [...] "a model of flexible career management", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture. He further explains that she billed [...] "each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellion—an image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent." [...] Author Grant McCracken stated, [...] "The term 'reinvention' is now often {{used to talk about}} the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [...] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [...] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom." [...] Her [...] "integrity" [...] and [...] "perseverance" [...] are highlighted in the Reaching Your Goals book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of self-actualization: [...] "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sonya's stalker was {{revealed}} to be her old school friend Erin Rogers (Adrienne Pickering). Erin broke into Sonya's home and admitted to sending the letters because she blamed Sonya for introducing her to drugs, which ruined her life. Morey commented, [...] "Erin represents {{what could have happened}} to Sonya if she didn't get out of that life." [...] After Erin was arrested, Toadie warned her to stay away from his family, while Sonya felt so guilty she paid Erin's bail. Sonya then vowed to make amends with Erin and helped her get a job at The Waterhole, but after Brennan exposed Erin as Sonya's stalker, she lost the job leaving Sonya [...] "to pick up the pieces once again". On Christmas Day, Sonya began thinking about how Erin would be spending the holiday, which prompted Brennan to find her the address of Erin's squat. Sonya visited Erin with some food, but Erin told her to leave as she did not need her charity. Sonya then made it clear that she would be there for Erin <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|Siddiqui was {{provided}} {{care for her}} wound while incarcerated in the US. In September 2008, a prosecutor reported to the court that Siddiqui had refused to be examined by a female doctor, despite the doctor's extensive efforts. On 9 September 2008, she underwent a forced medical exam. In November 2008, forensic psychologist Leslie Powers reported that Siddiqui had been [...] "reluctant to allow medical staff to treat her". Her last medical exam had indicated her external wounds no longer required medical dressing and were healing well. A psychiatrist employed by the prosecutor to examine Siddiqui's competence to stand trial, Gregory B. Saathoff, noted in a March 2009 report that Siddiqui frequently verbally and physically refused to allow the medical staff to check her vital signs and weight, attempted to refuse medical care once {{it was apparent that}} her wound had largely healed, and refused to take antibiotics. At the same time, Siddiqui claimed to her brother that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> medical treatment she did not get it, which Saathoff said he found no support for in his review of documents and interviews with medical and security personnel, nor in his interviews with Siddiqui.|$|E

Dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at a pinch, when Uncle Salters had a gurry-sore on his palm, could dress down by sense of touch. He could steer in anything short of half a gale from the feel of the wind on his face, humouring the [...] "We're Here" [...] just <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> it.
