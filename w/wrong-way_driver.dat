2500|$|For nearly 60 years, {{the only}} known chaser deaths were driving-related. The first was Christopher Phillips, a University of Oklahoma {{undergraduate}} student, killed in a hydroplaning accident when swerving to miss a rabbit in 1984. Three other incidents occurred when [...] was driving home from a hurricane chase in 2005, when Fabian Guerra swerved to miss a deer while driving to a chase in 2009, and when a <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver</b> resulted in a head-on collision that killed Andy Gabrielson returning from a chase in 2012. On 31 May 2013, an extreme event led to the first known chaser deaths inflicted directly by weather when the widest tornado ever recorded struck near El Reno, Oklahoma. Engineer Tim Samaras, his photographer son Paul, and meteorologist Carl Young were killed doing in situ probe and infrasonic field research by an exceptional combination of events in which an already large and rain-obscured tornado swelled within {{less than a minute}} to [...] wide simultaneously as it changed direction and accelerated. Several other chasers were also struck and some injured by this tornado and its parent supercell's rear flank downdraft. Three chasers were killed, two in one vehicle and one in another, when their vehicles collided in West Texas in 2017, bringing the total number of known traffic related fatalities to 7. There are other incidents in which chasers were injured by automobile accidents, lightning strikes, and tornado impacts. While chasing a tornado outbreak on 13 March 1990, KWTV television photographer Bill Merickel was shot and injured near Lindsay, Oklahoma.|$|E

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a study into wrong-way driving on motorways and is a follow-up to a previous study conducted in 1981 (See IRRD 258645). The objective of the current study was to gain an insight into source files available in the Netherlands that contain information about wrong-way accidents and to determine the quality of that information. The extent, nature and development of wrong-way driving in the Netherlands since 1980 as based on these source files are also discussed. During the 1991 to 1996 period, about 0. 1 % of all registered road accidents on motorways resulted from wrong-way driving. This percentage indicates that an annual average of 22 wrong-way accidents occurred during this time. Accidents involving wrong-way driving are serious in nature. During the dark, the percentage of wrong-way driving accidents {{of the total number of}} accidents on motorways is greater than during the day. Starting at age 55, the percentage of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers</b> involved in road accidents on motorways increases. Alcohol use by <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers</b> occurs relatively often, with the exception of the group of drivers aged 70 and older. Regarding the location at which drivers start driving in the wrong direction, little data is available. For the second part see C 11063 (IRRD 491578) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We present {{detection}} and tracking methods for highway monitoring based on {{video and audio}} sensors, and {{the combination of these}} two modalities. We evaluate the performance of the different systems on realistic data sets that have been recorded on Austrian highways. It is shown that we can achieve a very good performance for video-based incident detection of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers,</b> still standing vehicles, and traffic jams. Algorithms for simultaneous vehicle and driving direction detection using microphone arrays were evaluated and also showed a good performance on these tasks. Robust tracking in case of difficult weather conditions is achieved through multimodal sensor fusion of video and audio sensors. I...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drivers</b> {{who make}} <b>wrong-way</b> entries onto freeways pose a serious {{risk to the}} safety of other motorists and themselves. Wrong-way driving often leads to head-on collisions. Wrong-way crashes are {{relatively}} infrequent but are more likely to produce serious injuries and fatalities compared to other types of crashes. Driving the wrong way on freeways has been a nagging traffic safety problem since the interstate highway system was started in the 1950 s. Despite over forty years of highway design, marking, and signing improvements at freeway interchanges, the problem still persists. Several crashes in the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Fort Worth District have brought attention to the hazard of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers.</b> A search of newspaper articles revealed that the problem of wrong-way driving is not unique to Fort Worth and occurs throughout Texas. Members of the Fort Worth Traffic Management Team (TMT) identified locations with a history of wrong-way entries and assessed potential countermeasures. During this review process it was determined that research was needed to understand and develop effective countermeasures for wrong...|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{hundreds}} of fatal wrong-way driving (WWD) crashes occur across the United States. Thousands of injuries {{are reported in}} crashes caused by <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers.</b> Traffic control devices (TCDs), i. e., signs, pavement markings, and signals, have been introduced since 1935 to combat this problem. The aim of the paper {{is to provide a}} complete history of TCDs for deterring WWD on freeways and divided highways in previous versions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) (1935 – 2009). A fully referenced overview of definitions, text passages, and figures of the TCDs, employed to deter WWD in all MUTCD versions, will be given to characterize the changes over time. In addition, the efforts that have been made by state department of transportation (DOT) especially {{over the past few years}} to aggressively attack WWD by deploying standard TCDs are reviewed. Finally, the paper makes conclusions and recommendations with regard to the necessity of a revision in the next edition of MUTCD for WWD TCDs. The investigation of changes and the current practice leave a trail to enable traffic engineers and policy makers to consider past decisions and their effectiveness in combating WWD, as well as providing a reference to determine whether or not their jurisdiction meets the MUTCD standards...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{developments}} of on-board systems for automatic or semiautomatic driving include car collision avoidance systems. For this purpose two approaches based on pursuit-evasion differential games are compared. On a freeway a correct driver (evader) {{is faced with}} a <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver</b> (pursuer), i. e. a person driving {{on the wrong side}} of the road. The correct driver tries to avoid collision against all possible maneuvers of the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver</b> and additionally tries to stay on the freeway. The representation of the optimal collision avoidance behavior along many optimal paths is used to synthesize an optimal collision avoidance strategy by means of neural networks. Examples of simulations are presented which prove a satisfactory performance of the real-time collision avoidance scheme. 1. Introduction More than 3 000 cases where people drive {{on the wrong side of}} the road are officially registered on German freeways every year, but the actual number is estimated three to five time [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Wrong-way {{driving is}} a {{phenomenon}} that mainly happens on motorways. Although the number of wrong-way crashes is relatively limited, their consequences are much more severe than the consequences of other motorway injury crashes. The groups most often causing wrong-way driving accidents are young, inexperienced drivers and elderly drivers. Alcohol often plays a large role with the young; processing (visual) information is especially {{a problem with the}} elderly. Improved road signs and infrastructural measures must provide a driver with clarity to limit these crashes; measures that keep the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver</b> separated from other traffic must protect the other road users...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} was {{designed}} to analyze the traffic safety situation in India, and to identify countermeasures for areas in which the total harm caused by crashes can be substantially and readily reduced. The report focuses on two aspects of traffic safety in India: challenges and opportunities. The {{first part of the}} report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current traffic safety situation in India. It is pointed out in this analysis that fatality rates have increased both on highways and in urban areas during the past few years. Theoretical models suggest that the number of fatalities in India is not likely to start to decline {{for many years to come}} unless new policies are implemented. Based on the present analysis, the following six areas are identified as having potential for substantially reducing fatalities in India: (1) pedestrians and other non-motorists in urban areas, (2) pedestrians, other non-motorists, and slow vehicles on highways, (3) motorcycles and small cars in urban areas, (4) over-involvement of trucks and buses, (5) nighttime driving, and (6) <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers</b> on divided highways. The second part of the report outlines several promising countermeasures for each of these six areas. The third part of the report presents a brief comparison of major traffic safety challenges in India and China...|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{possibilities}} of displaying extra safety information on Dynamic Message Signs (DMSs) are explored. The technical possibilities for placing extra information on the signs are looked at, and the road safety effects are examined. The information to be displayed {{can be divided into}} two categories: (1) incident information, such as warnings for approaching road works, <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers,</b> fog, slipperiness, wind gusts, and accidents; and (2) general advice, such as wearing seat belts, using direction indicators, and keeping distance. From a technical view point, the Matrix Signalling Installations (MSIs) would seem to be the most obvious means of displaying incident information. These panels can display very localised information, however there is a very limited number of messages that can be displayed. The MSIs could be accompanied by panels displaying a number of pre-programmed words. For displaying general advice, the Dynamic Route Information Panels (DRIPs) seem to be the most suitable. Compared with MSIs, much more complex texts can be shown. For displaying extra information on DRIPs, however, an adaptation of the control system is essential. It seems that displaying incident information, in the form of adjusted speed limits on MSIs, results in behavioural adjustments. These adjustments are greater if the lower speed limits on MSIs are accompanied by a panel explaining the reason for the lower limit. No experimental research of the relationship between displaying general advice on DMSs and road safety has been done. Observations of, and interviews with, car drivers seem to indicate that drivers do not pay much attention to the general messages. However, the extra information {{does not seem to have}} any negative road safety effects either...|$|R
40|$|Wrong-way crashes are a {{major cause}} for safety concern along freeways and limited access facilities. This study {{investigated}} three {{different aspects of the}} use of Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) : 1) different settings of red RRFBs and their perceived effectiveness on reducing wrong-way driving based on a public opinion survey, 2) the effect of active red RRFBs on the behavior of drivers traveling on adjacent roadways via a before-and-after study, and 3) the effectiveness of red RRFBs on alleviating wrong-way driving on freeway off-ramps by analyzing the percentage of vehicles turning back after observing the red RRFB activation. Based on the public opinion survey results, the most informative warning red RRFB combination was determined and implemented in this study. The evaluation of the impact of red RRFB implementation (at six I- 275 off-ramps in Tampa, FL, USA) on driving behaviors along adjacent arterials indicated that the implementation of red RRFBs did not adversely impact driving behaviors on adjacent arterials. To determine the effectiveness of red flashing beacons and RRFBs on alleviating wrong-way driving on freeway off-ramps, video recordings of red flashing beacons and RRFBs mounted on wrong-way signs were analyzed. Red RRFBs were deemed to be a more effective countermeasure to deter wrong-way driving than red flashing beacons. Six-months of video data were collected for red flashing beacons mounted on wrong-way signs, and video data collection for red RRFBs mounted on wrong-way signs is currently underway. For red flashing beacons, a high percentage of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>drivers</b> in this study made a U-turn and went back in the correct traffic flow direction upon realizing they were traveling in the wrong direction. It is expected that red RRFBs will be more effective on alleviating wrong-way driving due to their capabilities to inform <b>drivers</b> of <b>wrong-way</b> driving than those from red flashing beacons. The video data analysis for red RRFBs will be presented in a separate paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{verification}} of evasive maneuvers for autonomous vehicles driving with constant velocity is considered. Modeling uncertainties, uncertain measurements, and disturbances can cause substantial deviations from an initially planned evasive maneuver. From this follows that the maneuver, which is safe under perfect conditions, might become unsafe. In this work, the possible set of deviations is computed with methods from reachability analysis, which allows to verify evasive maneuvers under {{consideration of the}} mentioned uncertainties. Since the presented approach has a short response time, it can be applied for real time safety decisions. The methods are presented for a numerical example where two autonomous cars plan a coordinated evasive maneuver {{in order to prevent}} a collision with a <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver.</b> I...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study was}} to gain insight into recent developments in the number of motorway accidents and reports to police stations. At the same time, the quality of the available information about <b>wrong-way</b> <b>driver</b> accidents was examined. Apart from an update of the 1997 study, the report also contains data on other (head-on) collisions on motorways, in which one of those involved were driving in opposite directions. New is the use of detailed official police reports. This data added more insight as to how wrong-way driving occurred. The study used the 1983 - 1998 accident databases. In order to make a comparison, a selection of all motorway accidents was made. However, this was only possible for 1991 - 1997. Analysis of the wrong-way driving accidents and victims presents a picture more or less the same as in the 1997 study...|$|E
