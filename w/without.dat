5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens <b>without</b> prey for 7days ("well-fed") and <b>without</b> prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens <b>without</b> prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, <b>without</b> the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done <b>without</b> any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed <b>without</b> ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas <b>without</b> natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, <b>without</b> synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and <b>without</b> GMOs.

Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies <b>without</b> reopening old wounds, they might {{have a chance to}} propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag <b>without</b> being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of the}} Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff <b>without</b> reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E
