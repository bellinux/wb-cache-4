5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a wooden}} {{model of the}} dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the {{building}} had reached {{the height of the}} drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was Giacomo della Porta. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.|$|E

25|$|The osteoderms of Saltasaurus {{consisted}} of numerous, large bony plates {{embedded in the}} dorsal skin, each surrounded by a pattern of smaller plates. The large osteoderms contained some hollow spaces for blood vessels and spongy trabecular bone, while the small ones were solid. Patches of skin from unidentified Cretaceous titanosaurs have revealed similar scale patterns in embryos (a large scale surrounded by ten smaller ones) but no bone or mineralized structure, suggesting that, like crocodiles, those saltasaurids that possessed armor only developed it some time after hatching. Analysis of the osteoderms of the titanosaur Rapetosaurus (not a member of Saltasauridae) revealed that the bones were hollow in adults, while those of juveniles were solid pieces {{similar to those in}} crocodiles. Paleontologist Kristina Curry Rogers, <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> discovery, theorized that the adult animals used their hollow osteoderms to store minerals during lean times. It is unknown whether any of the Saltasauridae used their osteoderms in a similar manner.|$|E
500|$|For meritorious {{achievement}} from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960.

500|$|Cotton and Wilkinson {{demonstrated}} that the 18-valence electron rhodium(III) rhodocenium cation + can be reduced in aqueous solution to the monomeric form; {{they were unable to}} isolate the neutral product as not only can it dimerise, the rhodium(II) radical monomer can also spontaneously form the mixed-hapticity stable rhodium(I) species [...] The differences between rhodocene and this derivative are found in two areas: (1) One of the bound cyclopentadienyl ligands has formally gained a hydrogen atom to become cyclopentadiene, which remains bound to the metal centre but now as a 4-electron η4- donor. (2) The rhodium(II) metal centre has been reduced to rhodium(I). These two changes make the derivative an 18-valence electron species. Fischer and colleagues hypothesised that the formation of this rhodocene derivative might occur in separate protonation and reduction steps, but published no evidence to support this suggestion. (η4-Cyclopentadiene)(η5-cyclopentadienyl)rhodium(I), the resulting compound, is an unusual organometallic complex in that it has both a cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself as ligands. It has been shown that this compound can also be prepared by sodium borohydride reduction of a rhodocenium solution in aqueous ethanol; the researchers <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> discovery characterised the product as biscyclopentadienylrhodium hydride.|$|E

500|$|Gordimer's {{response}} to the novel's unbanning was, [...] "I was indifferent to {{the opinions of the}} original censorship committee who neither read nor understood the book properly in the first place, and to those of the committee of literary experts <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> discovery, since both are part of the censorship system." [...] She attributed the unbanning to her international stature and the [...] "serious attention" [...] the book had received abroad. A number of prominent authors and literary organisations had protested the banning, including Iris Murdoch, Heinrich Böll, Paul Theroux, John Fowles, Frank Kermode, The Association of American Publishers and International PEN. Gordimer objected to the unbanning of the book because she felt the government was trying placate her with [...] "special treatment", and said that the same thing would not have happened had she been black. But she did describe the action as [...] "something of a precedent for other writers" [...] because in the book she had published a copy of an actual pamphlet written and distributed by students in the 1976 Soweto uprising, which the authorities had banned. She said that similar [...] "transgressions" [...] in the future would be difficult for the censors to clamp down on.|$|E
500|$|Laserblast has {{received}} largely negative reviews, and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "The only thing eerie about Laserblast is {{the thought that the}} people <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> loser are still running around loose." [...] In the review, Laserblast was described as [...] "an incomprehensible blending" [...] of popular recent films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a script [...] "so disordered we could not be certain that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the laser gun, which they compared to a cereal box prize. A review by Variety magazine said the special effects were decent, but the script [...] "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies. The Los Angeles Times critic Linda Gross said the script lacked [...] "credibility, psychological motivation and narrative cohesiveness", although she praised Terry Bowen's cinematography, saying it [...] "effectively captures the ambience of desert small-town life." [...] It was described as one of the worst films {{of the year in the}} book, The Golden Turkey Awards.|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{was clearly}} Stowe's magnum opus (although she {{considered}} Old Town Folks, {{which was written}} {{while she was in}} Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying [...] "So this is the little lady <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> big war?" [...] Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it [...] "uneven in quality and unstable in stance". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it [...] "downright offensive" [...] and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.|$|E

500|$|Prior to 1621, {{the only}} oath taken {{was that of}} {{obedience}} {{to the rules of}} the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting [...] "courtesy votes" [...] and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step voting procedure, since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> change in 1945.|$|E
500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; {{there seemed to be}} a conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to me that if this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear <b>who</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E
