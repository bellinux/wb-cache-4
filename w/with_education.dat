5|$|Arkwright's {{innovations}} {{were not}} confined to developing workers' settlements; he also had patents on many technologies used for water-powered spinning.

New Lanark in Scotland– also a World Heritage Site– was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley; Lanark {{was identified as a}} potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784. Dale later established four mills at Lanark; they were structurally similar to Arkwright's Masson Mill and {{at least two of the}} mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley, although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley. New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley, experimenting <b>with</b> <b>education</b> for young and old and social control. Saltaire– another World Heritage Site– was founded in 1853 and featured worker's housing and facilities, as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright.|$|E
30|$|When {{it comes}} to {{employees}} with different levels of education, and their attitudes, we find that employees <b>with</b> low <b>education</b> are more lenient towards sick leave and are more stressed than those <b>with</b> higher <b>education.</b> Those <b>with</b> higher <b>education,</b> on the other hand, report somewhat more gender equal attitudes and report being more positive to the welfare state. To investigate whether attitudes can explain the variation in sick leave between employees with high and low education, we regress Model (3). The results are presented in the middle panel of Table  5. Employees <b>with</b> low <b>education</b> have significantly more self-certified sick leave than employees <b>with</b> higher <b>education,</b> {{while there is no}} significant difference in GP-certified sick leave. When we control for attitudes in column (2), the coefficient on Low education reduces slightly.

5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review.

5|$|Education {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, {{between the end of}} the Middle Ages in the late fifteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment in the mid-eighteenth century. By the sixteenth century such formal educational institutions as grammar schools, petty schools and sewing schools for girls were established in Scotland, while children of the nobility often studied under private tutors. Scotland had three universities, but the curriculum was limited and Scottish scholars had to go abroad to gain second degrees. These contacts were {{one of the most important}} ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life.

Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when she ran out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education.

The Song government supported social welfare programs including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers' graveyards. The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service that was modeled on the earlier Han dynasty (202 BCE – CE 220) postal system to provide swift communication throughout the empire. The central government employed thousands of postal workers of various ranks to provide service for post offices and larger postal stations. In rural areas, farming peasants either owned their own plots of land, paid rents as tenant farmers, or were serfs on large estates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} labor supply elasticities {{of married}} {{men and women}} allowing for heterogeneity among couples (in educational attainments of husbands and wives) and explicitly modeling how household members interact and make labor supply decisions. We find that the labor supply decisions of husbands and wives are interdependent unless both spouses are highly educated (college or above). Couples <b>with</b> high <b>education,</b> the labor supply decisions of husband and wife are jointly determined only if they have pre-school age children. We also find that labor supply elasticities differ greatly between households. The participation own-wage elasticity is largest (0. 77) for women <b>with</b> low <b>education</b> married to men <b>with</b> low <b>education,</b> and smallest (0. 03) for women <b>with</b> high <b>education</b> married to men <b>with</b> low <b>education.</b> The participation own-wage elasticities for women <b>with</b> low <b>education</b> married to highly educated men and for women <b>with</b> high <b>education</b> married to highly educated men are similar and fall between these two extremes (about 0. 30 for each). For all types of couples, participation non-labor family income elasticity is small. We also find that participation cross-wage elasticities for married women are relatively small (less than - 0. 05) if they are married to men <b>with</b> low <b>education</b> and larger (- 0. 37) if they are married to highly educated men. Allowing for heterogeneity across couples yields an overall participation wage elasticity of 0. 56, a cross wage elasticity of - 0. 13 and an income elasticity of - 0. 006 for married women. The analysis in this paper provides a natural framework to study how changes in educational attainments and household structure affect aggregate labor supply elasticities...|$|R
