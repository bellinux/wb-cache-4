25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had <b>we</b> <b>hung?</b> Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Vainio {{collaborated with}} {{bodybuilder}} Kike Elomaa [...] when they sang {{together on the}} single Kunto nousee sullakin ("You'll Get in Shape Too"), with lyrics by Vainio. The B-side of the single was Pokkana ja paikallaan ("Serious and Still"), sung by Elomaa alone. A compilation album called Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is") followed in 1983, consisting {{of the most popular}} songs Vainio had himself recorded. 1985's Elämää ja erotiikkaa ("Life and Erotica") was Vainio's last finished studio album. Popular pieces from the album included Aleks ja Jaan ("Aleks and Jaan"), Heiskasen kanssa kun heiluttiin ("When <b>We</b> <b>Hung</b> Out with Heiskanen") and Yksinäinen saarnipuu ("Lonely Ash Tree").|$|E
500|$|A {{key point}} in Moore's career came {{when she was}} cast by Steven Spielberg to star as {{paleontologist}} Dr. Sarah Harding in —the sequel to his 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself [...] "tremendously". It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, [...] "There was so much hanging everywhere. <b>We</b> <b>hung</b> off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things... it was just non-stop." [...] The Lost World (1997) finished {{as one of the}} ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: [...] "Suddenly I had a commercial film career," [...] she said. The Myth of Fingerprints was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director Bart Freundlich. Later that year, Moore made a cameo appearance in the dark comedy Chicago Cab.|$|E

60|$|We were {{acquainted with}} a lodging-house slavey once--a real one, we mean. She was the handmaiden {{at a house}} in Bloomsbury where <b>we</b> once <b>hung</b> out. She was untidy in her dress, it is true, but she had not quite that {{castaway}} and gone-to-sleep-in-a-dust-bin appearance that we, an earnest student of the drama, felt she ought to present, and we questioned her one day on the subject.|$|R
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... <b>We</b> <b>hung</b> out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “When I {{went back}} to Havana a couple years later, {{the people in the}} hip-hop {{community}} came to see me and <b>we</b> <b>hung</b> out for a bit. They thanked me profusely and I said, 'Why?' and they said, 'Because your little conversation with Fidel and the Minister of Culture on hip-hop led to there being a special division within the ministry and we've got our own studio'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{the tracks}} {{featured}} backing vocals by the Coconuts, of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. In the words of Steve Lillywhite, [...] "they {{just happened to be}} in Dublin on tour, so <b>we</b> <b>hung</b> out with them and they came in and sang on 'Surrender'. So it was sort of random – this serious Irish rock band having the Coconuts on their album." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{were doing}} a session and <b>we</b> were <b>hung</b> for a tune and I said, [...] "Trane, why don't you think up some old standard?" [...] He said, [...] "OK I got it."...and they played [...] "Russian Lullaby" [...] at a real fast tempo. At the end I asked, [...] "Trane, what {{was the name of}} that tune?" [...] And he said, [...] "Rushin' Lullaby". I cracked up.|$|R
60|$|All {{this while}} the sail itself was flying about, {{sometimes}} catching over our heads, {{and threatening to}} tear us from the yard {{in spite of all}} our hugging. For about three quarters of an hour <b>we</b> thus <b>hung</b> suspended right over the rampant billows, which curled their very crests under the feet of some four or five of us clinging to the lee-yard-arm, as if to float us from our place.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Manley: [...] "Sylvia said “The white line, {{the white}} line’s gone. Stop!" [...] I {{just hit the}} brakes and I said “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stop.” And next thing <b>we</b> just <b>hung</b> off the gap...when I swung the door open, I could see, more or less, see the water...and I just swung meself towards {{the back of the}} car and grabbed the {{headrest}} like that to pull myself around. There's a big automatic transmission pan underneath car - that's what it balanced on." ...|$|R
2500|$|She {{attended}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1955 {{where she}} became an honor student in modern history, English, and Spanish. She also joined the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, where she sang with another choir member and classmate, Neil Diamond. Diamond recalls, [...] "We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. <b>We</b> <b>hung</b> {{out in the}} front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes." [...] The school was near an art-movie house, and he recalls that she was always aware of the films they were showing, while he wasn't as interested.|$|E
2500|$|He {{remembered that}} on January 2, 2006, just after exiting the mantrip, [...] "the mine filled quickly with fumes and thick smoke and that {{breathing}} conditions were nearly unbearable...." [...] At least {{four of the}} rescuers' emergency oxygen packs were not functioning. [...] "I shared my rescuer with Jerry Groves, while Toler, Jesse Jones and Tom Anderson sought help from others. There were not enough rescuers to go around." [...] Because of the bad air, they [...] "had to abandon our escape attempt {{and return to the}} coal rib, where <b>we</b> <b>hung</b> a curtain to try to protect ourselves. The curtain created an enclosed area of about 35 feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diamond {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family descended from Russian and Polish immigrants. His parents were Rose (née Rapaport) and Akeeba [...] "Kieve" [...] Diamond, a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was {{stationed}} in the army. In Brooklyn he attended Erasmus Hall High School {{and was a member}} of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club along with classmate Barbra Streisand. They were not close friends at the time, Diamond recalls: [...] "We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. <b>We</b> <b>hung</b> out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes." [...] After his family moved he then attended Abraham Lincoln High School, and {{was a member of the}} fencing team. For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you're like me in that, Bessy," [...] said Mrs. Pullet; [...] "and I {{think it}} 'ud be a deal more {{becoming}} o' Jane if she'd have that pier-glass rubbed oftener,--there was ever so many spots on it last week,--instead o' dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had, and telling 'em what they're {{to do with}} their money. But Jane and me were allays contrairy; she would have striped things, and I like spots. You like a spot too, Bessy; <b>we</b> allays <b>hung</b> together i' that." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Penny Lane' {{was kind}} of nostalgic, {{but it was really}} a place that John and I knew; it was {{actually}} a bus terminus. I’d get a bus to his house and I’d have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so <b>we</b> often <b>hung</b> out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that we both knew, and so we both knew the things that turned up in the story. - Paul McCartney, discussing [...] "Penny Lane" [...] in a 2009 interview with Clash magazine ...|$|R

2500|$|The 9th {{participated in}} {{building}} the Union fortification at the summit of Cheat Mountain {{during the winter of}} 1861, according to Bierce, who said the following about this after a visit in 1909: [...] "Here we slew the forest and builded us giant habitations (astride the road from Nowhere to the southeast) commodious to lodge and army and fitly loopholed [...] for discomfiture of the adversary. The long logs that it was our pride to cut and carry! The accuracy with which we laid them one upon another, hewn to the line and bulletproof. The Cyclopean doors that <b>we</b> <b>hung,</b> with sliding blots fit to be the 'mast of some great admiral!' And when we had 'made the pile complete' some marplot of the Regular Army came that way and chatted a few moments with our commander, and we made an earthwork away off {{on one side of the}} road (leaving the other side to take care of itself) and camped outside it in tents! But the Regular Army fellow had not the heart to suggest the demolition of our Towers of Babel, and the foundations remain to this day." ...|$|E

6000|$|When we {{returned}} to Hooksett, a week afterward, the melon man, in whose corn-barn <b>we</b> had <b>hung</b> our tent and buffaloes and other things to dry, was already picking his hops, with many women and children to help him. We bought one watermelon, the largest in his patch, to carry with us for ballast. It was Nathan's, which he might sell if he wished, having been conveyed {{to him in the}} green state, and owned daily by his eyes. After due consultation with [...] "Father," [...] the bargain was concluded,--we to buy it at a venture on the vine, green or ripe, our risk, and pay [...] "what the gentlemen pleased." [...] It proved to be ripe; for we had had honest experience in selecting this fruit.|$|R
60|$|We all {{walked through}} the grounds with Viola, and when <b>we</b> parted she <b>hung</b> about my neck and assured me that now she had seen me she should not grieve half so much, and, let mamma say what she would, {{she could not be}} sorry; and I had no time to fight over the battle of the sorrow being for wrongdoing, not for reproof, for the pony would bear no more last words.|$|R

5000|$|He was {{involved}} in the family business, Amway, even as a child. [...] "I still remember when it was in the basement of our home when I was growing up," [...] he later said. [...] "I remember the offices being down there and people working down there." [...] As boys, he and his brother Doug were [...] "tapped as mini-hosts", assigned to greet attendees at Amway's annual conventions, and they [...] "helped out with everything from clearing plates during gatherings to ferrying guests to play tennis or waterski. That evolved to speaking in front of groups and even giving product demonstrations." [...] DeVos later said that [...] "It was kind of like a Junior Achievement atmosphere contained inside of Amway. ... <b>We</b> just <b>hung</b> around the company. It was your social activity." ...|$|R

5000|$|Spinks died at {{his home}} in Essex on 26 April 2012, after a long illness. More than 200 ex-boxers, {{including}} Bobby Neill and several more of Terry's former opponents, attended his funeral in West Ham. Author and sports historian Norman Giller, his long-time friend, said in the eulogy: [...] "Terry hung up his gloves in 1962 but <b>we</b> have never <b>hung</b> up our memories {{of one of the most}} accomplished fighters to come out of the East End boxing factory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Luka, {{there is}} nothing to do but to try and get at that venison. I have been {{thinking}} that it will be easiest to try from below; it is much quicker work chopping out the solid snow than it is trying to make a hole in that loose stuff at the surface. The tree was just about in a line with the front of the tent, wasn't it? and <b>we</b> <b>hung</b> the deer on a branch that stretched out nearly as far as the tent. I should say <b>we</b> <b>hung</b> it about half-way along that branch and not above twelve feet from the tent." ...|$|E

60|$|It seemed {{necessary}} to break camp {{in order not}} to be eaten up by the Siwash dogs, whose peculiarities grew upon me daily. They were indeed strange beasts. They seemed to have no youth. I never saw them play; even the puppies were grave and sedate. They were never in a hurry and were not afraid. They got out of our way with the least possible exertion, looking meekly reproachful or snarling threateningly at us. They were ever watchful. No matter how apparently deep their slumber, they saw every falling crumb, they knew where <b>we</b> had <b>hung</b> our fish, and were ready as we turned our backs to make away with it. It was impossible to leave anything eatable for a single instant. Nothing but the sleight of hand of a conjurer could equal the mystery of their stealing.|$|R

These were only rumors, after all, for the rotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles; but the rotunda does figuring, too, when at length the problem is reduced to a simple equation, with Bijah Bixby as x.
