After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, King Edward's authority was once more weakened, and the rebellious barons took over control of government. For Warwick the triumph was brief; he died the next year.|$|E

5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, {{who was in charge}} of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>custody</b> on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.|$|E

Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>custody</b> on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.|$|E

5|$|By 26 April, {{the complex}} at Obersalzberg was {{under attack by}} the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler {{expelled}} Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, {{as president of the}} Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and {{he made his way to}} the American lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Russians. He <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>custody</b> near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 2012, {{soon after}} Chen escaped house arrest, plainclothes {{security}} agents forced {{entry into the}} home of his eldest brother, Chen Guangfu. Believing that the elder brother had information on Chen's escape, police took him to a police station for interrogation, and reportedly chained his feet, slapped him, and struck him with a belt. Police officers then allegedly returned to the family's home and proceeded to beat Guangfu's wife and son. His son, Chen Kegui, pulled a knife and slashed at three of the officers, causing minor injuries. He <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>custody</b> and faces criminal charges for attempted murder. On 24 May, it was reported that Chen Guangfu had escaped to Beijing from his guarded village to advocate on behalf of his son. In November 2012, Chen Kegui was sentenced to more than three years in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Long Parliament proved just as {{difficult}} for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> <b>custody</b> on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he consequently {{fled to the}} Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.|$|E
