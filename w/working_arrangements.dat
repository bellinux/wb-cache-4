All levels government, as well as all major political parties in the country, pledged complete support for the bid and endorsed the conduct of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil. On June 23, 2008, the Brazilian president formed the Government Action Management Committee, under the patronage of the Minister of Sport Orlando Silva, which coordinated Federal government actions during the bid process. Another act created the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) on January 17, 2009, to coordinate public services and infrastructure delivery for eventual Games in Rio de Janeiro, based in the pioneer model developed by Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Under legal aspects, the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) would be the entity responsible for planning and staging the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. According to the IOC, the existing legislation was sufficient to enable the organization of the Games and would be amended or modified to suit the Olympic Charter if needed. The Ministry of External Relations and the Ministry of Labor guaranteed the entry, exit and <b>working</b> <b>arrangements</b> for Games personnel. People in possession of a valid passport and an Olympic or Paralympic Identity and Accreditation Card, in lieu of a visa, will be able to enter the Brazilian territory.|$|E

This was mostly done by guaranteeing those shareholders an income on their capital, which meant no immediate cash was required. When the lines started working, suddenly a huge periodical payment was required, and the income was inadequate to satisfy it. There were also suggestions of improper share acquisitions, and in the period 1848 to 1850 a number of shareholder inquiries disclosed bad practices, and many board members had to resign in February 1850.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the flexible <b>working</b> time <b>arrangements</b> in Bulgaria, using a life-course perspective. Two important features have to be outlined, namely: underdeveloped flexible forms of employment in the country, including <b>working</b> time <b>arrangement,</b> and lack of previous analysis on flexible <b>working</b> time <b>arrangements</b> from the angle of life-course perspective. The author describes the regulatory framework, collective agreements at national and company level as a frame within which different forms of flexible <b>working</b> time <b>arrangements</b> by gender develop. The study points out that there are no significant gaps concerning work engagement under different working time schemes. It is mentioned that the existing legal frame gives relatively good opportunities for the flexible <b>working</b> time <b>arrangement</b> to be in practice. However, crossing the issue of flexibility in <b>working</b> time <b>arrangement</b> with <b>working</b> life cycle, the author outlines more gender differences, e. g. more young people in flexible types of employment; more women employed part-time, etc. ...|$|R
