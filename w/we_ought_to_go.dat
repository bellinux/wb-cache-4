500|$|Fueled {{in large}} part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season, Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll. A few {{commentators}} picked the Bulldogs as a possible [...] "sleeper team" [...] to make the Final Four. Stevens was not so sure, privately telling his father, [...] "We have a really good team, and I’m not sure how far we can go this year, but next year, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> really far." ...|$|E
2500|$|At around 2:30p.m., Grant {{spoke with}} Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, a classmate of his from West Point. [...] "General Sherman {{seems to be}} having a hard time," [...] Grant observed. [...] "It seems as if <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> help him." [...] He decided to send Wood's and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's {{divisions}} against the Confederate rifle pits {{at the base of the}} ridge, hoping to concern Bragg and relieve the pressure on Sherman. Grant suggested his idea to Thomas, but personal relations between the two generals were chilly during the campaign and Thomas rebuffed Grant's ideahe had no intention of attacking until he was assured that Hooker was successfully attacking the enemy's flank. Meanwhile, IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger was nearby, completely absorbed in the activities of a battery of artillery.|$|E

60|$|CHRISTINE. Well, for heaven's sake, {{speak to}} Bill again, mother! <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> all <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on our knees to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{little thing}} makes trouble. And we always drift round {{to the same}} discussion; whether <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> really <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And we've always gone our own way, and {{not looked}} {{out for the}} future. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> out more, and had people come to the house. Nobody comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up and fulfil {{the duties}} of society," [...] said Robina, rising. [...] "But first, Bear, tell me how is Phyllis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{out and do}} rescue work, oughtn’t we?” said Latimer, {{with the}} {{instinct}} of a Parliamentary candidate for getting into the local limelight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{that is not}} Mr. Strong's voice," [...] {{said the}} Sylphide, still half laughing. [...] "Grady my coat!--Bonner, who is Grady my coat? <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what I think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do? <b>Go</b> back home and {{telephone}} to the villages and towns in the direction the biplane took. Somebody must have seen the craft,--if she kept in the air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm mighty glad of it," [...] {{returned}} Tom, with a beaming face. [...] "I think <b>we</b> all <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off and celebrate. What's {{the matter}} with a trip to Coney Island, or something like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Susan {{answered}} the question. [...] "We {{are on our}} way back from the Palace, miss. I am afraid," [...] she said, timidly, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] exclaimed Mr. Poplington, {{striking}} {{his hand}} on the table, [...] "I'll tell you exactly how <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through that country--we ought to go on cycles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how are we}} to proceed? {{which way}} are we to go? I have not the most distant idea as to what {{direction}} <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in our search." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{she looked}} round, but I didn't notice much. A hansom {{came along and}} we got into it. It was not till then that Clement told me who she was: I {{remember}} he {{said that she was}} there for no good. I suppose <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>gone</b> back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{are we to}} find time," [...] I say, [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> all {{the places}} that <b>we</b> really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to--to all the cafes and theatres and music-halls and beer-gardens and dancing-saloons {{that we want to}} visit--if you waste half the {{precious}} day loafing about churches and cathedrals?" ...|$|R
6000|$|...

5000|$|On the August 22, 2005 {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson said of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez: I don't {{know about this}} doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that <b>we</b> really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead and do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war, and I don’t think any oil shipments will stop.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Father, <b>ought</b> <b>we</b> not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on {{at once to}} Ethelberta's, {{instead of}} waiting?' said Sol, on {{reaching}} the vestry, still in ignorance. ''Twas no use in coming here.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{feel like}} going much further," [...] said Snap. [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> back. See, it is {{starting}} in to snow," [...] he added, as the flakes began to fall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guy," [...] she said, turning towards him, [...] "we ought {{never to}} have come here. Lady Medlincourt has a perfect right to ask these questions. Until we can answer them <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were given. [...] "It's all our giddy admiration," [...] said Stalky. [...] "You {{know how}} we love you, Tulke. We {{love you so much}} <b>we</b> think you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home and die. You're too good to live, Tulke." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{she does}} go, I shall be very sorry," [...] he said; [...] "but I do not wish, of course, to upset her plans. We must {{talk to her}} about it to-night. I suppose <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, in a Republican {{presidential debate}} at Dartmouth College, McCain opposed {{the legalization of}} marijuana. He said, [...] "We’re losing the war on drugs. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> say, 'It’s not a war anymore,' or <b>we</b> really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after it.
