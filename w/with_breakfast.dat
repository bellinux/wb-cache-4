5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, <b>with</b> <b>breakfast</b> trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

Mick, Shirley and Babe are ordered to pay a fine. When Sylvie belittles Babe, she leaves Sylvie by the canal in the rain, although Sylvie is found and Shirley realises that Babe left Sylvie to die and disowns her.

Mick ejects Babe from the Vic and she curses the family, hoping they lose everything.|$|E

Captain Randall Davis was named commanding officer. He arrived on 1 December, {{two weeks before the}} first class of 1,050 enlisted recruits were to start their five-weeks of basic training. [...] The recruit training routine began each weekday with Reveille at 5:30 or 6:00 A.M.; breakfast at 6:30 A.M.; classes and drill for four hours before lunch, and classes and drill for another four hours in the afternoon. [...] Followed by an hour of free time, dinner, and two hours of study or instruction, lights out at 10:00 P.M. Captain's Inspection on Saturday morning, then free time until taps.

2500|$|Breakfast clubs can be {{especially}} valuable for children whose parents {{are not able to}} afford to provide them with regular morning meals. [...] They can provide both short and long term health benefits. Children who receive breakfast often perform better at learning, and can also be better behaved. Breakfast clubs can also improve the child's long term health by providing a well balanced nutritious meal. [...] Secondary benefits of breakfast clubs include improving attendance, helping to prevent disadvantaged children from experiencing social isolation, and helping with children who would otherwise not have adult supervision in the first hour or so before school. A significant majority of teachers hold the view that school breakfast clubs are beneficial in achieving educational goals.. For example, [...] in a 2013 survey of 552 teachers, [...] 387 [...] (71%) said they believed breakfast clubs {{have a positive effect on}} pupil's concentration, [...] but four teachers (0.7%) said it had a negative impact. Questioned about the impact on behavior, [...] 325 (60.2%) were positive, while 11 (2%) said breakfast clubs have a negative effect. Older research from 2007 found that in certain circumstances a majority of children were unhappy <b>with</b> <b>breakfast</b> clubs: when either there was insufficient care given to ensure the clubs were stimulating enough to avoid boredom, [...] or when access had been restricted just to poorer children, which could leave participants feeling picked on.|$|E
