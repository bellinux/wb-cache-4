5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|After {{the song}} was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice were {{struggling}} to find a suitable musical actress for the songs and the titular role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, {{had moved to the}} United States. One day they <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> British musical television show, Rock Follies, where they noticed actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like Godspell, and her acting abilities in Rock Follies convinced Rice and Lloyd Webber to sign her for Evita.|$|E

25|$|The Unitarian Universalist church {{hosted a}} youth {{performance}} of Annie Jr. Some 200 people <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> performance by 25 children when Adkisson entered {{the church and}} opened fire on the audience. 60-year-old Greg McKendry, a longtime church member and usher who deliberately {{stood in front of}} the gunman to protect others, was killed at the scene. A 61-year-old woman, Linda Kraeger, died from wounds suffered during the attack later that night. Kraeger was a member of Westside Unitarian Universalist Church in Farragut.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's {{visit to}} China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news {{agencies}} to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals {{of the protesters}} helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who <b>were</b> <b>watching.</b> <b>The</b> Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang, having begun earlier than the Soviets to radically reform the economy, was open to political reform, {{but not at the}} cost of a potential return to the disorder of the Cultural Revolution.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the UVF {{joined the}} Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) and {{indicated}} its acceptance of moves towards peace. However, the year {{leading up to}} the loyalist ceasefire, which took place shortly after the Provisional IRA ceasefire, saw some of the worst sectarian killings carried out by loyalists during the Troubles. On 18 June 1994, UVF members machine-gunned a pub in the Loughinisland massacre in County Down, on the basis that its customers <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Ireland national football team playing in the World Cup on television and were therefore assumed to be Catholics. The gunmen shot dead six people and injured five.|$|E
25|$|On 19 August 1978 at the Cinema Rex in Abadan, Iran, {{hundreds}} of people <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> Deers when, at 20:21, four men barred {{the doors of the}} cinema and doused it with petrol from a can. The fire started outside three entrance doors to the main hall, after the attackers allegedly dropped a match into the petrol. The attackers then fled and blocked the doors from the outside. Some people attempted to escape by the roof. None of the three tankers sent by the fire department had water and the police department, only 100 metres away, did not respond in a timely manner.|$|E
25|$|By 7 October, Napoleon's corps {{had reached}} the Danube and secured {{crossing}} points. When {{he became aware of}} the French threat, Mack made the questionable decision to stand at Ulm. To oppose the French, Mack organized his army into four corps under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg with 28 infantry battalions and 30 cavalry squadrons, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck with 30 battalions and 24 squadrons, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer with 19 battalions and 34 squadrons, and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic with 15,000 in 16 battalions, six Jäger companies, and six squadrons. Schwarzenberg massed at Ulm, Werneck defended Günzburg, and Kienmayer held Ingolstadt. Meanwhile, Jellacic's troops held a line farther south near Biberach an der Riß where they <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Black Forest. Mack apparently made no preparations to defend the line of the Danube. Instead, he planned to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication stretching back to France.|$|E

25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} {{broadcast}} as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal {{the end of the}} experiment, and the world.|$|E

500|$|However, not all reviews were favorable. Brian Lowry from Variety {{gave the}} series a mixed review, stating that {{he enjoyed the}} action {{sequences}} but that [...] "the soapier elements mostly fall flat", and called the series [...] "painfully old-fashioned". Mike Hale, from The New York Times, called the series [...] "average" [...] and [...] "good on the action, a little muddled on the ideas". He added that [...] "the tone is placid and slightly monotonous, as if we <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Walton family {{at the end of}} the world".|$|E

500|$|The constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, {{the great}} and little bears, are named for their {{supposed}} resemblance to bears, {{from the time of}} Ptolemy.

Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since Paleolithic times, in the widespread Cosmic Hunt myths.

500|$|... "The hucksters' huckster," [...] David Halberstam labeled him, [...] "whose {{greatest}} {{legacy to}} television was {{a program called}} The Beverly Hillbillies, a series so demented and tasteless that it boggles the mind" [...] Columnist Murray Kempton described The Beverly Hillbillies as, [...] "a confrontation of the characters of John Steinbeck with the environment of Spyros Skouras," [...] the extravagant chairman of Twentieth Century Fox.

500|$|In {{the hours}} before the AFC Championship Game, the Denver Broncos <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> NFC Championship Game on the JumboTron at Mile High Stadium to see who they would play in Super Bowl XXXIII should they defeat the New York Jets. Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan {{expressed}} surprise at Anderson's missed kick, and running back Terrell Davis said that the Falcons' subsequent victory put the Broncos in the mindset that they had [...] "won the Super Bowl already," [...] as their greatest potential challenge had been eliminated. This distraction nearly cost the Broncos the game against the Jets, as the Broncos played a very poor game.|$|E
