5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method <b>works</b> <b>well</b> with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, <b>works</b> <b>well</b> for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E

We compared several prior methods on samples from the Wikipedia and the EuroParl collections.

5|$|Whitney {{falls for}} Connor, but {{after it is}} {{revealed}} that Connor {{has been in a}} sexual relationship with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and Whitney, Bianca attacks him and turns herself in to the police. Whitney and Carol argue over Connor, and Whitney feels she is not wanted by her family so decides to move out, and stays with Ryan's estranged wife Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks). Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) offers Whitney a work trial at The Vic for a job, but catches her giving free drinks to Janine. Despite this, she lets Whitney off, telling her she is a natural, and <b>works</b> <b>well</b> at the till. When Kat catches her stealing again, she sacks Whitney, leaving Janine angry with Whitney. After Whitney sees Janine successfully pickpocket someone, she decides to try it herself, but ends up being hit in the face. A man called Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) helps her, buys her food and returns her to Albert Square, giving her his phone number. Whitney tries to kiss Max, causing her to fall out with Lauren. She also argues with Carol, rejects Ricky and is rejected by Liam, Tiffany and Morgan for ruining Ricky's birthday cake days earlier. Upset, Whitney contacts Rob and asks to stay with him, which he accepts. She throws her phone away and tells nobody that she is going. Janine lies about Whitney's whereabouts but when she admits she does not know where Whitney is, Lauren and Janine attempt to find her, and Lauren sees her in Dartford going into a club. Lauren goes back with her to her bedsit, but Whitney does not want to go, saying she and Rob are in love. Lauren is then thrown out by Rob. Whitney has sex with a man called Chris (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Whitney has been having sex with Rob's friends to pay off his debts to them. Janine tries to get Whitney to come home but she refuses, and Rob ejects Janine. Rob then drags Whitney {{out of the house and}} into his car, while Janine and Lauren see them driving off. They go to a house where Whitney meets another woman Chloe (Georgia Henshaw) who is being exploited. Whitney tells Rob she wants to leave, but he says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He locks her in a room so she breaks the window and escapes, stopping a car and asking for help, while Rob shouts after her.|$|E

As a result, we showed that Shleifer-style yardstick competition, which can <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under the static model, cannot <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under the dynamic model. On the other hand, franchise bidding may <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under certain conditions. Thus, we showed that franchise bidding is superior to yardstick competition...|$|R
