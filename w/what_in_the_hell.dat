Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun.

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> could I have done, what could have anybody have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E

And looking at the ashen fields and the putty roads, he {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of <b>Hell</b> he could do {{to get out of this}} prickly sense of disgust and physical repulsion.

Throughout this preliminary the students of both colleges gave their respective yells and sung their several songs written for the occasion.
