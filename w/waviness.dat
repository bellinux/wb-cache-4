5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some <b>waviness</b> on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface <b>waviness.</b> This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard <b>waviness</b> criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the <b>waviness,</b> RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface <b>waviness</b> was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E
25|$|Cold judder, on {{the other}} hand, {{is the result of}} uneven disc wear {{patterns}} or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: <b>waviness</b> and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, <b>waviness</b> results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{reflectivity}} {{of water}} is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light {{such as those that}} occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, <b>waviness</b> causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the <b>waviness</b> of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E

2500|$|Bearing {{balls are}} {{manufactured}} {{to a specific}} grade, which defines its geometric tolerances. The grades range from 2000 to 3, where the smaller the number the higher the precision. Grades are written [...] "GXXXX", i.e. grade 100 would be [...] "G100". and lack of defects, such as flats, pits, soft spots, and cuts. The surface smoothness is measured in two ways: surface roughness and <b>waviness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While {{a finite}} thermal contact {{conductance}} {{is due to}} voids at the interface, surface <b>waviness,</b> and surface roughness, etc., [...] a finite conductance exists even at near ideal interfaces as well. [...] This conductance, known as thermal boundary conductance, {{is due to the}} differences in electronic and vibrational properties between the contacting materials. [...] This conductance is generally much higher than thermal contact conductance, but becomes important in nanoscale material systems.|$|E
2500|$|Borzois {{are large}} Russian sighthounds that {{resemble}} some central Asian breeds {{such as the}} Afghan hound, Saluki, and the Kyrgyz Taigan. Borzois can generally be described as [...] "long-haired greyhounds". [...] Borzois come in virtually any colour. The borzoi coat is silky and flat, often wavy or slightly curly. The long top-coat is [...] quite flat, {{with varying degrees of}} <b>waviness</b> or curling. The soft undercoat thickens during winter or in cold climates, but is shed in hot weather to prevent overheating. In its texture and distribution over the body, the borzoi coat is unique. There should be a frill on its neck, as well as feathering on its hindquarters and tail.|$|E
2500|$|Hot judder {{is usually}} {{produced}} {{as a result}} of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop. It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around [...] to about , which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or hot spots. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort {{it in such a way}} that produces a sinusoidal <b>waviness</b> around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) comes in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.|$|E
60|$|These wonders strange be sees, {{and many}} more, Whose head is {{pregnant}} with poetic lore. Should he upon an evening ramble fare With forehead to the soothing breezes bare, Would he naught see but the dark, silent blue With all its diamonds trembling through and through: Or the coy moon, {{when in the}} <b>waviness</b> Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress, And staidly paces higher up, and higher, Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire? Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight-- The revelries, and mysteries of night: And should I ever see them, I will tell you Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you.|$|E
60|$|His {{hair was}} chestnut-brown, {{glinting in the}} candle-light to gold, and the hint of <b>waviness</b> in it {{explained}} the perceptible droop to his tawny moustache. For the rest, his face was clean-shaven and cut on a good masculine pattern. At first she found fault with the more than slight cheek-hollows under the cheek-bones, but when she measured his well-knit, slenderly muscular figure, with its deep chest and heavy shoulders, she discovered that she preferred the hollows; at least they did not imply lack of nutrition. The body gave the lie to that; while they themselves denied the vice of over-feeding. Height, five feet, nine, she summed up from out of her gymnasium experience; and age anywhere between twenty-five and thirty, though nearer the former most likely.|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room and came over close to his side, resting her arm upon the mantelpiece. She was still wearing her walking-dress, prim and {{straight}} in its folds about her tall, graceful figure, and her hair, save for the slight <b>waviness</b> about the forehead, was plainly dressed. There were none of the cheap arts about her to which Trent had become accustomed in women who sought to attract. Yet, as she stood looking down at him, a faint smile, half humorous, half satirical, playing about {{the corners of her}} shapely mouth, he felt his heart beat faster than ever it had done in any African jungle. It was the nervous and emotional side of the man to which she appealed. He felt unlike himself, undergoing a new phase of development. There was something stirring within him which he could not understand.|$|E
60|$|Mr Rubb came, and {{she looked}} anxiously at his dress. He had on bright yellow kid gloves, {{primrose}} he would have called them, but, if there be such things as yellow gloves, they were yellow; and she wished {{that she had the}} courage to ask him to take them off. This was beyond her, and there he sat, with his gloves almost as conspicuous as Mr Maguire's eye. Should she, however, ever become Mrs Rubb, she would not find the gloves to be there permanently; whereas the eye would remain. But then the gloves were the fault of the one man, whereas the eye was simply the misfortune of the other. And Mr Rubb's hair was very full of perfumed grease, and sat on each side of his head in a conscious arrangement of <b>waviness</b> that was detestable. As she looked at Mr Rubb in all the brightness of his evening costume, she began to think that she had better not. At last Miss Baker came, and they started off together. Miss Mackenzie saw that Miss Baker eyed the man, and she blushed. When they got down upon the doorstep, Samuel Rubb, junior, absolutely offered an arm simultaneously to each lady! At that moment Miss Mackenzie hated him in spite of her special theory.|$|E
60|$|I stood {{staring at}} the portrait, I say, {{with a kind of}} fascination that {{astonished}} me, seeing that it had come to me in such a way. It was no French face of my imagination, and as I looked {{it seemed to me that}} I knew Mademoiselle Helene de Saint-Gre. And yet I smile as I write this, realizing full well that my strange and foreign surroundings and my unforeseen adventure had much to do with my state of mind. The lady in the miniature might have been eighteen, or thirty-five. Her features were of the clearest cut, the nose the least trifle aquiline, and by a blurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon the head a suggestion of <b>waviness.</b> The eyebrows were straight, the brown eyes looked at the world with an almost scornful sense of humor, and I marked that there was determination in the chin. Here was a face that could be infinitely haughty or infinitely tender, a mouth of witty--nay, perhaps cutting--repartee of brevity and force. A lady who spoke quickly, moved quickly, or reposed absolutely. A person who commanded by nature and yet (dare I venture the thought?) was capable of a supreme surrender. I was aroused from this odd revery by footsteps on the gallery, and Nick burst into the room. Without pausing to look about him, he flung himself lengthwise on the bed on top of the mosquito bar.|$|E
60|$|Yet all {{the same}} there is an {{excellent}} reason why one should shun beauty in a prospective wife, at anyrate obvious beauty--the kind of beauty people talk about, and which gets into the photographers' windows. The common beautiful woman has a style of her own, a favourite aspect. After all, she cannot be perfect. She comes upon you, dazzles you, marries you; {{there is a time}} of ecstasy. People envy you, continue to envy you. After a time you envy yourself--yourself of the day before yesterday. For the imperfection, the inevitable imperfection--in one case I remember it was a smile--becomes visible to you, becomes your especial privilege. That is the real reason. No beauty is a beauty to her husband. But with the plain woman--the thoroughly plain woman--it is different. At first--I will not mince matters--her ugliness is an impenetrable repulse. Face it. After a time little things begin to appear through the violent discords: little scraps of melody--a shy tenderness in her smile that peeps out at you and vanishes, a something that is winning, looking out of her eyes. You find a <b>waviness</b> of her hair that you never saw at the beginning, a certain surprising, pleasing, enduring want of clumsiness in part of her ear. And it is yours. You can see she strikes the beholder with something of a shock; and while the beauty of the beauty is common for all the world to rejoice in, you will find in your dear, plain wife beauty enough and to spare; exquisite--for it is all your own, your treasure-trove, your safely-hidden treasure....|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{parameters}} for expressing <b>waviness</b> height, {{the most common}} being Wa & Wt, for average <b>waviness</b> and total <b>waviness,</b> respectively. [...] In the lateral direction along the surface, the <b>waviness</b> spacing, Wsm, is another parameter that describes the mean spacing between periodic <b>waviness</b> peaks. There are numerous measurement settings which influence these resultant parameter values, which are mentioned below. One {{of the most important}} is the <b>waviness</b> evaluation length, which is the length in which the <b>waviness</b> parameters are determined. Within this length the <b>waviness</b> profile is determined. This is a surface texture profile that has the shorter roughness characteristics filtered out, or removed; it also does not include any profile changes due to changes in workpiece geometry that are either unintentional (flatness) or intentional (form).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Waviness</b> {{measurements}} {{are not as}} common as roughness measurement however there are important applications. For example, <b>waviness</b> in bearing balls and bearing races {{is one of the}} reasons for vibrations and noise in ball bearings. Other application examples are <b>waviness</b> in flat milled sealing surfaces, [...] "orange peel" [...] on painted surfaces, and chatter on round shaft surfaces.|$|E

50|$|To {{obtain the}} surface {{characteristic}} almost all measurements {{are subject to}} filtering. It {{is one of the}} most important topics when it comes to specifying and controlling surface attributes such as roughness, <b>waviness,</b> and form error. These components of the surface deviations must be distinctly separable in measurement to achieve a clear understanding between the surface supplier and the surface recipient as to the expected characteristics of the surface in question. Typically, either digital or analog filters are used to separate form error, <b>waviness,</b> and roughness resulting from a measurement. Main multi-scale filtering methods are Gaussian filtering, Wavelet transform and more recentlty Discrete Modal Decomposition. There are three characteristics of these filters that should be known in order to understand the parameter values that an instrument may calculate. These are the spatial wavelength at which a filter separates roughness from <b>waviness</b> or <b>waviness</b> from form error, the sharpness of a filter or how cleanly the filter separates two components of the surface deviations and the distortion of a filter or how much the filter alters a spatial wavelength component in the separation process.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Waviness</b> is the {{measurement}} of the more widely spaced component of surface texture. It is a broader view of roughness {{because it is more}} strictly defined as [...] "the irregularities whose spacing is greater than the roughness sampling length". It can occur from machine or work deflections, chatter, residual stress, vibrations, or heat treatment. <b>Waviness</b> should also be distinguished from flatness, both by its shorter spacing and its characteristic of being typically periodic in nature.|$|E
