It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

He begs the player to find his lost company, who passed through Rammas Deluon: a great series of statues that weaken (or even kill) those who pass it. After destroying the spirits within them, the player becomes able to resist the power of Rammas Deluon, and finds a hidden Dwarf settlement, where {{a part of the}} scattered party lives.|$|E

500|$|On October 2, 2009, Carey {{performed}} a four-track set list on NBC's Today. She began with her 1992 single [...] "Make It Happen", followed by [...] "Obsessed" [...] and [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> Love Is". She concluded with [...] "H.A.T.E.U."

500|$|... "Obsessed" [...] {{peaked at}} number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, {{becoming}} Carey's 27th top-ten {{hit on the}} chart. In terms of total top-ten chart entries among all artists in the chart's history, Carey tied for fifth place after the song's peak, with Janet Jackson and Elton John. Internationally, the song was not released throughout parts of Europe, as Island Records decided to give priority to the album's second single, Carey's cover of Foreigner's classic [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> Love Is". [...] "Obsessed" [...] peaked within the top 10 in France and Italy, and in the top 20 in Australia, Belgium, Canada and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happens next". He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active {{in the development of}} humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was [...] "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, which is pretty much where [...] is at now." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and written by creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Glen Mazzara. Mazzara teased the episode {{in a conference call}} with various journalists: [...] "We're proud of this finale, we've been building to it all season, and we can't wait for you to see it. [...] There's more bloodshed coming. They thought they were safe on this farm, they were wrong. [...] We're on a killing spree here. [...] There are answers {{about the nature of the}} virus in the finale. [...] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> comes next.

500|$|CBS senior {{journalist}} Danna Walker stated, [...] "There is {{criticism that}} it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> happened to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May25, in spite of bad weather, a crowd {{gathered}} in the Plaza de la Victoria, as did the militia led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti. They demanded the recall of the Junta elected the previous day, the final resignation of Cisneros, and {{the appointment of a}} new junta that did not include him. Historian Bartolomé Mitre stated that French and Beruti distributed blue and white ribbons, similar to the modern cockade of Argentina, among those present. Later historians doubt it, but consider it possible that the revolutionaries used distinctive marks of some kind for identification. It was rumored that the Cabildo might reject Cisneros' resignation. Because of delays in issuing an official resolution, the crowd became agitated, clamoring that [...] "the people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is going on!".|$|E

500|$|On September 25, 2007, Representative John Conyers (D), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, {{announced}} that he would hold congressional hearings on what he described as [...] "the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in Jena, Louisiana," [...] with the goal of pressuring the United States Department of Justice into taking action. The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, [...] "Shame on you.... As a parent, I'm on the verge of tears," [...] and said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!" [...] US Attorney Washington responded that the federal government had a limited role to play in the matter.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{it is like to}} experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to {{turn a blind eye to}} it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|In the United States, the remix {{peaked at}} number twenty-six on the Adult Contemporary chart, {{becoming}} her twenty-eighth career entry and Ne-Yo's first.

The remix also peaked at number ninety on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Elsewhere, the track peaked at number eighty-nine in Japan and number ninety on the UK Singles Chart, but reached number twenty-eight on the UK R Chart.

[...] During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared [...] "Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World." [...] At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water.

500|$|The track next {{appeared}} on the set list for Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, as the closing song. Joined by a choir and singer Cee Lo Green, Madonna in a black robe sang as the stadium was lit with white light. It was also added to the set list for The MDNA Tour the same year. Performed in a gospel version, Madonna and 36 of her back-up singers {{played the role of}} a choir and wore long robes, as images of a gothic church and Hebrew letters {{appeared on}} the backdrops. Jim Harrington from The Oakland Tribune gave the overall concert a negative review but stated that [...] "It wasn't until the last two songs—"Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Celebration"—that the whole deal finally clicked". Timothy Finn from The Kansas City Star was particularly impressed with the backing choir, calling it [...] "the best use of one since Foreigner's 'I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> Love Is". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman had a {{supporting}} role in the 2012 comedy film Wanderlust, with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. The film focuses on an overworked couple who end up at a commune {{when they try to}} slow things down. Åkerman played Eva, a woman at the commune. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who were divided regarding its humour, but ultimately praised the cast. Wanderlust underperformed at the box office, earning just over $20 million worldwide during its theatrical run. Åkerman appeared in the comedy film The Giant Mechanical Man, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 23, 2012, to average reviews. She had {{a supporting}} role in the 2012 rock musical film Rock of Ages, based on the stage production of the same name. She played Constance Sack, a journalist who interviews Tom Cruise's character Stacee Jaxx. She hired a vocal coach as her role required her to sing; she and Cruise recorded a duet of Foreigner's [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> Love Is" [...] (1984).

[...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, {{there was going to be}} a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created.

500|$|The Diamondback, the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward {{for moving}} the team into one dormitory, which forced some other {{students}} out. Ward {{stated that the}} move was done {{on the advice of}} Kehoe—which Kehoe denied—and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and {{sent a letter to the}} American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:"I don't know who's right or wrong, but...I don't think it's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what happened.

500|$|Mariah Carey's twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, was {{released}} in 2009. It produced the US Billboard Hot 100 top ten and platinum certified track [...] "Obsessed". However, subsequent single releases failed to replicate its success, with [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> Love Is" [...] peaking at number 60 on the Hot 100, and [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] reaching number 72 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Carey revealed that she intended to re-release Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel as a remix album in early 2010, titled Angels Advocate, which would consist of remixes of the standard songs with new featured artists, including Mary J. Blige, Snoop Dogg, Trey Songz, R. Kelly, T-Pain, Gucci Mane and OJ da Juiceman. A release date of February 23, 2010, was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. [...] "Angels Cry" [...] and [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel were released as remixes with Ne-Yo featuring on the former and Nicki Minaj on the latter.
