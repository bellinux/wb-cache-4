30|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} visual stimulation by wooden room interiors {{have also been}} reported. Tsunetsugu et al. [62 – 64] investigated the difference in physiological effects of visual stimulation by rooms with different designs and proportions of <b>wood.</b> Actual <b>rooms</b> (13  m 2) were built for the study. Living rooms in Japan typically contain approximately 30 % wood in their structure. For this study, four actual rooms (all with area 13  m 2) were built: a typical wooden living <b>room</b> (30 % <b>wood),</b> a <b>room</b> with extra <b>wood</b> added to the walls (45 % <b>wood),</b> and a <b>room</b> where {{almost all of the}} wall and the entire floor and ceiling were covered with wood (90 % wood). Fifteen male university students aged between 19 and 28  years were exposed to the visual stimulation of each room interior for 90  s. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were continuously measured as an index of physiological reaction. Visual stimulation by the 30 % <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> reduced the participants’ diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate, suggesting that this room induced physiological relaxation effects. In contrast, visual stimulation by the 45 % <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> increased pulse rate. In a 30 % <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> with added wooden pillars and crossbeams (a designed room taking the total wood content to 40 %), the participants’ pulse rates increased {{in a manner similar to}} that in the room with 45 % wood, indicating a state of physiological wakefulness. In the participants’ subjective evaluations, they rated all the wooden room interiors as “comfortable”. These findings demonstrated that variations in the percentage of wood and the design of a wooden living room induced different physiological changes, and suggested that visual stimulation by a room with 30 % wood, which is a standard type of living room commercially available in Japan, induced a physiological relaxation effect.|$|R

Adjoining the Big Room and within the old mill building is the <b>Wood</b> <b>Room.</b> This room features a more lively acoustic and a booth, mezzanine floor and movable acoustic screens.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of adjustable process parameters on wood loss and bark removal in tumble drum debarking. The effect of capacity on the size distribution of the chips was studied {{in order to determine}} the optimal capacity for both the debarking and chipping sub-processes. The final aim was to propose a control strategy to optimise the processes by adapting their parameters according to the quality of the raw material. When the research started, earlier automation systems had focused on keeping the process alive, and economic values such as wood loss were not considered important. The process is usually controlled manually and shifts have different ways to manage it, which are based on trial and error. Bark removal in chemical pulp mills is usually higher than the values recommended in the literature, which in turn causes log breaking in the drum and increases wood loss. Even a small reduction in wood loss could have a substantial financial outcome. The lack of raw materials some time ago and the recession nowadays have highlighted the importance of more efficient log use. Data survey techniques were employed to reveal the interactions between drum variables from noisy measurements. <b>Wood</b> <b>room</b> data were analysed by modelling and deriving conclusions from the resulting parameters. In addition, log breaking and the size distribution of the chips were analysed under different process conditions. A pilot-scale drum was used to study residence time and the mechanical abrasion of logs. The results of this work indicated that the ratio of the volume of logs in the drum to capacity determines the residence time of the logs in the drum. Other variables influence the volume of logs in the drum, which together with capacity determine the residence time of logs in the drum, which affects wood loss and bark removal. The effect of capacity on the size distribution of the chips was not unambiguous, however, and it was therefore recommended to operate <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> at high capacity, because this reduces wood loss and increases annual production. The proposed control strategy adapts the residence time of logs in the drum to the quality of the debarked raw material by controlling the position of the closing gate. In addition, the control strategy adjusts the rotating speed of the drum using an open loop control. The results can be used to optimise the <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> process parameters. If the problem in <b>wood</b> <b>room</b> is excessive debarking, the residence time of the logs can be reduced and the rotating speed of the drum lowered. In this way the logs will be damaged less and wood loss will be reduced. Bark removal requirements in mechanical pulp mills are high, and the process parameters can be adapted to avoid problems in the subsequent processes due to excessive bark...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rural {{settlements}} of LuGuLake in Yunnan province have {{an original}} architectural characteristics —Wooden houses which {{are shaped by}} the climate and topographic conditions, local materials, and the social living style. But because of the typical well-dry type construction of the wooden houses which need more massive lumbers to be constructed, it leads to {{the disappearance of the}} luxuriant forest. The other building materials such as tamped earth, bricks and stones, reinforce concrete replace the wood materials. The research’s goal is to solve the ecology problem which was brought by <b>wood</b> <b>rooms</b> built by lumbers and the compatible problem between the new houses built by modern materials and vernacular architecture in LuGu Lake...|$|R

50|$|The {{recording}} process {{took longer}} than expected originally. The drums were originally recorded in Pete Riley's old studio. The guitars {{were recorded in}} Govan's house by running his amp through a Palmer speaker simulator. The band intended to keep those tracks but, producer Jan Cyrka insisted that they should record the drums again, this time in a better studio. After they did that, the guitars that were recorded at Govan's home did not sound good enough by comparison. It was then when Paul Cornford decided to fly the band to Hollywood in order to record the guitars in Richie Kotzen's studio. This time, the guitar were recorded through mic'd loudspeakers in a <b>wood</b> <b>room.</b> The result were much better recorded guitar tracks than what was originally expected by Govan.|$|R

The man walks over to the woman and puts his arm around her. After a while she gets up and starts walking away, but then the ropes come off around everyone (the band and the couple alike). As a result, all of the couple's body parts lie on the floor. One of the man's hands crawls over to the one of the woman's hands to give her a needle with thread in it to sew both of them back up while the band ends the song.|$|R

The business developed rapidly, and already in 1907 the men bought a lot for larger premises in Aura riverside close to Korppolaismäki.
