Dr. Kaare Ulbak of the Danish National Institute of Radiation Protection said, [...] "We have very good registers for cancer incidents and cancer mortality and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> very thorough investigation." [...] The workers said the lack of proof was attributable to the lack of appropriate medical monitoring. As of November 2008, the case has been unsuccessful.

500|$|In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy {{to reduce}} its 300-member staff, suspecting {{that many of them}} were spies. The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, [...] "What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> Socialist revolution under their noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.|$|E

[...] BLM Director Neil Kornze said that [...] "Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public." ...|$|E

[...] "There are some practical, pragmatic decisions made. If you’re playing to a crowd who are not very familiar with you, there's no point of going too deep but we do always make sure we play a new song. Like on Guns N' Roses [...] we had fifty minutes which is ten songs all in. So, you know we just made sure that in those ten songs we played 'Deeply Ordered Chaos' which we’re proud of and it makes a certain statement. And it just alerts people to the fact that, yes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> record in the last 30 years. You know and that’s a good thing. Psychologically, that's the blood transfusion that we need. And we're very mindful, we have a very loyal fan base. We don’t pander as you well know." ...|$|E

2500|$|The benign {{intentions}} of the United States were also argued by John Bright and Richard Cobden, strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain. [...] Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations [...] "before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> representation to the American Government, before we have heard a word from it in reply, [...] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?" [...] Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings {{that he could not}} attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.|$|E
