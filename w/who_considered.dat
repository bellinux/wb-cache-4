5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the Cherokee and Creek {{had begun to}} compete for the same {{resources}} and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap.

Archaeological evidence has been discovered that tends to back the story of the battle, but the date of the battle and its participants are still disputed.|$|E
40|$|Insurance is a {{co-operative}} (contractual) system {{among people}} {{to carry out}} the results of tort that may happen to anyone of them and pay his losses and damages. Insurance began with a co-operative nature then ended up as commercial (business). Islamic scholars (Imams), addressed Insurance because it is new and it was imported to our societies. Scholars had different pointviews about Insurance, which were divided mainly to: 1 - Those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> insurance Halal (accepted). 2 - Those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> insurance Haram (forbidden). 3 - Those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> commercial insurance done by companies as Haram and suggest co-operative and governmental insurance (social security). 4 -Those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> insurance Haram (forbidden) and suggest Islamic insurance in two stages. 5 - Those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> insurance Hara...|$|R

5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> her his {{favourite}} sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote {{the first draft of}} The Man with the Golden Gun.

5000|$|Carl Linnaeus {{named the}} {{domestic}} cat Felis catus in 1758; Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named the wildcat Felis silvestris in 1775. For taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> these {{two kinds of}} cat a single species the Principle of Priority means that the species ought to be named F. catus, but in practice almost all biologists have used F. silvestris. In 2003, the Commission issued a ruling (Opinion 2027) that [...] "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated, by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms", confirming F. silvestris for the wild cat. Taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat the same species as the wild cat should use F. silvestris; taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat a subspecies of the wild cat should use F. silvestris catus; taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat a separate species should use F. catus.|$|R
5|$|The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May 1217.

5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, {{particularly}} in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E

5|$|To appease those <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> her sex to be {{the most}} serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed {{masculine}} titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen.

5|$|While imprisoned and {{awaiting}} execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby {{of perjury}} {{with regard to}} the alleged 1824 meeting between them. Many believed Beauchamp's accusation was meant to curry favor with New Court governor Joseph Desha – <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> Darby a political enemy – and to secure a pardon from him. When Beauchamp finished the confession in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer for immediate publication. An Old Court supporter, the printer refused to publish it.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E

According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E
5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} {{known for their}} use of direct {{response}} advertising on television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on the start of football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million spent by FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was spent by DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a negative reaction from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Following the NDH's establishment, Đujić {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Ustaše. As {{early as}} April, Đujić's Chetnik's began killing and mutilating Croats {{in retaliation for}} the wave of Ustaše atrocities against Serb communities across the NDH around the same time. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month, centered mainly around Knin. By mid-month, his Chetniks were launching raids against communist-held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> him a filibuster. His Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings, sparing the local Serb population from further massacres.|$|E

5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on reports by the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that those three ships suffered 760 casualties in total. These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E
5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E
