The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} {{relatively}} easy to measure, the wing-tip trajectories have been reported more frequently. For example, selecting only flight sequences that produced enough lift to support a weight, <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the wing tip follows an elliptical shape. Noncrossing shapes were also reported for other insects. Regardless of their exact shapes, the plugging-down motion indicates that insects may use aerodynamic drag in addition to lift to support its weight.|$|E
25|$|Wright however {{does not}} hold the view that good works {{contribute}} to one's salvation but rather that the final judgement is something we {{can look forward to}} as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgement <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>that.</b> Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E

25|$|They {{say that}} when the {{battered}} bodies of the star-crossed lovers were finally found, they were still locked in each other's arms. Noble, even in deepest mourning for his lost Lillinonah, Chief Waramaug ordered that his daughter and her white lover be buried side by side, contrary to Indian tradition, {{on the top of}} a hill overlooking the narrow gap of the Housatonic River now known as Lover's Leap. And when old Waramaug finally joined his ancestors many sad years later, legend says that he, too, was laid to rest near the ill-fated couple. Though the tragic life of Lillinonah ended centuries ago, her legend will never be forgotten. Any Connecticut map <b>will</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the wide portion of the Housatonic River which stretches for miles below the narrow rapids where the lovers met their deaths is, to this day, still called Lake Lillinonah.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the accounting}} {{relationships between the}} financial and the real economy. It <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> accounting can clarify the nature of economic phenomena and be an important building block for economic theory. The paper will {{argue that there is}} much confusion about key macroeconomic concepts like saving, investment and finance. This confusion is best summarised in the statement "saving finances investment". After clearly defining the accounting relationships between lending, financial saving and physical investment it <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> this is a nonsense statement. The theory behind it - the loanable funds theory - will be analysed and critiqued. It <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the loanable funds theory confuses the concepts of income and production, lending and saving, and financial saving and non-financial saving. It <b>will</b> further be <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> this has not only theoretical but also important policy implications...|$|R

The main focus will be on wave equations with one or two inhomogeneities. It <b>will</b> be <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> the fronts come in families. The front solutions provide a parameterisation of the length of the inhomogeneities in terms of the local energy of the potential in the inhomogeneity. The stability of the fronts is determined by analysing (constrained) critical points of those length functions.
