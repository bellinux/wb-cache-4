500|$|David Hinckley of the New York Daily News {{noted that}} the complex storyline and darker themes seen in [...] "A Canterlot Wedding" [...] would make it appeal just as well to older viewers, and made the episode also feel {{relatively}} ambitious for a children's show. Hinckley and Michelle Profis of Entertainment Weekly {{noted that the}} episode's timing was also close to the one-year anniversary of the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Entertainment Weekly writer Hilary Busis, reporting about the [...] "invitation" [...] that appeared in The New York Times to promote the episode, noted that [...] "Having seen it myself, I can concur; the hour-long special is ambitious, absorbing, and thoroughly entertaining, even to those who stopped playing <b>with</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Ponies back in the mid-'80s. (Or, you know, never played with them at all.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Teenage {{and adult}} fans have shown {{interest}} in clothing with {{images from the}} show; Erin Comella, brand manager for My Little Pony, said that these fans are [...] "literally dressed in the brand". Hasbro has been providing its licensed clothing vendors such as Hot Topic <b>with</b> <b>My</b> <b>Little</b> Pony-themed shirts and other apparel for all genders and multiple age groups. In part of the older fanbase, Hasbro has come to consider My Little Pony as a [...] "lifestyle" [...] brand, and , has arranged over 200 licenses across fifteen categories of products. According to Julie Duffy, Hasbro's vice president of global brand publicity, while their primary market is the young demographic, [...] " [...] found ways to strike the right balance by working with licensees to offer [...] adult fans exciting merchandise geared just for them". Though Hasbro has not revealed how much of My Little Pony product sales are bolstered by the brony fandom, Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post suggests that the continued success of the franchise four years after its introduction is tied in part to bronies' interest in the show and products, and Hasbro's williness to market products towards the adult audience.|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, the {{decorative}} arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., [...] "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," [...] was jointly created by William Morris, Madox Brown, Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home. Jane Morris directed the embroidery arm, and Georgiana was employed painting tiles, but {{with the birth of}} her son Philip in October of that year she gave up the art studio to become a full-time caregiver. [...] "I remember the feeling of exile with which I now heard through its closed door the well-known voices of friends together with Edward's familiar laugh, while I sat <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>little</b> son on my knee and dropped selfish tears on him as 'separator of companions and the terminator of delights'". [...] As late as 1868 she was still attempting to learn to etch but none of her work was published.|$|E
2500|$|Y2K {{was also}} {{exploited}} by some prominent and other lesser known fundamentalist and Pentecostal Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia. Their {{promotion of the}} perceived risks of Y2K was combined with end times thinking and apocalyptic prophecies {{in an attempt to}} influence followers. The New York Times reported in late 1999, [...] "The Rev. Jerry Falwell suggested that Y2K would be the confirmation of Christian prophecy - God's instrument to shake this nation, to humble this nation. The Y2K crisis might incite a worldwide revival that would lead to the rapture of the church. Along with many survivalists, Mr. Falwell advised stocking up on food and guns". Adherents in these movements were encouraged to engage in food hoarding, take lessons in self-sufficiency, and the more extreme elements planned for a total collapse of modern society. The Chicago Tribune reported that some large fundamentalist churches, motivated by Y2K, were the sites for flea market-like sales of paraphernalia designed to help people survive a social order crisis ranging from gold coins to wood-burning stoves. Betsy Hart, writing for the Deseret News reported {{that a lot of the}} more extreme evangelicals used Y2K to promote a political agenda in which downfall of the government was a desired outcome in order to usher in Christ's reign. She also noted that, [...] "the cold truth is that preaching chaos is profitable and calm doesn't sell many tapes or books" [...] These types of fears and conspiracies were described dramatically by New Zealand-based Christian prophetic author and preacher Barry Smith in his publication, [...] "I Spy <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>Little</b> Eye", where he dedicated a whole chapter to Y2K. Some expected, at times through so-called prophecies, that Y2K would be the beginning of a worldwide Christian revival. It became clear in the aftermath that leaders of these fringe groups had cleverly used fears of apocalyptic outcomes to manipulate followers into dramatic scenes of mass repentance or renewed commitment to their groups, additional giving of funds and more overt commitment to their respective organizations or churches. The Baltimore Sun noted this in their article, [...] "Apocalypse Now - Y2K spurs fears", where they reported the increased call for repentance in the populace in order to avoid God's wrath. Christian leader, Col Stringer, in his commentary has published, [...] "Fear-creating writers sold over 45 million books citing every conceivable catastrophe from civil war, planes dropping from the sky to the end of the civilised world as we know it. Reputable preachers were advocating food storage and a [...] "head for the caves" [...] mentality. No banks failed, no planes crashed, no wars or civil war started. And yet not one of these prophets of doom has ever apologised for their scare-mongering tactics." [...] Some prominent North American Christian ministries and leaders generated huge personal and corporate profits through sales of Y2K preparation kits, generators, survival guides, published prophecies and a wide range of other associated merchandise. Christian journalist, Rob Boston, has documented this in his article [...] "False Prophets, Real Profits Religious Right Leaders' Wild Predictions of Y2K Disaster Didn't Come True, But They Made Money Anyway".|$|E
