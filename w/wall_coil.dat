40|$|In this Thesis work two {{different}} passive techniques for {{the enhancement of}} the convective heat transfer in single phase duct flow are studied: the heat transfer performance of coiled tubes having smooth and corrugated wall is experimentally investigated. The curvature heat transfer augmentation effect {{is due to the}} fact that the fluid flowing inside the pipe experiences the centrifugal force that promotes a secondary flow: local maxima in the velocity distribution that locally increases the temperature gradients at the wall by then maximizing the heat transfer, are induced. The enhancing effect in corrugated pipes is mainly due to the macroscopic mixing of the fluid, activated by the destabilization of the flow which leads to the early onset of the transfer mechanism associated to the transitional regime. This issue becomes particularly important in industrial applications in which the thermal processing of medium and high viscosity fluids is required, such as in the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries where the momentum transfer mechanism is necessarily laminar and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer apparatuses in which the fluids are conveyed is inevitably penalized. The first part of this work concerns the estimation of the average heat transfer performances along the heated length of the coiled pipes in terms of Nusselt number circumferentially averaged along the cross section and computed at different axial position. In addition the heat transfer augmentation is compared to the correlated pressure drop penalties. In the second part of this work, with the aim to deeply investigate the mechanisms that govern the heat transfer in coiled pipes, the solution of the IHCP in the wall, starting from the temperature distribution acquired on the external wall surface, is employed to estimate the local convective heat-transfer coefficient on the interior wall surface along the cross section. Three different solution procedures, based on Tikhonov Regularization Method (TRM), Gaussian Filter Technique (GFT) and Quadrupole method (QM) are presented, implemented and optimized for the problem under study. The different approaches are validated, throughout their application to synthetic data and then applied to the experimental data regarding laminar fully developed region in the smooth coiled tubes.

Although the dissolver vessel and coil corrode during dissolution operations, the high acid conditions are not consistent with the formation of ferrous oxides (i. e., orange/rust-colored corrosion products). In a subsequent investigation, SRNL performed dissolution experiments to determine if residues from the nylon bags used for Pu containment could have generated the orange discoloration following dissolution. When small pieces of a nylon bag were placed in boiling 8 M nitric acid solutions containing other components representative of the H-Canyon process, complete dissolution occurred almost immediately.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals for the DIII-D {{research}} program is to establish an advanced tokamak plasma with high bootstrap current fraction that can be sustained in-principle steady-state. Substantial {{progress has been made}} in several areas during the last year. The resistive wall mode stabilization has been done with spinning plasmas in which the plasma pressure has been extended well above the no-wall beta limit. The 3 / 2 neoclassical tearing mode has been stabilized by the injection of ECH into the magnetic islands, which drives current to substitute the missing bootstrap current. In these experiments either the plasma was moved or the toroidal field was changed to overlap the ECCD resonance with the location of the NTMs. Effective disruption mitigation has been obtained by massive noble gas injection into shots where disruptions were deliberately triggered. The massive gas puff causes a fast and clean current quench with essentially all the plasma energy radiated fairly uniformly to the vessel walls. The run-away electrons that are normally seen accompanying disruptions are suppressed by the large density of electrons still bound on the impurity nuclei. Major elements required to establish integrated, long-pulse, advanced tokamak operations have been achieved in DIII-D: {beta}{sub T} = 4. 2 %, {beta}{sub p} = 2, f{sub BS} = 65 %, and {beta}{sub N}H{sub 89 } = 10 for 600 ms ({approx} 4 {tau}{sub E}).

Therefore, biologic long-term prognosis seems to be doubtful, and the physical effect of coils may be important. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the physical effect of coils on pressure and flow dynamics in aneurysms. METHODS: Bifurcation aneurysms were created in eight rabbits, explanted after 3 weeks, and tested in a model with pulsatile perfusion with 0. 9 % saline and heparinized blood. Before and after densely packing with coils, systemic and intraaneurysmal pressure, aneurysmal pul-sation, and impact measurements were recorded. RESULTS: The peak and shape of the pressure waves in the aneurysm and in the delivery system were not significantly different before and after coiling. Under physiological intraaneu-rysmal pressure (while being perfused with saline), significant reduction (P 5. 022) of aneu-rysmal <b>wall</b> pulsation after <b>coil</b> embolization was noted.

Laser-Doppler measurements of the instantaneous streamwise velocity, us, and the cross-stream circumferential velocity, u^,, components were obtained along the midplane of the pipe cross-section. The Reynolds number range explored was 3800 < Re < 10500 (890 < De < 2460) and spans the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Time integration of the velocity records has yielded previ-ously unavailable mean and rms velocity profiles. In the range 5060 < Re < 6330, the time records of the velocity components reveal periodic flow oscillations with St ~ 0. 25 in the inner half of the pipe cross-section while the flow near the outer wall remains steady.

The electromagnetic techniques for measuring soil humidity (by resistivity) {{has been known for}} a long time. It can be used to measure walls moisture. Conductivity is preferable in inductive techniques, as instrumentation readings are generally directly proportional to conductivity and inversely proportional to resistivity. The operating principle of this method is: a Tx coil transmitter, supplied with alternatingcurrent at an audio frequency, is placed on the <b>wall.</b> An Rx <b>coil</b> receiver is located at a short distance, s, (on the wall) away from the Tx coil.

40|$|An {{improved}} readout scheme {{has been}} proposed for high-resolution thermometers, (HRTs) based {{on the use of}} superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to measure temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibilities. The proposed scheme would eliminate counting ambiguities that arise in the conventional scheme, while maintaining the superior magnetic-flux sensitivity of the conventional scheme. The proposed scheme is expected to be especially beneficial for HRT-based temperature control of multiplexed SQUIDbased bolometer sensor arrays. SQUID-based HRTs have become standard for measuring and controlling temperatures in the sub-nano-Kelvin temperature range in a broad range of low-temperature scientific and engineering applications. A typical SQUIDbased HRT that utilizes the conventional scheme includes a coil wound on a core made of a material that has temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range of interest. The core and the coil are placed in a DC magnetic field provided either by a permanent magnet or as magnetic flux inside a superconducting outer <b>wall.</b> The aforementioned <b>coil</b> is connected to an input coil of a SQUID. Changes in temperature lead to changes in the susceptibility of the core and to changes in the magnetic flux detected by the SQUID. The SQUID readout instrumentation is capable of measuring magnetic-flux changes that correspond to temperature changes down to a noise limit. 0. 1 nK/Hz 1 / 2. When the flux exceeds a few fundamental flux units, which typically corresponds to a temperature of. 100 nK, the SQUID is reset. The temperature range can be greatly expanded if the reset events are carefully tracked and counted, either by a computer running appropriate software or by a dedicated piece of hardware...|$|R
40|$|The simple, tubular {{foraminifer}} Glutameandrata vallieri n. gen., n. sp. is formally described from Spring Creek, one of {{the most}} fossiliferous Late Triassic localities of North America (Martin Bridge Formation, Wallowa terrane, Oregon, USA). Uncoiled in the final stage, this new benthic form displays an initial meandrospiroid arrangement, a coiling mode typically observed in coeval porcelaneous foraminifers. Yet, we demonstrate through a comparative study of diagenetic results that the wall of G. vallieri n. gen., n. sp. is, in fact, finely agglutinated. Agglutinated meandrospiroid foraminifers, here encompassed by the family Glutameandratidae n. fam., are sporadically but continuously observed in Triassic-Recent rocks. Their potential phylogenetic relationships and their significance to define the relative taxonomic importance of <b>wall</b> characteristics versus <b>coiling</b> mode are discussed. For over a century, optical differences in the wall appearance of agglutinated and porcelaneous foraminifers have been used for taxonomic distinction, with moderate success in the fossil record. Parameters and processes controlling these optical differences remain partly unclear and the exact boundary between these two types of walls is still indefinite. Calcite-cemented calc-agglutinated tests and porcelaneous agglutinating tests only differ in fine details of the microstructure and composition of the wall, related to differences in the wall morphogenesis. With diagenesis, these details are progressively obliterated, often hindering correct taxonomic assignments. We here provide criteria allowing the distinction between porcelaneous and calcareous agglutinated tests in the fossil, up to a high level of thermal maturation. The walls of porcelaneous and agglutinated foraminifers are not equally affected by diagenetic effects and subtle structural differences in the wall outline persist up to a significant level of test alteration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the combustion of Illinois coal in the blast furnace injection process in a new and unique pilot plant test facility. This investigation is significant to the use of Illinois coal in that the limited research to date suggests that coals of low fluidity and moderate to high sulfur and chlorine contents are suitable feedstocks for blast furnace injection. This study is unique in that it is the first North American effort to directly determine the nature of the combustion of coal injected into a blast furnace. It is intended to complete the study already underway with the Armco and Inland steel companies and to demonstrate quantitatively the suitability of both the Herrin No. 6 and Springfield No. 5 coals for blast furnace injection. The main feature of the current work is the testing of Illinois coals at CANMET`s (Canadian Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology) pilot plant coal combustion facility. This facility simulates blowpipe-tuyere conditions in an operating blast furnace, including blast temperature (900 C), flow pattern (hot velocity 200 m/s), geometry, gas composition, coal injection velocity (34 m/s) and residence time (20 ms). The facility is fully instrumented to measure air flow rate, air temperature, temperature in the reactor, <b>wall</b> temperature, preheater <b>coil</b> temperature and flue gas analysis. During this quarter a sample of the Herrin No. 6 coal (IBCSP 112) was delivered to the CANMET facility and testing is scheduled for the week of 11 December 1994. Also at this time, all of the IBCSP samples are being evaluated for blast furnace injection using the CANMET computer model...|$|R
40|$|A {{potentially}} new use for Illinois coal is its {{use as a}} {{fuel injected}} into a blast furnace to produce molten iron {{as the first step}} in steel production. Because of its increasing cost and decreasing availability, metallurgical coke is now being replaced by coal injected at the tuyere area of the furnace where the blast air enters.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Cantón et al in the April 2005 issue of the AJNR reporting on intra-aneurysmal pressure changes during HydroCoil embolization. The authors studied the intra-aneurysmal pressure after using hydrogel-coated coils. The intra-aneurysmal pressure was measured by using a standard pressure microprobe placed in a silicone model of a basilar tip aneurysm subjected to pulsatile flow. Once hydrogel-coated coils are placed within a liquid substance, they tend to swell, similar to the behavior of polymers in a diaper material. Thus, hydrogel-coils depending {{on the number of}} cross-links within the polymer and the amount of coils used will incorporate or replace most of the blood within the aneurysm sac. In trying to address some important biomechanical aspects with the use of HydroCoils, the authors were interested to study fluid pressure changes related to coiling. Of greater interest is to understand the risk of rupture associated with coiling aneurysms. This would include rather a measurement of the wall stress. The authors briefly address this shortcoming of their study. The degree of stress to which an aneurysm wall is subjected is related to the aneurysm volume. For elastic material Laplace’s law defines the relationship between wall tension (eg, in a balloon), internal fluid pressure, and radius or volume. That is, without fluid pressure changes there will be no changes in wall tension. In an aneurysm an acute volume increase and stretching of the aneurysm wall can of course occur as a result of overpacking an aneurysm with solid material, or as in this study with the use of HydroCoils. In addition local deflection of the wall, resulting in increased wall stress, can also result directly from using a stiffer material such as a <b>coil.</b> <b>Wall</b> stress in an aneurysm can be measured, but is much more complicated than measuring the intra-aneurysmal fluid pressure. To measure the stress at the aneurysm wall, smaller probes (spring elements) have in the past been placed over the aneurysm surface. The applied force during coiling and its distribution can be monitored and plotted over the entire surface...|$|R
