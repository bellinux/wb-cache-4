25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe not to support life.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the Quebec Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, Beno√Æt Pelletier, {{expressed}} his opinion {{that it was}} [...] "not impossible that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reconsider {{the role of the}} monarch, the lieutenant governor, and the governor general... I'm not saying that the monarchy must be abolished, but it will take some thought, especially on its usefulness and relevance. Two years later, Andrew Coyne called for importing [...] "not just a King of Canada, but a Canadian King" [...] that would reside permanently in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Wingate {{was chosen}} by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to write an {{official}} history of Allied deception during the war. [...] The report, which has been described as [...] "urbane, literate and readable" [...] dealt more with the British than the Americans, but provided an excellent reference and was approved by a conference in London in June 1947. [...] Like other reports of the Allied deception strategies, the report was kept secret for many years as Wingate explained: [...] "We wanted no articles in the Reader's Digest about how the Allies had outwitted the German General Staff. It was felt <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take the Russian General Staff on." ...|$|E
60|$|Wherefore, in Galileos time, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> helped <b>to</b> proscribe, or to burn--had he been {{stubborn}} {{enough to}} warrant cremation--even the great pioneer of inductive research; although, when we had fairly recovered our composure, and bad leisurely excogitated the matter, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> conclude that the new doctrine {{was better than the}} old one, after all, at least for those who <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> unlearn.|$|R

2500|$|John Hick {{used the}} term [...] "soul-making" [...] in his theodicy Evil and the God of Love to {{describe}} the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem {{that it is not}} hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then [...] "any desire that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|As for why the {{complete}} 538 polling database {{had not been}} released publicly, Silver responded: [...] "The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again {{at the end of}} this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> re-publish their data in full".|$|E
2500|$|Her {{dramatic}} and unexpected entrance drew stares from {{the residents of}} the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, glared at her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to [...] "keep your temper." [...] Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, [...] "No sir." [...] When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, [...] "I told it just like Victoria did because she said <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." [...] Bates explained that Price had said [...] "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." [...] This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.|$|E
6000|$|... "That would {{certainly}} be immense," [...] cried the eldest Rover, enthusiastically. [...] "Why didn't we think of it before? <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> written <b>to</b> them about it." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE [sitting {{down again}} with a shrug] Oh, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be told. But what could I do? If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> refused <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go out of office.|$|R
60|$|All seemed ended, and I misdoubted that {{we would}} scarce charge again so briskly in the morning, nay, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>to</b> guard our own gates.|$|R
2500|$|Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick {{has criticized}} PS3's high {{development}} costs and inferior attach rate {{and return to}} that of Xbox 360 and Wii. He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console. In an interview with The Times Kotick stated [...] "I'm getting concerned about Sony; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they don't {{make it easy for}} me to support the platform." [...] He continued, [...] "It's expensive to develop for the console, and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better. Games generate a better return on invested capital (ROIC) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation." [...] Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed. [...] " [...] to cut the [...] price, because if they don't, the attach rates are likely to slow. If we are being realistic, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop supporting Sony." [...] Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement, notably from developer BioWare who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move, and referred to the statement as [...] "silly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June, the Anchorage Daily News {{reported}} that {{a federal grand jury}} in Washington, D.C., heard evidence in May about the expansion of Stevens's Girdwood home and other matters connecting Stevens to VECO. [...] In mid-June, FBI agents questioned several aides who work for Stevens as part of the investigation. In July, Washingtonian magazine {{reported that}} Stevens had hired [...] "Washington's most powerful and expensive lawyer", Brendan Sullivan Jr., in response to the investigation. In 2006, during wiretapped conversations with Bill Allen, shortly after the VECO offices were searched and Allen agreed to cooperate with the investigation, Stevens expressed worries over legal complications arising from the sweeping federal investigations into Alaskan politics. [...] "The worst that can happen to us is we run up a bunch of legal fees, and might lose and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay a fine, might have to serve a little time in jail. I hope to Christ it never gets to that, and I don't think it will," [...] Stevens said. On the witness stand, [...] "Allen testified that VECO staff who had worked on his own house had charged 'way too much,' leaving him uncertain how much to invoice Stevens for when he had his staff work on the senator's house ... that he would be embarrassed to bill Stevens for overpriced labor on the house, and said he concealed some of the expense." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{perhaps they}} call it luncheon," [...] said Rollo. [...] "But I'd rather stay on deck. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> eat here. Don't you think we could have it on this table?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "In any case," [...] Jocelyn Thew went on, [...] "I {{think that}} the matter had better be {{discussed}} another time, when we are alone. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make reference to things which are best not mentioned in a public place." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What {{the devil}} {{do you keep}} me here for?' thundered Dempster, 'kicking my heels like a beggarly tailor waiting for a carrier's cart? I ordered you to be here at ten. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> driven <b>to</b> Whitlow by this time.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, we can't, an' {{it looks}} as if <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay here a long while, unless they get the best of us. Nobody will think of coming to look for us for a good many hours, an' that's why I said we were in a fix." ...|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps; if he {{had only}} known how miserable it made me, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> moved <b>to</b> a {{healthier}} place; but after that one time, I never could vex him or trust myself. To hear him console me and grieve for me, was worst of all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} her," [...] he replied promptly. [...] "I once--but never mind. Just keep this to {{yourself}} for a bit, my boy.

6000|$|... "You {{can never}} do it; {{you can never}} do it.
