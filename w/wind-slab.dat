40|$|We {{present a}} lattice gas model to {{simulate}} snow transport by wind and its deposition {{on a given}} ground profile. Our approach is very well suited to a fine grained massively parallel computing. 1 Introduction Massively parallel computing offers new approaches to many scientific problems by allowing the processing of a large volume of data in an acceptable amount of time. Here, we present a numerical simulation of snow transport by wind, which is a phenomena involving many complex processes. Predicting the location of snow deposit after a wind period is a crucial question to protect roads against snow drift or control the formation of <b>wind-slab</b> (responsible for about 80 % of accidently caused avalanches). Placing snow fences at appropriate locations can substantially modify {{the shape of the}} deposit, by screening out the wind. Snow fences are also used to store snow on some ski trails. Thus, a reliable simulation technique of snow transport has a large impact in exposed areas such a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Snowpacks {{found in}} boreal and polar regions {{are the most}} {{widespread}} types of snow in the world, covering up to 14 % of the globe. In both regions, snow accumulates {{over a long period}} (6 - 7 months), transforming the landscape by the presence of a thin snowpack (â‰¤ 70 cm), affecting the local climate, ecology, and hydrology. In the case of polar snow, wind plays a crucial role in redistributing snow, and shaping the snow surface. But {{in the case of the}} taiga snow found in the forests of the boreal regions, micro-topography and vegetation are stronger drivers of snow distribution than wind. In this dissertation, I explore the mechanisms responsible for shaping the snow surfaces in windy and in calm conditions. Collecting data at the plot scale with a terrestrial lidar, I sought explanations of the features geometry visible on the snow surfaces in grain scale physical processes. Because snow is close to its fusion temperature in this environment, its behavior at the grain scale can greatly influence its bulk properties. So finding linkages between processes occurring at the grain scale and the observable features at the plot scale may be key to furthering our understanding of snow distribution. In the first study, I found that the morphology and the occurrence of the seven known types of snow bedforms are dependent on the ability for wind to erode the surface. Erodibility is directly linked to the sintering of <b>wind-slab</b> grains. For this reason, every snow dune eventually turns into sastrugi. In the second study, I studied the effects of underlying topography on the accumulation of snow in calm conditions. I found that processes such as bouncing, cohesion or interlocking of snowflakes can either enhance or inhibit the smoothing of initial bumps. In the third study, I found that plant canopies affect the deposition of snow in the boreal forest. I could differentiate up to five types of canopies for their effects on snow accumulation. Despite the complexity of the canopy structures we observed, over three years, similar accumulation patterns and reactions of canopies to snow loading were seen. I was surprised to find the presence of subnivean cavities associated to plants with a size equivalent to the average snow depth...|$|E
25|$|Any wind {{stronger}} than a light breeze {{can contribute to}} a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may {{not have time to}} adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing snow from one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded <b>wind-slabs</b> are usually difficult to identify visually.|$|R
