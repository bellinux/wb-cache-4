40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the {{requirement}} of high-rate high-precision applications, 1 Hz BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) satellite clock corrections are generated based on precise orbit products, {{and the quality of}} the generated clock products is assessed by comparing with those from the other analysis centers. The comparisons show that the root mean square (RMS) of clock errors of geostationary Earth orbits (GEO) is about 0. 63 ns, whereas those of inclined geosynchronous orbits (IGSO) and medium Earth orbits (MEO) are about 0. 2 – 0. 3 ns and 0. 1 ns, respectively. Then, the 1 Hz clock products are used for BDS precise point positioning (PPP) to retrieve seismic displacements of the 2015 Mw 7. 8 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake. The derived seismic displacements from BDS PPP are consistent with those from the Global Positioning System (GPS) PPP, with RMS of 0. 29, 0. 38, and 1. 08 cm in east, north, and vertical components, respectively. In addition, the BDS PPP solutions with different clock intervals of 1 s, 5 s, 30 s, and 300 s are processed and compared with each other. The results demonstrate that PPP with 300 <b>s</b> <b>clock</b> intervals is the worst and that with 1 <b>s</b> <b>clock</b> interval is the best. For the scenario of 5 <b>s</b> <b>clock</b> intervals, the precision of PPP solutions is almost the same to 1 s results.

40|$|Different {{types of}} GPS clock and orbit data {{provided}} by the International GPS Service (IGS) {{have been used to}} assess the accuracy of rapid orbit determination for satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) using spaceborne GPS measurements. To avoid the need for reference measurements from ground-based reference receivers, the analysis is based on an undifferenced processing of GPS code and carrier-phase measurements. Special attention is therefore given to the quality of GPS clock data that directly affect the resulting orbit determination accuracy. Interpolation of clock data from the available 15 min grid points is identified as a limiting factor in the use of IGS ultra-rapid ephemerides. Despite this restriction, a 10 cm orbit determination accuracy can be obtained with these products data as demonstrated for the GRACE-B spacecraft during selected data arcs between 2002 and 2004.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{evaluation}} of a platform {{that can be used}} for timesynchronization and indoor positioning of mobile devices. The platform uses the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) of multiple ultrasonic chirps broadcast from a network of beacons placed throughout the environment to find an initial location as well as synchronize a receiver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>clock</b> with the infrastructure. These chirps encode identification data and ranging information that can be used to compute the receiver 2 ̆ 7 s location. Once the clocks have been synchronized, the system can continue performing localization directly using Time-of-Flight (TOF) ranging as opposed to TDOA. This provides similar position accuracy with fewer beacons (for tens of minutes) until the mobile device clock drifts enough that a TDOA signal is once again required. Our hardware platform uses RF-based time synchronizationto distribute clock synchronization from a subset of infrastructure beacons connected to a GPS source. Mobile devices use a novel time synchronization technique leverages the continuously free-running audio sampling subsystem of a smartphone to synchronize with global time. Once synchronized, each device can determine an accurate proximity from as little as one beacon using TOF measurements. This significantly decreases the number of beacons required to cover an indoor space and improves performance in the face of obstructions. We show through experiments that this approach outperforms the Network Time Protocol (NTP) on smartphones by an order of magnitude, providing an average 720 μs synchronization accuracy with clock drift rates as low as 2 ppm...|$|R

40|$|The period (per) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is {{fundamentally}} {{involved in the}} generation of biological rhythms. Three classes of per mutations which alter circadian periodicity have been identified: pers mutants have circadian behavioral rhythms of 19 h instead of 24 h; per mutants have long period rhythms of 28 h; and per 0 mutants have no detectable circadian rhythms. Steps {{have been taken to}} gather more information about per 2 ̆ 7 s role in the construction or maintenance of biological clocks. By analyzing transformed Drosophila lines, the amount of per product was found to be integral to the pace of the clock. Absence of. the per product leads to arrhythmicity; more per product shortens the period length; less per product lengthens period. In addition, single amino acid changes in the per product can mimic these results. DNA sequence analysis has revealed that in per 0 flies, a single nucleotide change resulted in a translational stop codon and hence a truncated protein. A valine-to-aspartic acid change in the per 1 mutants lengthens period. Likewise the shortened period length in pers mutants is a result of a serine-to-asparagine substitution. These combined studies suggest that per 1 and pers mutants produce hypoactive and hyperactive per proteins, respectively. Using the sequence analysis of the mutants as a starting point, further amino acid changes in per were created, introduced back into the fly, and then evaluated for effects on biological rhythms. Five out of six amino acid changes near the pers mutation also gave short period lengths. These results suggest that the region near the permutation acts as a domain to restrain per function and thereby slows the clock. Further insight into the nature of per function was obtained through a cell level assay. The per mutations {{have a significant effect on}} intercellular communication in the salivary gland cells of third instar larvae. Dye transfer and electrophysiological experiments indicate that gap junction conductances varies inversely with the period of the behavioral rhythms. Such alterations in communication in the nervous system may explain how per influences biological rhythms. Lastly, a detailed localization study of the per gene products during embryogenesis shows that it is expressed in particular cells in the brain and ventral nerve cord. This information should make it possible to localize the focus of per 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>clock</b> function to specific cells...|$|R

The coating analysed contains a mixture of calcite, quartz, gypsum and weddellite. The presence of calcite and quartz {{can be explained by the}} underlying clastic fossiliferous limestone, while the most probable explanation for the origin of the gypsum is via ground water. The weddellite was likely formed from solutions derived from the reaction of calcite with oxalic acid through the intervention of surface microflora, such as algae. This article provides the first record of weddellite in any context in SA. These findings have a number of implications-one being that the oxalate mineral in the rock coating could potentially be used to conduct accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analysis and thereby refine our understanding of the rock art chronology at Ngaut Ngaut. A greater understanding of the rates of accumulation may also be useful for management purposes, as the nature of the rock coating may be contributing to long-term exfoliation. Indeed, it is argued that algal colonisation of the limestone (together with other probable microfloral activities) is likely involved in the production of a film over the porous surface, leading to salt weathering.
