Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even on one's deathbed. However, at the monk's death Gregory offered 30 Masses in his remembrance to assist his soul before the final judgment. Eventually, Pope Pelagius II ordained Gregory a deacon and solicited his help in trying to heal the schism of the Three Chapters in northern Italy. However, this schism was not healed until well after Gregory was gone.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{scenes in}} the play have also been {{identified}} as offering possible evidence of co-authorship. For example, the opening lines of Act 1, Scene 2 have been argued to show clear evidence of Nashe's hand. The scene begins with Charles proclaiming, [...] "Mars his true moving – even as in the heavens/So in the earth – to this day is not known" [...] (I.ii.1–2). Some critics believe that this statement is paraphrased in Nashe's later pamphlet Have <b>with</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Saffron-Walden (1596), which contains the line, [...] "You are as ignorant as the astronomers are in the true movings of Mars, which to this day, they never could attain to." [...] The problem with this theory however, as Michael Hattaway has pointed out, {{is that there is}} no reason as to why Nashe could not simply be paraphrasing a play he had no involvement in—a common practice in Elizabethan literature.
