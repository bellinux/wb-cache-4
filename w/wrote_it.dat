5|$|Fleming {{was better}} known as the author of a series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books he <b>wrote.</b> <b>It</b> was broadly well-received, {{although}} some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided {{to make it an}} outright drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E

[...] Eventually, Manny Benito {{was brought in to}} contribute to the song's lyrics.|$|R

He--for {{there could be no}} doubt who had <b>written</b> <b>it.</b> The flash of teeth and eyes, the military salute; she knew she oughtn't to have waved to him. He had <b>written</b> <b>it</b> there while she was swimming out. <b>Written</b> <b>it</b> and then run away. She rather liked that--just an extraordinary word on the sand, like the footprint in Robinson Crusoe.|$|R

5|$|Artist Samir Mondal {{composed}} Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held {{a workshop}} with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's. Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements. Gupte created {{the rest of}} Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook. The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, by adding a finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, {{but it is not}} certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|His work at Hartekamp led {{to another}} book, , a {{catalogue}} of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in nine months (completed in July 1737), {{but it was not}} published until 1738. It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H. Breen helped her research the story.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire {{came up with an}} entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> down as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd <b>wrote</b> <b>it,</b> nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
50|$|Rachilde {{was often}} {{flexible}} with biographical information. Her explanations of writing of Monsieur Vénus are no exception. According to Maurice Barrès, {{she wrote the}} book {{when she was still}} a virgin, not yet twenty years-old. (That would put it before 1880.) Rachilde variously reported <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> while in hysterical paralysis after Catulle Mendès rejected her amorous desires; <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> as catharsis for memories of her mother's abuse of her father; and <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> just plain to create a scandal and make a name for herself.|$|R

But <b>it</b> wasn't <b>written</b> by Hirsch. If he's a French patriot he didn't <b>write</b> <b>it,</b> because it gives {{information}} to Germany. And if he's a German spy he didn't <b>write</b> <b>it,</b> well--because it doesn't give information to Germany." ...|$|R

5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle <b>wrote,</b> <b>it</b> is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
5|$|Inquirer {{journalist}} Uriah Hunt Painter {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, {{a battle}} which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but The Inquirer went with Painter's firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn The Inquirers building down because of the report. Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the Army of the Potomac, Meade's command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army of the Potomac would be attributed to Meade.|$|E

Karl and Susan make Sunny call her parents and tell them about Zeke. Sunny tells them that her parents want her to come home. Zeke tells Sunny that he will go to South Korea with her. However, when Sunny realises how much Susan and Karl need him, she tells him to stay. On her last day, Zeke organises a picnic and a {{performance}} at Charlie's from The Black Skirts. A few days after her departure, Sunny texts Zeke and tells him not to contact her again.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|Pezuela was deposed by a military-liberal coup, and José de la Serna e Hinojosa {{became the}} new viceroy. De la Serna called San Martín to {{negotiate}} {{an end of}} hostilities. The result was the same than with Pezuela: De la Serna proposed to enact the 1812 Spanish constitution (Perú inside Spain), and San Martín demanded the independence of Peru (with an independent monarchy). The rejection of the Spanish constitution was motivated by the disproportional representation of the Americas in the Constituent Assembly that <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> Both armies agreed a temporary armistice. San Martín proposed to establish an constitutional monarchy with a European monarch, with a regency ruling in the interim. The proposal was rejected, {{on the grounds that}} they could not accept it without Ferdinand's approval.|$|E
5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
