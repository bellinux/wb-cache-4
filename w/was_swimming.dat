In the five times the event had been contested, Australia had only won a silver in the inaugural race in Rome, and a bronze medal in Tokyo in 1964. On paper, Australia's team appeared much weaker {{than those of the}} other favorites: Peter Evans was the only individual medalist in the distance, claiming bronze in the 100m breaststroke, while Neil Brooks, the freestyler, and Mark Kerry, the backstroker, had been eliminated in their respective semifinals, and Mark Tonelli <b>was</b> <b>swimming</b> as a makeshift butterflyer.|$|E

25|$|Attestations of Old Dutch {{sentences}} {{are extremely}} rare.

The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the Utrecht baptismal vow (776–800) starting with Forsachistu diobolae... ec forsacho diabolae ("Do you forsake the devil?... I forsake the devil").
