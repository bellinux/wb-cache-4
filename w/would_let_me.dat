500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs}} of their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Alois {{had made}} a {{successful}} career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event {{that gave rise to}} an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw [...] "what little progress I was making at the technical school he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> devote myself to my dream".|$|E

500|$|Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher, {{some have}} seen issues in Loup's stamina and durability. His pitches can also {{come across as}} [...] "a bit too hittable." [...] He is, however, {{especially}} effective when pitching against left-handed batters. In 2013, Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays' manager John Gibbons as [...] "not necessarily a long guy; he's more a situational, one-inning guy." [...] Despite his shortcomings, Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012, having walked only 2.6% of the batters he has faced. His consistency and endurance have made Loup the Blue Jays' most-used reliever, and he says [...] "I'm {{one of those guys}} that if my body <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> I would pitch every day." ...|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E

She supported {{the two of them}} by selling CDs at flea markets, while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian. Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's what I had to do, but my counselors told me there was no way they <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> drop out. I had too much promise." [...] She attended California State University, Long Beach, and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before going to work for her father's record label.|$|E

And in a way we still are," [...] said one classmate in 1996. Jerry Atkins stated [...] "What happened was so tragic and for many of us who lived through it, the frustration and sadness will always be there." [...] Mrs. Brown said, [...] "I trust the men who are handling the investigation into my daughter's death. I'm sure they'll find who ever did it. If he is caught, I would like to kill him.

In it of his twenty five years in police work he said [...] "It's {{a long time to}} last without becoming a cynic" [...] and:During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy.

2500|$|In retaliation, Mr. Bungle parodied the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Pontiac, Michigan on Halloween of 1999. Patton {{introduced}} each Mr. Bungle {{band member}} {{with the name}} of one of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, before covering the songs [...] "Give It Away", [...] "Around the World", [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] and [...] "Scar Tissue", with Patton deliberately using incorrect lyrics. Mr. Bungle also satirized many of the mannerisms of the band, mocking heroin injections, deceased guitarist Hillel Slovak and their on-stage antics. Kiedis responded by having them removed from the 2000 Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. He said of the festival shows “I would not have given two fucks if they played there with us. But after I heard about [...] Halloween show where they mocked us, fuck him and fuck the whole band.” Patton went on to claim that Kiedis' actions had [...] "ruined" [...] Mr. Bungle's career, while Trevor Dunn remarked [...] "It really screwed us up. It screwed up my life in a personal way." [...] When asked if he had exchanged any words with Kiedis {{over the course of the}} dispute, Patton commented in 2000 [...] "I have not had words.

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
