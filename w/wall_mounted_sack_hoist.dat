50|$|The present mill {{is built}} over four storeys and is brick built with {{weatherboard}} cladding. The east elevation has three bays with gables. There is a timber lucam (covered <b>sack</b> <b>hoist)</b> of shiplap {{construction on the}} top floor of the middle bay which oversails the road below.|$|R
500|$|The {{stone floor}} {{is where the}} two pairs of underdrift French Burr {{millstones}} are located. The stones are [...] and [...] diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an oat crusher and a flour dresser.|$|R
50|$|North Elmham Mill, {{known locally}} as Grint Mill, had two breastshot waterwheels until the early 20th century when they were {{replaced}} by two turbines. By the 1970s the milling machinery was driven by mains electricity while the turbines were used to drive a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> and two mixing machines. The mill continued to produce animal feed into the late 20th century.|$|R
50|$|St Martins Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill, {{rendered}} with cement. It had a Kentish-style cap, four single patent sails and was winded by a fantail. There was a {{stage at}} first-floor level. The windshaft is of cast iron. The Brake Wheel and Wallower survive, {{as does the}} drive to the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The mill drove three pairs of stones.|$|R

50|$|The term {{layshaft}} originates with watermill machinery. The layshaft is the gear-carrying shaft {{that links}} the wallower (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones. The term, layshaft, {{was also used}} by millwrights, in both wind- and watermills, {{to refer to a}} shaft that drove secondary machinery such as <b>sack</b> <b>hoists,</b> rather than the main milling machinery.|$|R
50|$|The second main {{ingredient}} in beer is barley malt. This {{has already been}} malted in a malthouse outside the brewery tower {{and may have been}} stored for some time since. The malted grains are lifted up the tower mechanically, by either a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> or a continuous elevator. From here they are fed into a grist mill (4th floor) which crushes the grains to open their seed coat and allow good extraction of their contents.|$|R
5000|$|Hoo Mill in Haselor, is also {{powered by}} the river between Great Alne and Alcester and is {{considered}} to be the most complete traditional water-mill in the area. It still retains an internal waterwheel, which is still operational with a complete, but disused set of corn milling machinery, including an unusual <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> system. Constructed in 1810, the mill was also used for needle pointing. The last owner generated his own hydro-electricity using a turbine.|$|R

2500|$|Bardwell Mill is a four storey tower mill. The beehive cap is winded by a fantail. When fitted, {{the four}} double Patent sails have {{a span of}} [...] and are carried on a cast iron windshaft which was cast in 1989 (the {{original}} windshaft in the mill was cast in two pieces). The brake wheel is wood, driving a cast iron wallower carried on a wooden upright shaft. The wooden great spur wheel drives two pairs of overdrift millstones. A wooden crownwheel on the upright shaft drives a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{restoration}} of the mill began in 1977. The cap frame was removed on 17 August 1979 by Messrs Lennard & Lawn, millwrights, based at Caston. The new cap was fitted on 2 August 1979. The first pair of sails were fitted on 17 May 1980 and the second pair on 26 May 1983. The tower was coated with Bellecoat Stipple, a black resin-based protective covering. Internally, new floors were fitted, and a new stage constructed around the mill. Replacement machinery was sourced from other windmills. The drive for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> came from Harpley.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} built in 1845 in Jamaica Georgian style from brick on a stone base. The roof {{overhang}} is supported by timber posts in <b>wall</b> <b>mounted</b> cast iron brackets on its northern side and by <b>wall</b> <b>mounted</b> timber brackets on its southern side. It has sash windows, solid recessed panel doors and a long zinc hip roof.|$|R
50|$|The torenmolen van Gronsveld is a five storey brick tower mill. The {{vertical}} walls up to {{the stone}} floor are 1.9 m thick and house a spiral staircase and a shaft for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The meal floor has two hearths built into the wall, either one {{of which could be}} used depending on the wind direction. The first floor served as a storage room and is supported by a vaulted roof over the entrance on the ground floor. A 3 m high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel had {{electric}} lighting along its whole length, powered by electricity from the chapel. This allowed the tunnellers {{to see what}} they were doing and signal the arrival of sentries. The entrance to the tunnel in the wine cellar was concealed by five large stones covering a small door, which left little trace of any hole. Debris was transported in <b>sacks</b> <b>hoisted</b> up the clock tower to the castle's attics. The wine cellar was regularly cleaned and redusted using dust harvested from the attic, so as to hide the reddish clay dust which was not present in the cellar ordinarily.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} tributary of the River Rother. At one time the mill had two waterwheels, each working two pairs of millstones. The 12 ft diameter overshot waterwheel, which {{was originally}} cast at Cocking Foundry for Coster's Mill, West Lavington, drives the two pairs of millstone, a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> and flour dresser. The machinery in the mill was installed in 1911. The mill was donated to the Museum in 1973 and carefully dismantled, at which time evidence was found of a previous use of the site as a Hammer mill. Re-erection and restoration of the machinery took seven years.|$|R
