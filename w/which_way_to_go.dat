5|$|Meena takes Rahul to {{her father}} and {{introduces}} him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On {{the night of the}} duel, Rahul escapes {{with the help of a}} local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.|$|E

25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> at a line junction {{there is a risk}} of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.|$|E

500|$|According to the CBS {{press release}} for Rawhide, the Universal (known then as Universal-International) film company was {{shooting}} in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and {{invited him to}} meet the director. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" [...] (193cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, [...] "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> or do anything". [...] Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 August 1989, a {{pronouncement}} {{from the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party was read {{during the opening}} 19 minutes of Vremya, the main evening news program on Soviet television. It was a sternly worded warning about growing [...] "nationalist, extremist groups" [...] which advanced [...] "anti-socialist and anti-Soviet" [...] agendas. The announcement claimed that these groups discriminated against ethnic minorities and terrorised those still loyal to Soviet ideals. Local authorities were openly criticised for their failure to stop these activists. The Baltic Way {{was referred to as}} [...] "nationalist hysteria." [...] According to the pronouncement, such developments would lead to an [...] "abyss" [...] and [...] "catastrophic" [...] consequences. The workers and peasants were called on to save the situation and defend Soviet ideals. Overall, there were mixed messages: while indirectly threatening the use of force it also placed hopes that the conflict could be solved via diplomatic means. It was interpreted that the Central Committee had not yet decided <b>which</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and had left both possibilities open. The call to pro-Soviet masses illustrated that Moscow believed it still had a significant audience in the Baltics. Sharp criticism of Baltic Communist Parties was interpreted as signalling that Moscow would attempt to replace their leadership.|$|E
