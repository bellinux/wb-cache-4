5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus <b>Washstand,</b> the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova <b>Washstand,</b> were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus <b>Washstand</b> in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold. Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the <b>washstand</b> and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus <b>Washstand</b> and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Burges's painted {{furniture}} {{can be seen}} {{in major}} museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the National Museum Wales and the Manchester Art Gallery. The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford, holds a particularly fine collection, begun with a large number of purchases from the estate of Charles and Lavinia Handley-Read, including the Narcissus <b>washstand,</b> Burges's bed and the Crocker Dressing Table. The most recent acquisition by the Bedford Museum is the Zodiac settle (1869–70), painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The Museum paid £850,000 for the settle, comprising a £480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and £180,000 from the Art Fund after the British government imposed an export ban on the work.|$|E

50|$|In 1870, the {{military}} hospital had ten beds, {{as well as}} tables, chairs, <b>washstands,</b> a dumbwaiter, and a closet. Measuring 35 x 26 ft, it was heated by coal stoves. It was expanded in the late 19th century.|$|R
5|$|The first living koala in Britain {{arrived in}} 1881, {{purchased}} by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a <b>washstand</b> fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the furniture created by de Forest, Garrett also brought a set of 19th century cherry furniture with starfish, moon, and flower (or star) motifs that included two wardrobes, several cupboards, a set of side chairs and a <b>washstand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Betjeman {{was given}} the {{remaining}} two-year lease on Victorian Gothic architect William Burges's Tower House in Holland Park upon leaseholder Mrs E.R.B. Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman felt he could not afford the financial implications of taking over the house permanently, with his potential liability for £10,000 of renovations upon the expiration of the lease. After damage from vandals, restoration began in 1966. Betjeman's lease included furniture from the house by Burges, and Betjeman gave three pieces, the Zodiac settle, the Narcissus <b>washstand,</b> and the Philosophy cabinet, to Evelyn Waugh.|$|E
60|$|The {{setting of}} that apotheosis was a ten-bed attic dormitory, {{communicating}} through doorless openings with three others. The gas flickered over the raw pine <b>washstands.</b> There was an incessant whistling of drafts, {{and outside the}} naked windows the sea beat on the Pebbleridge.|$|R
50|$|By 1849, Thomas Elliott had {{extended}} his {{business to the}} sale of bricks, tiles, chimney pieces, dairy fittings, baths, <b>washstands,</b> cattle troughs and paint. Meanwhile, John was engaged {{in a survey of}} old churches for the diocese of Chichester. He had become honorary architect to the Sussex Diocesan Association and had already participated in the rebuilding of several churches in Sussex.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 Wiegard trusted Eduard Scotland and Alfred Runge {{with the}} {{interior}} {{design of the}} ship. They designed luxury cabins where the beds would convert to sofas and the <b>washstands</b> would convert into tables. All of the metalwork was gilded; the surfaces were generally white while the wooden surfaces of violet amaranth were inlaid with agate, ivory and citron wood.|$|R
25|$|By 1825, {{the room}} {{contained}} 24 unfinished mahogany armchairs, four large unfinished mahogany sofas, eight tables made of pine, a door screen, a paper partition, a three-shelf bookshelf, a mahogany map stand, a <b>washstand</b> (with basin and ewer), and a clothes press. But {{for the most}} part, from 1818 to 1829 the East Room was unused. Occasionally it was cleared and used for dances, but usually its doors were locked and it served as storage space. Congress appropriated $6,000 to finally finish the room in 1826, although the funds were not made available until 1825. President John Quincy Adams used the money to repair the White House rather than finish the room.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{his early}} furniture, such as the Great Bookcase and the Zodiac settle, was {{designed}} for his offices at Buckingham Street and subsequently moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. [...] Others, such as the Yatman Cabinet, were created as commissions. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed and its accompanying Vita Nuova <b>washstand,</b> were specifically made for suites of rooms at the Tower House. The Narcissus <b>washstand</b> was originally made for Buckingham Street and subsequently moved to Burges's bedroom at the Tower House. John Betjeman, later Poet Laureate and a leading champion of the art and architecture of the Victorian Gothic Revival, was left the remaining lease on the Tower House, {{including some of the}} furniture, by E. R. B. Graham in 1961. He gave the <b>washstand</b> to the novelist Evelyn Waugh who made it the centrepiece of his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold, in which Pinfold is haunted by the stand.|$|E
50|$|The {{numerous}} items specifically {{made for}} travel include {{a variety of}} types of bed from four poster or tent beds to chairs that would extend for sleeping; large dining tables, dining chairs, easy chairs, sofas and couches, chests of drawers, book cabinets, <b>washstands,</b> wardrobes, shelves, desks, mirrors, lanterns and candlesticks, canteens of silver, cooking equipment, toiletry equipment and thunderboxes were all made to be portable.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1902, [...] "John M. Warner, John Kimple, Louis Mitzell, Levi Starner, Chas. S. Duncan, Charles Emory and David M. Wolf" [...] {{joined to}} start the Gettysburg Manufacturing Company. The company {{manufactured}} eight or more furniture styles (e.g., buffets, sideboards, hall racks and <b>washstands</b> mainly in oak). Following Levi Starner's 1902 death, the remaining owners purchased the company in December 1904. It had become the Gettysburg Furniture Company by 1912.|$|R
50|$|Items {{listed in}} a deed of Homestead filed by Edmondson in 1881 {{indicate}} {{the quality of}} furnishings in the home. The parlor was carpeted with a Brussels carpet, and contained a set of sofas, a Steiff piano, gilt looking glass, six cushioned chairs and two parlor rocking chairs. Upstairs, two of the bedrooms were described as the Ladies' room and the Gentlemen's room and were outfitted with beds, <b>washstands,</b> wardrobes, bureaus and carpets.|$|R
500|$|A {{shortage}} of cash {{was the principal}} reason why, in 1953, Waugh agreed to be interviewed on radio by the BBC, first in the Overseas Service's Personal Call programme {{and then in the}} Frankly Speaking series. The second of these was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 16 November 1953. Most of Waugh's friends thought that he had acquitted himself well, and he was mildly pleased with the result, writing to Nancy Mitford that [...] "they tried to make a fool of me and I don't think they entirely succeeded". Nevertheless, the broadcasts preyed on Waugh's mind; he saw hostility in the attitudes of his interlocutors, a point noted by his 13-year-old son Auberon Waugh, who later wrote that the interviews [...] "drove my father mad". His friend, the poet John Betjeman, gave him William Burges's Narcissus <b>washstand</b> but Waugh became convinced that an ornamental tap was missing from the <b>washstand,</b> and was shaken when Betjeman denied the tap had ever existed.|$|E
500|$|The {{windows of}} the stair turret {{represent}} [...] "the Storming of the Castle of Love". On the first floor are two bedrooms and an armoury. Burges's bedroom, with a theme of sea creatures, overlooks the garden. Its elaborate ceiling is segmented into panels by gilded and painted beams, studded with miniature convex mirrors set in to gilt stars. Fish and eels swim in a frieze of waves painted under the ceiling, and fish are also carved in relief on the chimneypiece. On the fire-hood, a sculpted mermaid gazes into a looking-glass, with seashells, coral, seaweed and a baby mermaid also represented. Charles Handley-Read described the frieze around the Mermaid fireplace as [...] "proto-Art Nouveau" [...] and noted [...] "the debt of international art nouveau to Victorian Gothic designers, Burges included". In this room, Burges placed two of his most personal pieces of furniture, the Red Bed, in which he died, and the Narcissus <b>washstand,</b> both of which originally came from Buckingham Street. [...] The bed is painted blood red and features a panel depicting Sleeping Beauty. The <b>washstand</b> is red and gold; its tip-up basin of marble inlaid with fishes is silver and gold.|$|E
500|$|... "The Earth and its productions" [...] is {{the theme}} of the guest room facing the street. Its ceiling is adorned with {{butterflies}} and fleurs-de-lis, and at the crossing of the main beams is a convex mirror in a gilded surround. Along the length of the beams are paintings of frogs and mice. A frieze of flowers, once painted over, has since been restored. The Golden Bed and the Vita Nuova <b>Washstand</b> designed for this room are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
50|$|Other embellishments {{included}} an electric bell system, marble bureaus and <b>washstands,</b> steam heating, and gas lighting. The gas pipes throughout the building particularly led Driskill {{to make the}} hotel as fireproof as possible, with 18-inch-thick walls between the rooms and two layers of iron between each floor. The steam boilers, kitchen, and laundry facilities were relegated to the back (north) side of the hotel to prevent their odors from permeating the hotel.|$|R

Yet at each remove we drag a lengthening chain of tables, chairs, side-boards, portraits, landscapes, bedsteads, <b>washstands,</b> stoves, kitchen utensils, and bric-a-brac after us, because, {{as my wife}} says, we cannot bear to part with them. At several times {{in our own lives}} we have accumulated stuff enough to furnish two or three house and have paid a pretty stiff house-rent in the form of storage for the overflow. Why, I am doing that very thing now! Aren't you?" ...|$|R
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped <b>washstands.</b> Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|R
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{instance of}} a liquid-driven escapement {{was described by}} the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (fl. 3rd century) in his technical treatise Pneumatics (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a <b>washstand</b> automaton with those as employed in (water) clocks. Another early clock to use escapements was built during the 7th century in Chang'an, by Tantric monk and mathematician, Yi Xing, and government official Liang Lingzan. An astronomical instrument {{that served as a}} clock, it was discussed in a contemporary text as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Escapement, hydraulic-powered (use in clockworks): Although the {{escapement}} mechanism was first invented by the Greek Philon of Byzantium for a mechanical <b>washstand,</b> an {{escapement mechanism}} for clockworks was first {{developed by the}} Buddhist monk, court astronomer, mathematician and engineer Yi Xing (683–727) of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) for his water-powered celestial globe {{in the tradition of}} the Han dynasty polymath and inventor Zhang Heng (78–139), and could be found in later Chinese clockworks such as the clock towers developed by the military engineer Zhang Sixun (fl. late 10th century) and polymath inventor Su Song (1020–1101). Yi Xing's escapement allowed for a bell to be rung automatically every hour, and a drum beaten automatically every quarter-hour, essentially a striking clock. Unlike the modern escapement which employs a suspended oscillating pendulum resting and releasing its hooks on a small rotating gear wheel, the early Chinese escapement employed the use of gravity and hydraulics. In Su Song's clock tower, scoop containers fixed to the spokes of a vertical waterwheel (which acted like a gear wheel) would be filled one by one with siphoned water from a clepsydra tank. When the weight of the water in the scoop filled to an excess, it overcame a counterweight that in turn tripped a lever allowing the scoop to rotate on a pivot and drain its water. However, as the scoop fell, it tripped a coupling tongue that temporarily pulled down on a long vertical chain, the latter yanking down on a balancing lever which would pull upward on a small chain connected to a locking arm, the latter lifting momentarily to release the top arrested spoke before coming back down to repeat the entire process over again. It should be pointed out that the Chinese intermittently working liquid-driven escapement had [...] "only the name in common" [...] with the true mechanical escapement of medieval European mechanical clocks of the 14th century onwards, which worked instead with weights, producing continuous but discrete beats and that derived from the Greek and Roman verge mechanism (alarum) [...] device of earlier mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of automata {{originates}} in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China, Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic Egypt, attempted to build self-operating machines, some resembling animals and humans. Early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of Archytas, the artificial birds of Mozi and Lu Ban, a [...] "speaking" [...] automaton by Hero of Alexandria, a <b>washstand</b> automaton by Philo of Byzantium, and a human automaton {{described in the}} Lie Zi.|$|E
50|$|Château Laurier was {{commissioned}} by Grand Trunk Railway president Charles Melville Hays, and was constructed for $2 million, between 1909 and 1912 in tandem with Ottawa's downtown Union Station (now the Government Conference Centre) across the street. The two buildings were connected with a tunnel. When the hotel first opened, private rooms cost $2 a night; 155 of the 350 bedrooms featured a private bath while the other 104 rooms had <b>washstands</b> with hot and cold water connections. In addition dormitories and common bathrooms were available as were rooms for travelling salesmen with sample tables to display goods.|$|R
50|$|As the 18th century drew to {{its close}} {{the custom of}} using the same {{apartment}} as reception room by day and sleeping room by night produced a demand for what was called harlequin furniture pieces which were contrived a double or triple debt to pay. Thus a variety of complicated combination <b>washstands</b> and dressing tables were made, and fitted with mirrors and sometimes with writing conveniences and drawers for clothes. Thomas Sheraton developed astonishing ingenuity in devising a type of furniture which, if we may judge by {{the large number of}} examples still existing, must have become highly popular.|$|R

2500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{initially}} managed {{by a local}} tavern owner named Archibald Rhea, and was advertised as the largest in East Tennessee. [...] The three-story hotel featured 13 rooms, a bar, dining room, and ballroom, and had its own granary and stables. [...] Throughout much of the 1820s and 1830s, the hotel was managed by a local hotelier named Joseph Jackson, and developed into a popular gathering place for the city's elite. [...] Humes's children sold the hotel in 1837 to John Pickett and William Belden, who rechristened it the [...] "City Hotel." [...] During this period, each room in the hotel contained two feather beds, a table and chairs, and a <b>washstand</b> and looking glass.

2500|$|Frank P. Ramsey {{visited him}} on 17 September 1923 {{to discuss the}} Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind. He {{reported}} in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, <b>washstand,</b> a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends {{to persuade him to}} return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: [...] " [...] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity." ...|$|E

Earlier ships interiors had been designed by Johann Poppe who still designed the main rooms whilst Scotland & Runge did de luxe cabins and other rooms. The ship {{was to be the}} regular ocean liner that linked Bremen with New York City. They designed the luxury cabins where the beds would convert to sofas and the <b>washstands</b> would convert into tables. All of the metalwork was gilded and the surfaces were white with wooden surfaces of violet amaranth inlaid with agate, ivory and citron wood.|$|R
5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four <b>washstands</b> (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|R
