50|$|In the {{following}} 4 races, Massa failed to score any points, {{as most of}} his races were compromised by bad luck. In Austria, Massa had to start from the pitlane due to a front wing change following structural damage sustained in qualifying. In the race, and despite his pitlane start, Massa had climbed into the points before {{he was forced to}} retire with high brake temperatures on lap 63. At the next race, the , Massa started outside the top 10. His race was compromised even before the start, as torrential rain hit the circuit. The Williams car historically did not suit the wet weather conditions, and despite his infallible drive in those treacherous mixed conditions, Massa finished in eleventh, just outside the points. In {{the following}} race, in Hungary, Massa struggled throughout the race weekend. In the wet weather qualifying, Massa qualified a disappointing eighteenth. As the track began to dry, Massa switched to the intermediates, but aquaplaned at Turn 4 and made heavy contact with the barrier, which brought his session to an end. In the race, Massa finished in eighteenth. Massa encountered steering rack issues {{on the way to the}} grid, with the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>rack</b> being too light on one side and too heavy on the other. The Williams crew worked hard to try and fix it before the start of the race. The issue was improved to a degree that Massa was able to race the car, but he was extremely compromised.|$|E
40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of repeated exposure to stimulants, largely apomorphine (APO), on wheel running in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In these experiments, minor changes in procedure resulted in profound differences in the effects of APO on wheel running. Experiment 1 I compared changes in wheel running after repeated injections of 3. 0 mg/kg amphetamine (AMP), 5. 0 mg/kg of APO or vehicle (VEH). AMP resulted in a suppression in wheel running which become more pronounced over trials, while running in APO animals remained similar to the VEH group. Testing provided support for a conditioned suppression of wheel running rats previously treated with AMP relative to those treated with VEH. Experiments 2 to 4 {{examined the effects}} of repeated injections {{of a wide range of}} APO doses on wheel running in two different environments, a <b>wheel</b> <b>rack</b> and separate wheel cages. Results showed significant quadratic trends in Experiments 2 and 3, suggestive that low APO doses suppress running and higher doses elevate running. However, running in rats repeatedly injected with 1. 0 mg/kg APO was either suppressed or elevated, depending on the environment in which they were tested. Experiment 4 concurrently {{examined the effects of}} 1. 0 mg/kg APO in both environments and found that running on the rack was significantly higher than in the separate cages for the APO animals, but did not differ from VEH treated controls. The effect of noise on APO-induced running in the SEP cages was examined in Experiment 5 but had no effect on the wheel running...|$|E

50|$|Peugeot {{returned}} for the 2015 event with an all-new, diesel-powered, two-wheel drive contender, {{but failed to}} make an impact as X-Raid's Minis once more dominated. Al-Attiyah won the event in his second year for the team, while Coma racked up a fifth title in the bikes after the defection of long-time rival Despres to the car class and Peugeot. Peugeot did however see success in 2016 with Peterhansel behind the <b>wheel,</b> <b>racking</b> up his 6th win in the car category. The bike category saw the KTM works team rider, Australian Toby Price, take his first Dakar victor.|$|R
5000|$|In the September 1814 {{edition of}} Annals of Philosophy two {{locomotives}} with <b>rack</b> <b>wheels</b> are mentioned (probably Salamanca and Blücher), {{then there is}} mention of [...] "another steam locomotive at Newcastle, employed for a similar purpose coals, and moving along without any <b>rack</b> <b>wheel,</b> simply by its friction against the rail road". From the context this is at a different location to Blücher, so is probably Puffing Billy.|$|R
25|$|In 1811, John Blenkinsop {{patented}} a toothed <b>wheel</b> and <b>rack</b> rail system. The {{toothed wheel}} {{was driven by}} connecting rods, and meshed with a toothed rail at {{one side of the}} track. This was the first rack railway, and had a gauge of 4ft 1½ ins.|$|R

5000|$|Salamanca is {{probably}} the locomotive {{referred to in the}} September 1814 edition of Annals of Philosophy: [...] "Some time ago a steam-engine was mounted upon wheels at Leeds, and made to move along a rail road by means of a <b>rack</b> <b>wheel,</b> dragging after it a number of waggons loaded with coals." [...] The item continues to mention a rack locomotive about a mile north of Newcastle (Blücher at Killingworth) and one without a <b>rack</b> <b>wheel</b> (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam).|$|R
50|$|Because only a {{lightweight}} locomotive could work on cast iron rails without breaking them, the total load they {{were capable of}} hauling was very much limited.In 1811, John Blenkinsop patented a toothed <b>wheel</b> and <b>rack</b> rail system. The toothed wheel was driven by connecting rods, and meshed with a toothed rail at {{one side of the}} track. This was the first rack railway, and had a gauge of 4 ft 1½ ins.|$|R
50|$|The Jensen 541S is also {{notable for}} being the first British car to have seat belts fitted as {{standard}} equipment. Another first for the 541 series {{was the use of}} Dunlop disc brakes on all four <b>wheels.</b> A <b>rack</b> and pinion steering system was employed, giving the car very positive steering. Other safety equipment included a padded windscreen surround, fire extinguisher and first-aid kit. Each car was also fitted with a Motorola radio.|$|R
50|$|A special {{trim level}} called the Getz Cross {{features}} SUV design {{elements such as}} extended <b>wheel</b> arches, roof <b>rack,</b> raised suspension and larger wheels. It was offered with the 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre petrol engines, or with the 1.5-litre diesel engine.|$|R

5000|$|Promoting {{ergonomic}} {{practices at}} the factories {{can be one}} of the way to reduce ergonomic hazards among the workers. Proper storage and handling of heavy materials can play important role to reduce musculoskeletal issues. This intervention can include providing trolleys and <b>wheeled</b> multi-level <b>rack</b> to carry clothes and material (picture), reducing height difference to move materials manually, eliminating tasks requiring bending or twisting etc. This will prevent the workers to carry heavy loads manually and reduce back pains or muscle sprain.|$|R
25|$|For each {{keyboard}} digit, {{a sliding}} selector gear, {{much like that}} in the Leibniz <b>wheel,</b> engages the <b>rack</b> that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front wheels}} were {{suspended}} with double-wishbone connectors {{with coil springs}} and telescopic shock absorbers, and the back wheels on trailing arms with coil springs with and anti-roll bar. [...] The brakes, considered advanced at the time, were applied using a hydraulic linkage, with four light-alloy 200 mm brake drums. [...] The hand brake was operated mechanically and worked on the rear wheels. [...] Almost as innovative {{at the time was}} the specification of Tubeless tyres on the 13" [...] <b>wheels.</b> The <b>rack</b> and pinion steering required 3.36 between opposite locks, and the turning circle was 10.7 m.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rack and}} pinion is {{commonly}} found in the steering mechanism of cars or other <b>wheeled,</b> steered vehicles. <b>Rack</b> and pinion provides a less efficient mechanical advantage than other mechanisms such as recirculating ball, but less backlash and greater feedback, or steering [...] "feel". The mechanism may be power-assisted, usually by hydraulic or electrical means.|$|R
50|$|Two trim {{levels are}} available, the BX7 base model, {{and the upper}} range BX7 TS ('Touring Sedan'). Features {{exclusive}} to the TS model include a more upscale interior, a different grille pattern composed of several small diamonds similar to the Borgward logo, larger <b>wheels,</b> a roof <b>rack,</b> and an overall sportier exterior design. Five, six and seven-passenger seating configurations will be offered as well.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, a new {{entry-level}} model badged [...] "Panda Young" [...] {{was added to}} the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769 cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod FIAT 100 engine and producing the same 34 bhp (25 kW) as the more sophisticated 769 cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released; this was based on the standard 4x4, but came with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted <b>wheels,</b> roof <b>rack,</b> headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, [...] "Sisley" [...] badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model due to its popularity.|$|R
50|$|Although the Lincoln Navigator {{shares the}} same {{bodyshell}} as the Ford Expedition, {{giving it a}} similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles. Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no body panels with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), <b>wheels,</b> roof <b>rack,</b> lower body trim, and taillights. The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design. To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of sound deadening materials and higher-quality carpeting.|$|R
50|$|A Birdy can {{fit into}} a {{standard}} airline-legal 29-inch suitcase, but this requires the pedals, <b>wheels,</b> and rear <b>rack</b> to be removed. Some Birdy owners have had difficulty fitting both the bike and the rear rack into a standard suitcase, and recommend the larger 31-inch format. When fitted with thin racing tires and removable pedals, the bike can fit in a suitcase with less disassembly. With a larger case (designed specifically for the Birdy), no disassembly is required. A standard slipcase must be used on some trains and buses.|$|R
50|$|Auto processing, the {{customization}} {{of imported}} automobiles, is {{done at the}} terminal at a scaled-down assembly plant {{where much of the}} work is done by hand using simple tools. Quality control inspections are done, repairs are made, and accessories - such as floor mats, GPS systems, satellite radios, alloy <b>wheels</b> and roof <b>racks</b> - are installed. The facility at SBMT was operated by the Axis Group. which filed bankruptcy in 2012. Plans by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) to redevelop and expand the auto processing have been bogged down since 2014.|$|R

50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{of the outside}} and inside sets of motion could each be {{separately}} reversed by its own screw gear, while each set also had its own independent regulators, injectors and feed pumps. The locomotive had steam brakes on all coupled wheels as well as both bogies, {{the first and last}} South African steam locomotive to be equipped with braked bogies. The coupled <b>wheels</b> and the <b>rack</b> engine's crank disks had separate hand brakes and the inside and outside piston pairs had separate counter-pressure air brakes. In addition, the locomotive had a combination ejector to work the train's vacuum brakes.|$|R
25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran {{as fast as he could}} up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the <b>wheel</b> and <b>racked</b> a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|R
50|$|During World War I Alfred Angas Scott {{had made}} sidecar machine gun carriers. From these he {{developed}} a three-wheel car with two wheels in line and a third one set alongside but slightly behind the other rear wheel, all supported by a triangulated tubular steel frame. Although the layout still resembled that of a motorcycle and sidecar combination, it had <b>wheel</b> steering by <b>rack</b> and pinion. Its power was supplied by the Scott Company's own water-cooled 578 cc twin-cylinder two-stroke engine with drive transmitted through a three-speed gearbox to the offside rear wheel by shaft. There was no reverse gear. Turning was dangerous at speed.|$|R
50|$|The X class {{locomotives}} are a {{class of}} metre gauge 0-8-2T rack and pinion compound locomotives working on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India. They are used on the 20 km section between Coonoor and Mettupalayam where the gradient of the track can be as steep as 1 in 12.5. At these steep sections, the railway uses the Abt system. The X class locomotives are compound locomotives with two high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders. All cylinders are outside the locomotive's frames. The two low-pressure cylinders drive the <b>rack</b> <b>wheels.</b> These cylinders are positioned above the two main high-pressure cylinders, which drive the main wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} proved troublesome {{from the}} start. A motor failed {{and ran away}} with a car in tow, before derailing wrecking at Pius Street near St. Michael's Church. At {{least one of the}} injured passengers suffered wounds which were initially considered possibly fatal. The line had not as yet been formally accepted from the Daft and Company firm which had been involved in its construction, and engineers from that company laid the incident at failure to lower the sprocket <b>wheel</b> to the <b>rack</b> system when the motor failed. Additionally, the route's terrain made its operation fragile: Snow was known to put it out of operation.|$|R

It moves {{at the rate of}} three miles an hour, dragging after it 14 waggons, loaded each with about two tons of coals; so that in this case the expense of 14 horses is saved by the substitution of the steam-engine". The item continues to mention a locomotive without a <b>rack</b> <b>wheel</b> (probably Puffing Billy at Wylam).|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the animation of planar involute gearing. The thesis gives a theoretical basis for understanding the problems of gears. Introduction {{of the work is}} focused on the description of the geometry and mesh of uncorrected planar gears focusing on the line of action. Gradually meshing of gear pairs with external, internal and rack gearing is described. Following part describes mesh of planar <b>wheel</b> with manufacturing <b>rack,</b> thus creating teeth flanks by rolling. The next section describes the problems of interference with the root curve {{and its impact on the}} gear's teeth number. The last part deals with correction of teeth by shifting profile and its effect on meshing ratios...|$|R
50|$|The Riggenbach {{rack system}} used a ladder rack, formed of steel {{channels}} connected by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion <b>wheels</b> of the <b>rack</b> engine. The rungs of the NZASM rack track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering the rack section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to {{each end of the}} rack, supported by a spiral spring underneath. When the rack engine made contact with the hinged section and the gear wheels did not mesh with the rack correctly, the engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|R
