5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> from one bit to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that {{it was able to}} store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 âˆ’ 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1949, {{the average}} {{size of the}} design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National Research Development Corporation. In July 1949, IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company {{subsequently}} licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> {{in the design of}} its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.|$|E

50|$|The {{system used}} {{electrostatic}} storage, consisting of 36 <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> with {{a capacity of}} 1024 bits each, giving a total random access memory of 1024 words of 36 bits each. Each of the 36 <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> was five inches in diameter. A magnetic drum memory provided 16,384 words. Both the electrostatic and drum memories were directly addressable: addresses 0 through 01777 (Octal) were in electrostatic memory and 040000 through 077777 (Octal) were on the drum.|$|R
5|$|The {{project began}} with two aims: {{to prove the}} {{practicality}} of the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> an early form of computer memory based on standard cathode ray tubes (CRTs); and to construct a machine {{that could be used}} to investigate how computers might be able to assist in the solution of mathematical problems. The first of the series, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), ran its first program on 21 June 1948. As the world's first stored-program computer, the SSEM, and the Manchester Mark 1 developed from it, quickly attracted the attention of the United Kingdom government, who contracted the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti to produce a commercial version. The resulting machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, was the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> or Williams-Kilburn tube was a {{cathode ray}} tube used to {{electronically}} store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.|$|E
50|$|Fourteen 702s were built. The {{first one}} was used at IBM. Due to {{problems}} with the <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{the decision was made}} to switch to magnetic core memory instead. The fourteenth 702 was built using magnetic core memory and the others were retrofitted with magnetic core.|$|R
50|$|Historically, early {{computers}} used delay lines, <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes,</b> or rotating magnetic drums {{as primary}} storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by magnetic core memory. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in integrated circuit technology allowed semiconductor memory to become economically competitive.|$|R

25|$|The {{machine was}} not {{intended}} to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> the first random-access digital storage device. Invented by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester in 1946 and 1947, it was a cathode ray tube that used an effect called secondary emission to temporarily store electronic binary data, and was used successfully in several early computers.|$|E
25|$|The first rotating-drum {{storage device}} {{was used in}} the Birkbeck Automatic Relay Computer {{developed}} by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth in 1948. By 1954, magnetic core memory was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, including the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube.</b> It went on to dominate the field through the mid-1970s. A key feature of the American UNIVAC I system of 1951 was the implementation of a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed tape unit, for non-volatile storage. Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.|$|E
25|$|In December 1946, Stockport-born Frederic Calland Williams {{returned}} to Manchester {{to head the}} Electrical Engineering department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Williams also recruited Tom Kilburn, with whom he worked with at the Telecommunications Research Establishment during World War II. Both worked on perfecting the cathode ray tube which Kilburn worked on. They eventually {{came up with the}} <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> which allowed the storage of binary data. Consequently both worked on the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed the 'Manchester Baby' and on the 21 June 1948, the Machine was switched on. Despite its low performance by modern standards - the 'baby' only had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words - it was the first computer capable of storing data in the world and was breakthrough in the computer science world.|$|E
50|$|It had 4,096 {{words of}} memory in Magnetic-core memory (with 2.4 {{microsecond}} access time), supplemented by 12,288 words of memory using <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> (with 15 microsecond access time). The word size was 48 bits. Its average multiplication time was 180 microseconds {{and the average}} division time was 300 microseconds.|$|R
50|$|The machine used 2,300 vacuum tubes. It had 256 {{words of}} memory, using <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes,</b> with each word being 37 bits. It had only seven basic operations: add, subtract, and {{multiply}} (single precision and double precision versions); comparison, data extraction, input and output.Several years later drum memory was added.|$|R
50|$|Given {{the current}} level of funding a {{full-scale}} machine was not possible, so it was decided to build a smaller machine to test out the various components. <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> would store 256 12-bit words, with instructions using 3-bits of a word leaving 9-bits for addressing (allowing up to 512 words of memory).|$|R
500|$|The <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> was {{initially}} {{based on the}} CV1131, a commercially available [...] diameter CRT, but a smaller [...] tube, the CV1097, {{was used in the}} SSEM.|$|E
500|$|The {{machine was}} not {{intended}} to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> an early form of computer memory. Although considered [...] "small and primitive" [...] by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all the elements essential to a modern electronic computer. As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the [...] The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
500|$|By June 1948 the SSEM {{had been}} built and was working. It was [...] in length, [...] tall, and weighed almost [...] The machine {{contained}} 550valvesâ€”300diodes and 250pentodesâ€”and had a power consumption of 3500watts. The arithmetic unit was built using EF50 pentode valves, which had been widely used during wartime. The SSEM used one <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> to provide 32 by 32-bit words of random-access memory (RAM), a second to hold a 32-bit accumulator in which the intermediate results of a calculation could be stored temporarily, and a third to hold the current program instruction along with its address in memory. A fourth CRT, without the storage electronics of the other three, {{was used as the}} output device, able to display the bit pattern of any selected storage tube.|$|E
50|$|Another two {{graduate}} students, Alf Ratz and Josef Kates {{had been}} studying circuitry for some time by this point, and {{turned their attention to}} computer memory systems. Their first attempts were with a novel system based on neon tubes, but a 1949 visit by Freddie Williams led to them abandoning this work and moving to <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> instead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} machines, {{known as}} [...] "Atlas", used drum memory for main memory and featured a simple {{central processing unit}} built for integer math. The first Atlas machine was built, moved, and installed at the Army Security Agency by December 1950. A faster version using <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> and drums was delivered to the NSA in 1953.|$|R
50|$|The ORDVAC used 2178 vacuum tubes. Its {{addition}} time was 72 microseconds and the multiplication time was 732 microseconds. Its main memory consisted of 1024 words of 40 bits each, stored using <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes.</b> It {{was a rare}} asynchronous machine, meaning {{that there was no}} central clock regulating the timing of the instructions. One instruction started executing when the previous one finished.|$|R
50|$|Two {{alternatives}} to the delay line, the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> and Selectron tube, originated in 1946, both using electron beams in glass tubes as means of storage. Using cathode ray tubes, Fred Williams would invent the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube,</b> {{which would be the}} first random-access computer memory. The <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> would prove more capacious than the Selectron tube (the Selectron was limited to 256 bits, while the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> could store thousands) and less expensive. The <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> would nevertheless prove to be frustratingly sensitive to environmental disturbances.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum tube memory : A <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> used a {{cathode ray}} tube, and a Selectron tube used a large vacuum tube to store information. These primary storage devices were {{short-lived}} in the market, since <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.|$|E

50|$|When the Mark I {{started running}} in 1951, {{reliability}} was poor. The primary {{concern was the}} drum memory system, which broke down all the time. Additionally, the machine used 4,200 thermionic valves, mostly EF50 pentodes and diodes {{that had to be}} replaced constantly. The <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes,</b> used as random access memory and registers, were reliable but required constant maintenance. As soon as the system went into operation, teams started looking at solutions to these problems.|$|R
500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes,</b> each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit wordsâ€“ known as pagesâ€“ backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2Ã—32Ã—40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding.|$|R
5|$|Kilburn and Williams {{concluded}} that computers {{would be used}} more in scientific roles than pure maths, and decided {{to develop a new}} machine that would include a floating point unit. Work began in 1951, and the resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, and much faster for maths problems. Ferranti produced a version of Meg with the <b>Williams</b> <b>tubes</b> replaced by the more reliable core memory, marketed as the Ferranti Mercury.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{practical}} form of random-access {{memory was}} the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> starting in 1947. It stored data as electrically charged {{spots on the}} face of a cathode ray tube. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at the University of Manchester in England, the <b>Williams</b> <b>tube</b> provided the medium on which the first electronically stored-memory program was implemented in the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.

Although slower to access, at about 10 Âµs for a 10-bit short word, the system required virtually no maintenance, considerably more important for commercial users. 1024&times;40-bits of core were provided, backed by four drums each holding 4096&times;40-bits. Much detailed information both about the Mercury hardware and the Autocode coding system is included in a downloadable Spanish-language Autocode manual.|$|R

If a visible output was needed, a second tube connected in parallel with the storage tube, with a phosphor coating but without a pickup plate, was used as a display device.|$|R
