5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, {{and other critics}} stated that the broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the rainbow flag or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

25|$|Divers who are {{familiar}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> language such as American sign language and equivalents may find it useful underwater, but there are limitations due {{to the difficulty of}} performing some of the gestures intelligibly underwater with gloved hands and often while trying to hold something.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to sign Auslan fluently while speaking English, as the word order is different, and there is often no direct sign-to-word equivalence. However, mouthing of an English word together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> may serve to clarify when one sign may have several English equivalents. In some cases the mouth gesture that accompanies a sign may not reflect the equivalent translation in English (e.g. a sign meaning 'thick' may {{be accompanied by a}} mouthed 'fahth').|$|E
25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants {{who grow up}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she will}} still imitate the signs that they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E

25|$|Where ashes {{are placed}} on the head by smudging the {{forehead}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of the cross, many Christians choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day. The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule, and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them; but some Christian leaders, such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry, recommend it as a public profession of faith. Rev. Morgan Guyton, a Methodist pastor and leader in the Red-Letter Christian movement, encourages Christians to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom.|$|E

Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, {{as president of the}} Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.|$|E
25|$|The Aztecs {{were one}} of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} to this part of the Valley of Mexico {{after the fall of the}} Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already there, but the Aztecs were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a story about how their city was founded after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated their new home <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign,</b> an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, an early post-conquest manuscript, one of many Aztec codices, pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

500|$|Louis Dupré differentiates between {{signs and}} symbols, proposing that a sign points to {{something}} while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: {{rather than merely}} pointing someone towards another object, it {{takes the place of}} and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign.</b> Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself. A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived. Dupré differentiates between religious and aesthetic symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which [...] "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.|$|E
