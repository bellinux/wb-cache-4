50|$|The {{project was}} started in 2005 on a sourceforge.net repository. The game was {{developed}} completely 2D, but utilizing 3D hardware acceleration (OpenGL) for faster rendering. An optional non-OpenGL ultra low requirements vector <b>wireframe</b> <b>render</b> mode is available that should run on any legacy platform. Graphics are kept simple, sound is sparse. The game features only engine sounds, level lost/won sounds, and a strawberry pickup sound, while the main menu features a single soundtrack. Levels can feature their own music.|$|E

50|$|Pelczarski {{was hired}} as an editor at SoftSide {{magazine}} in 1980, but then left to start Penguin Software in 1981 to publish his optimistically-titled Complete Graphics System, which included digital imaging and 3D <b>wireframe</b> <b>rendering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Walt Disney film The Black Hole (1979, {{directed}} by Gary Nelson) used <b>wireframe</b> <b>rendering</b> {{to depict the}} titular black hole, using equipment from Disney's engineers. In the same year, the science-fiction horror film Alien, {{directed by}} Ridley Scott, also used wireframe model graphics, in this case to render the navigation monitors in the spaceship. The footage was produced by Colin Emmett at the Atlas Computer Laboratory.|$|R
50|$|Rendering is {{the final}} process of {{creating}} the actual 2D image or animation from the prepared scene. This {{can be compared to}} taking a photo or filming the scene after the setup is finished in real life. Several different, and often specialized, rendering methods have been developed. These range from the distinctly non-realistic <b>wireframe</b> <b>rendering</b> through polygon-based rendering, to more advanced techniques such as: scanline rendering, ray tracing, or radiosity. Rendering may take from fractions of a second to days for a single image/frame. In general, different methods are better suited for either photo-realistic rendering, or real-time rendering.|$|R
5000|$|From 1967 until 1985 {{several of}} the {{earliest}} computed generated image (CGI) or computer animated films were produced at the laboratory, particularly for the Open University. Most famously, the laboratory's facilities were used to produce the raster <b>wireframe</b> model <b>rendering</b> shown on the navigation monitors in the landing sequence of the 1979 Ridley Scott film Alien which won the 1979 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.|$|R
50|$|Direct3D 10.1 sets a {{few more}} image quality {{standards}} for graphics vendors, and gives developers more control over image quality. Features include finer control over anti-aliasing (both multisampling and supersampling with per sample shading and application control over sample position) and more flexibilities {{to some of the}} existing features (cubemap arrays and independent blending modes). Direct3D 10.1 level hardware must support the following features: Multisampling has been enhanced to generalize coverage based transparency and make multisampling work more effectively with multi-pass rendering, better culling behavior - Zero-area faces are automatically culled; this affects <b>wireframe</b> <b>rendering</b> only, independent blend modes per render target, new sample-frequency pixel shader execution with primitive rasterization, increased pipeline stage bandwidth, both colour and depth/stencil MSAA surfaces can now be used with CopyResource as either a source or destination, MultisampleEnable only affects line rasterization (points and triangles are unaffected), and is used to choose a line drawing algorithm. This means that some multisample rasterization from Direct3D 10 are no longer supported, Texture Sampling - sample_c and sample_c_lz instructions are defined to work with both Texture2DArrays and TextureCubeArrays use the Location member (the alpha component) to specify an array index, support for TextureCubeArrays.|$|R
50|$|For simple or low-fidelity drawings, paper {{prototyping}} is {{a common}} technique. Since these sketches are just representations, annotations—adjacent notes to explain behavior—are useful. For more complex projects, <b>rendering</b> <b>wireframes</b> using computer software is popular. Some tools allow the incorporation of interactivity including Flash animation, and front-end web technologies such as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.|$|R
40|$|International audienceVisual neuroprostheses are yet {{limited and}} Simulated Prosthetic Vision (SPV) {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} potential and forthcoming functionality of these implants. SPV {{has been used to}} evaluate the minimum requirement on visual neuroprostheses characteristics to restore various functions such as reading, objects and face recognition, objects grasping, etc. Some of these studies focused on obstacle avoidance but only a few investigated orientation or navigation abilities with prosthetic vision. The resolution of current arrays of electrodes is not sufficient to allow navigation tasks without additional processing of the visual input. In this study, we simulated a low resolution array (15 x 18 electrodes, similar to a forthcoming generation of arrays) and evaluated the navigation abilities restored when visual information was processed with various computer vision algorithms to enhance the visual rendering. Three main visual rendering strategies were compared to a control rendering in a wayfinding task within an unknown environment. The control rendering corresponded to a resizing of the original image onto the electrode array size, according to the average brightness of the pixels. In the first rendering strategy, vision distance was limited to three, six or nine meters respectively. In the second strategy, the rendering was not based on the brightness of the image pixels, but on the distance between the user and the elements in the field of view. In the last rendering strategy, only the edges of the environments were displayed, similar to a <b>wireframe</b> <b>rendering.</b> All the tested renderings, except the 3 m limitation of the field of view, improved navigation performance and decreased cognitive load. Interestingly, the distance-based and wireframe renderings also improved the cognitive mapping of the unknown environment. These results show that low resolution implants are usable for wayfinding if specific computer vision algorithms are used to select and display appropriate information regarding the environment...|$|R

Yielding images of a GSR model requires mesh generation of its components, inspection of their 3 D - <b>wireframe</b> model and <b>rendering</b> of the latter from a set of selected viewpoints established at inspection. The user may choose the way the GSR will appear when rendered...|$|R

Hierarchical voxel meshes are reconstructed from ltered segmented muscle images followed by FEM simulation and volume rendering. Physiological muscle force is considered and linear elastic muscle models for both static and dynamic cases are simulated by FEM. Voxel-based <b>wireframe,</b> polygon surface <b>rendering</b> and volume rendering techniques {{are applied to}} show real-time muscle deformation processes as well as realistic animations...|$|R
40|$|An {{interactive}} {{vector capability}} to create geometry and a raster color shaded rendering capability to sample and verify interim geometric design steps through color snapshots is described. The development is outlined {{of the underlying}} methodology which facilitates computer aided engineering and design. At present, raster systems cannot match the interactivity and line-drawing capability of refresh vector systems. Consequently, an intermediate step in mechanical design is used to create objects interactively on the vector display and then scan convert the <b>wireframe</b> model to <b>render</b> it as a color shaded object on a raster display. Several algorithms are presented for rendering such objects. Superquadric solid primitive extend the class of primitives normally used in solid modelers...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of Synthetic Vision System (SVS) and Enhanced Vision System (EVS) depictions of terrain features on pilot performance when displayed in an advanced head-up display (HUD) during various phases of a landing approach under instrument meteorological conditions (IMCs). SVS is a display system that presents terrain features using a <b>wireframe</b> grid <b>rendered</b> polygons by integrating terrain databases with a global positioning system. EVS displays present an actual out-of-cockpit view using a forward looking infrared camera. In the experiment as part of this study, video stimuli presenting varied HUD configurations were pre-recorded using a high-fidelity flight simulator at NASA Langley and presented to eight pilots later in a lab environment. The HUD videos from the high-fidelity simulator were combined with out-of-cockpit views from a lab simulator. The flight scenario consisted of an approach and landing on a runway (Reno, Nevada International Airport (KRNO), 16 R (right)) under IMC. Each pilot completed eight trials based on a within-subjects experimental design and one additional trial to collect verbal protocols on specific display feature use. The independent variables included four displa...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{shapes that}} are made from wires and solids with large number of holes is an {{interesting}} research problem in computer graphics. These shapes are common in art, such as Escher’s drawings of rind shapes, and the intricate nested carved sculptures of the Far East. Figure 1 is such {{an example of the}} highly decorative architectural embelishments used widely in Indian architecture. Note that this door is made from stone and has a visible thickness. Figure 1 : An example of a solid shape with large number of holes. Figure 2 : Wired caricature of Humphrey Bogart. Unfortunately, most existing modeling programs do not allow the users to easily create such beautiful structures, which we simply call wired shapes. Many modeling programs allow to <b>render</b> <b>wireframes</b> {{that can be used to}} give an illusion of wires, but wireframes are not 3 d meshes henc...|$|R
40|$|Synthesizing {{the image}} of a 3 -D scene as it would be {{captured}} by a camera from an arbitrary viewpoint is a central problem in Computer Graphics. Given a complete 3 -D model, it is possible to render the scene from any viewpoint. The construction of models is a tedious task. Here, we propose to bypass the model construction phase altogether, and to generate images of a 3 -D scene from any novel viewpoint from prestored images. Unlike methods presented so far, we propose to completely avoid inferring and reasoning in 3 -D by using projective invariants. These invariants are derived from corresponding points in the prestored images. The correspondences between features are established off-line in a semi-automated way. It is then possible to generate wireframe animation in real time on a standard computing platform. Well understood texture mapping methods {{can be applied to the}} <b>wireframes</b> to realistically <b>render</b> new images from the prestored ones. The method proposed here should allow the integration of computer generated and real imagery for applications such as walkthroughs in realistic virtual environments. We illustrate our approach on synthetic and real indoor and outdoor images...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} graphics processing requires many complex algebraic and matrix based {{operations to}} be performed in real-time. In early stages of graphics processing, such tasks were delegated to a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Over time as more complex graphics rendering was demanded, CPU solutions became inadequate. To meet this demand, custom hardware solutions that take advantage of pipelining and massive parallelism become more preferable to CPU software based solutions. This fact has lead to the many custom hardware solutions that are available today. Since real time graphics processing requires extreme high performance, hardware solutions using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are the standard within the industry. While ASICs are a more than adequate solution for implementing high performance custom hardware, the design, implementation and testing of ASIC based designs are becoming cost prohibitive due to the massive up front verification effort needed {{as well as the}} cost of fixing design defects. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide an alternative to the ASIC design flow. More importantly, in recent years FPGA technology have begun to improve in performance to the point where ASIC and FPGA performance has become comparable. In addition, FPGAs address many of the issues of the ASIC design flow. The ability to reconfigure FPGAs reduces the upfront verification effort and allows design defects to be fixed easily. This thesis demonstrates that a 3 -D graphics processor implementation on and FPGA is feasible by implementing both a two dimensional and three dimensional graphics processor prototype. By using a Xilinx Virtex 5 ML 506 FPGA development kit a fully functional <b>wireframe</b> graphics <b>rendering</b> engine is implemented using VHDL and Xilinx's development tools. A VHDL testbench was designed to verify that the graphics engine works functionally. This is followed by synthesizing the design and real hardware and developing test applications to verify functionality and performance of the design. This thesis provides the ground work for push forward the use of FPGA technology in graphics processing applications...|$|R
2500|$|With {{the launch}} of the Nintendo 3DS console in 2011, Nintendo {{released}} a handheld gaming console with autostereoscopic 3D visuals. In other words, this console produces the desired depth effects without any special glasses and is portable. In the period leading up to the release of the Nintendo 3DS, Shigeru Miyamoto discussed his view of the issues with the Virtual Boy. One was the actual use of the three-dimensional effects; while it was designed to <b>render</b> <b>wireframe</b> graphics, the effects are generally used to separate two-dimensional games into different planes separated by depth. Further, Miyamoto stated that the graphics are not as appealing, and while developing the Nintendo 64, had ruled out the use of wireframe graphics as too sparse to draw player characters. Finally, he stated that he perceived the Virtual Boy as a novelty that should not have used the Nintendo license so prominently. In a 2014 interview with IGN, Miyamoto stated that Nintendo was working on a virtual reality console based on 3DS technology. However, in February 2016, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that Nintendo was [...] "looking into" [...] virtual reality but also explained that it would take more time and effort for them to assess the technology, and in a February 2017 interview with Nikkei, he stated that the company is currently [...] "studying" [...] VR, and would add it to the Nintendo Switch once it figured out how users can play for long durations without any issues. Reggie Fils-Aimé also stated in a June 2016 interview with Bloomberg that the virtual reality market needs to become mainstream in order for Nintendo to begin major development for it.|$|R
