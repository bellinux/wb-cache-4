2500|$|In {{sociology}} and psychology, self-esteem reflects a person's overall subjective emotional evaluation {{of his or}} her own worth. It is a judgment of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself, (for example, [...] "I am competent", [...] "I am worthy"), as well as emotional states, such as , despair, pride, and shame. [...] Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying [...] "The self-concept is what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it." ...|$|E

Yet that argument in no way depends on what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phenomena--normal, supernormal, or illusory--on which the theory of ghost, soul, or spirit may have been based.

60|$|With such mixed {{feelings}} I went away. Leaving love behind is always terrible, {{but it was}} not all love that I left, and there was relief in the state of mind with which I threw myself on the sofa at Dieppe--yes, indeed. Robert felt differently from me for once, as was natural, for it had been pure joy to him with his family and his friends, and I do believe he would have been capable of never leaving England again, had such an arrangement been practicable for us on some accounts. Oh England! I love and hate it at once. Or rather, where love of country ought to be in the heart, there is the mark of the burning iron in mine, and the depth of the scar shows the depth of the root of it. Well, I am writing you an amusing letter to-day, I think. After all, I wasn't made to live in England, or I should not cough there perpetually; while no sooner do I get to Paris than the cough vanishes--it is all but gone now. The lightness of the air here makes the place tenable--so far, at least. We made many an effort to get an apartment near the Madeleine, but we had to sacrifice sun or money, or breath, in going {{up to the top of}} a house, and the sacrifice seemed too great upon consideration, and we came off to the 'Avenue des Champs-Elysées,' on the sunshiny side of the way, to a southern aspect, and pretty cheerful carpeted rooms--a drawing room, a dressing and writing room for Robert, a small dining room, two comfortable bedrooms and a third bedroom upstairs for the femme de service, kitchen, &c., for two hundred francs a month. Not too dear, <b>we</b> <b>think.</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> same that we paid, out of the season, in London for the miserable accommodation we had there. But perhaps you won't come near us now; we may be too much 'out of the way' for you. Is it so indeed? Understand that close by us is a stand of coupés and fiacres, not to profane your ears with the mention of the continual stream of omnibuses by means of which you may reach the other end of Paris for six sous. And there might be a possibility of taking a small apartment for you in this very house. See how I castle-build.|$|E
