5|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate {{as they pass}} by. <b>Wind</b> <b>waves</b> are sea surface waves that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models. As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create dunes, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the Taklamakan desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.|$|E
25|$|Seiches can be {{considered}} long period or infragravity waves, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the <b>wind</b> <b>waves,</b> having periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.|$|E
25|$|Comparison of {{the wave}} model {{forecasts}} with observations is essential for characterizing model deficiencies and identifying areas for improvement. In-situ observations are obtained from buoys, ships and oil platforms.

The bulletin came within 30 minutes of the shock, but there was no means to transmit the warning to the people on the coast that needed to know. Many of those who felt the earthquake responded by moving away from the shore, but not with any urgency.

500|$|The first {{ocean wave}} models were {{developed}} in the 1960s and 1970s. [...] These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions. [...] A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited {{the performance of the}} models. [...] After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions. [...] A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind-driven waves (also known as <b>wind</b> <b>waves)</b> caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones. [...] This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>wave</b> {{development}} {{in the presence of}} a long mechanically-generated wave was investigated in the large IRPHE <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> tank, for different wind speeds and long <b>wave</b> parameters. <b>Wind</b> and <b>wave</b> observations with and without long waves were made simultaneously at various fetches and compared. At short fetches, the <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> field observed in presence of mechanical waves exhibits a broadened dominant spectral peak shifted towards low frequencies. At large fetches, the main effect of long <b>waves</b> on <b>wind</b> <b>wave</b> fields consists in a noticeable damping of the dominant waves. The damping factor increases rapidly with long wave steepness akL at small akL but no longer varies at large akL. Moreover, this factor is strongly wind dependent, increasing first up to 6 m/s, then decreasing significantly before reaching a saturation value at high wind speeds. Consistently, the wind-generated wave fields observed in presence of long waves are characterized by much lower equilibrium dominant wave steepness. Finally, the relevant mechanisms at the origin of these phenomena and their implications for ocean wave fields are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>waves</b> also act {{to modify}} {{atmospheric}} properties through frictional drag of near-surface winds and heat fluxes. [...] Two-way coupled models allow the wave activity to feed back upon the atmosphere. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) coupled atmosphere-wave forecast system described below facilitates this through exchange of the Charnock parameter which controls the sea surface roughness. This allows the atmosphere {{to respond to}} changes in the surface roughness as the wind sea builds up or decays.|$|E
2500|$|In fluid dynamics, wind wave {{modeling}} {{describes the}} effort to depict the sea state and predict {{the evolution of the}} energy of <b>wind</b> <b>waves</b> using numerical techniques.

[...] Such wave hindcasts and wave forecasts are extremely important for commercial interests on the high seas. For example, the shipping industry requires guidance for operational planning and tactical seakeeping purposes.|$|E

Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.

2500|$|All beaches {{grow and}} shrink {{depending}} on tides, precipitation, <b>wind,</b> <b>waves</b> and current. Wet beaches tend to lose sand. Waves infiltrate dry beaches easily and deposit sandy sediment. Generally a beach is wet during falling tide, because the sea sinks {{faster than the}} beach drains. As a result, most erosion happens during falling tide. Beach drainage (beach dewatering) using Pressure Equalizing Modules (PEMs) allow the beach to drain more effectively during falling tide. Fewer hours of wet beach translate to less erosion. Permeable PEM tubes inserted vertically into the foreshore connect the different layers of groundwater. The groundwater enters the PEM tube allowing gravity to conduct it to a coarser sand layer, where it can drain more quickly. The PEM modules are placed in a row from the dune to the mean low waterline. Distance between rows is typically [...] but this is project-specific. PEM systems come in different sizes. Modules connect layers with varying hydraulic conductivity. Air/water can enter and equalize pressure.|$|E
