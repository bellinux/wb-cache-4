5|$|Aristagoras {{had been}} {{approached}} by exiled Naxian aristocrats, who <b>were</b> <b>seeking</b> {{to return to their}} island.

5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall <b>were</b> <b>seeking</b> to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New Court Argus was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E

David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera.

5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 <b>were</b> <b>seeking</b> rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{failed to}} {{recognize}} Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on December 22, 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims.

This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who <b>were</b> <b>seeking</b> independence without any ties to other countries.
