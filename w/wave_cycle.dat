5000|$|In [...] "World Peace - The Transition", Author Edward Tilley {{presents}} {{research to}} suggest that these economic booms and depressions are the natural result of climbing inequity and normal Capitalism. As opportunity wains {{near the end of}} a long <b>wave</b> <b>cycle,</b> deep recessions and depressions are created which in history have resulted in either a war or revolution in approximately 20% of cases; 80% of the time, however, depressions were ended when inequity was reset by government policy and wealth distributions. The Great Depression of 1935 for example, was ended by the California Gold Rush; an event which multiplied the gold reserves of the U.S. by 10-times. Perhaps a dozen Depressions were averted by the Hammurabi Code's Economic Control of 50-year Jubilees in history, but this tool worked within a Monarchy. In a Democracy, all voters would have to be trained to insist on and vote for these economic controls that reset inequity, or depressions must be inevitable. Tilley composed a Civics Course designed to give Grade 10 students this training as well.|$|E
