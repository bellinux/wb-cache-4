5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited <b>working</b> <b>distance).</b> The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long <b>working</b> <b>distance</b> objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aircraft {{maintenance}} inspectors spend {{many hours}} searching for defects in aircraft. Vision guidelines exist for NDI/NDT personnel, {{but not for}} visual inspectors. A detailed task analysis is required before job-relevant vision guidelines can be developed. This study is a descriptive investigation of the visual tasks of aviation visual inspectors. Methods: Visual inspectors at aircraft maintenance facilities were observed performing inspections on commercial aircraft. Various measures of the visual tasks were recorded. Results: On over 900 fixations during inspection procedures, <b>working</b> <b>distances</b> of 50 cm or less were recorded 60. 6 % of the time.
