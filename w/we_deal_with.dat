25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> this issue".|$|E
500|$|Describing Melanie as a [...] "vixen", Mowry {{believes}} that the character's imperfections allowed her to grow as an actor.

Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname [...] "Med School". VIBE Vixen's Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as [...] "bookwormy", and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as [...] "wholesome and a good student" [...] in the pilot. Heffernan called the character a [...] "kind of Cosby Show figure" [...] due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams.|$|E

[...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the chance elements to our life and that's kind of {{the embodiment of the}} feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead. He also considered directing the film, but decided against it, as he desired {{to learn more about}} producing. In 2013, Lundgren announced the casting of Tony Jaa, in the role of Tony Vitayakul; and Ekachai Uekrongtham as the director. Lundgren chose Uekrongtham after being impressed with his film, Beautiful Boxer. He contacted him through a mutual friend in Los Angeles, and in mid-2013, they arranged to meet in the city. While he had previously turned down scripts offered to him for international markets, Uekrongtham found Skin Trade [...] "riveting". He said the script [...] " [...] the potential to work as a character-driven piece while saying something about how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> scars, literal and otherwise". Jaa, on the other hand, met with Lundgren through his manager and film agent. He couldn't speak any English when cast, but claimed to have taken [...] "intensive" [...] lessons in preparation for his role; stating he is now [...] "reasonably fluent" [...] in [...] "conversational" [...] English.|$|E

500|$|After {{reading the}} first draft, Spotnitz and Carter decided to {{reintroduce}} Donnie Pfaster, a character {{from the second}} season episode [...] "Irresistible". Carter noted that, [...] "we had talked about possibly revisiting some old monster this season, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." [...] The writers and producers decided to take [...] "Orison" [...] in a [...] "substantial new direction". Although Donnie Pfaster was originally portrayed as a [...] "death fetishist", his nature was non-supernatural. In [...] "Orison", however, {{it was decided to}} make Pfaster into a true demon. Shiban explained [...] "we decided late in the process to turn him into this totally demonic character, essentially evil as an entity." [...] Spotnitz was very excited about bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, [...] "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." [...] The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act [...] "was a tough scene. Frank and I had spoken on the phone about the dialogue in the wrap-up scene with Mulder and Scully. Even though she shot him in the heightened state, you couldn't deny the fact that she killed Donnie Psaster [...] in cold blood. How do <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post {{called the}} episode [...] "deeply unsettling" [...] on purpose. She said that [...] "Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Mens {{exploration}} of the topic worthwhile and compelling {{was the fact that}} two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives. It wasn't a story about helplessness and victimization; it was an episode about everything from sweaty discomfort to outright terror, and how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> those emotions." [...] John Swansburg, writing for Slate, said the episode was a [...] "dud," [...] with the fever dream a [...] "very obvious (and not particularly enlightening) way to depict Don wrestling with his infidelity issues." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Baltimore Sun compared [...] "Mystery Date" [...] to a Stephen King novel. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times admitted that the dream sequence was [...] "heavy-handed" [...] but that [...] "there’s also something terribly convincing about the link 'Mystery Date' posits between Don’s seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and his personal demons. If only these things dissipated as easily as a fever." [...] Rolling Stone writer Sarene Leeds praised Christina Hendricks' performance and the dream sequence, asking [...] "even though it wasn't [...] "real," [...] what makes Don Draper any different from Richard Speck, the student-nurse murderer?" ...|$|E

If <b>we</b> are <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a regional problem, are we concerned with a regional estimate? The blackbird problem is chiefly a regional problem, {{but we need to}} look at broader horizons than just local or regional situations. Are <b>we</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> a national problem? Is this problem a year-round one or is it a seasonal problem? We may want to know just purely the number of birds <b>we</b> are <b>dealing</b> <b>with.</b> Another reason for doing population estimates might be to determine the effectiveness of some lethal control method that has been employed. Fortunately, those species with which we are most concerned are those not on the endangered species list at the present time. Many Ohio farmers would like to see the Red-winged Blackbird on the endangered species list, I think, but it is not there. My particular interest in population estimates is to determine if we can develop an early warning system for the agriculturists, so that they can better anticipate the time they can expect damage from birds. A lot of methods have been tried in the past...|$|R

2500|$|The Kolmogorov {{structure}} {{function of}} an individual data string expresses {{the relation between the}} complexity level constraint on a model class and the least log-cardinality of a model in the class containing the data. The structure function determines all stochastic properties of the individual data string: for every constrained model class it determines the individual best-fitting model in the class irrespective of whether the true model is in the model class considered or not. In the classical case we talk about a set of data with a probability distribution, and the properties are those of the expectations. In contrast, here <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> individual data strings and the properties of the individual string focussed on. In this setting, a property holds with certainty rather than with high probability as [...] in the classical case.

2500|$|Nor {{is there}} any reason why the state should not assist... {{individuals}} in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision.

Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like [...] Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how <b>we</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand.
