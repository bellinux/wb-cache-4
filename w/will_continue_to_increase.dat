25|$|The nominal furnace loading has {{increased}} {{during the last}} ten years and <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase.</b> Changes in air design have increased furnace temperatures. This has enabled a significant increase in hearth solids loading (HSL) with only a modest design increase in hearth heat release rate (HHRR). The average flue gas flow decreases as less water vapor is present. So the vertical flue gas velocities can be reduced even with increasing temperatures in lower furnace.|$|E

40|$|The {{speed of}} serial link I/O and optical {{communication}} systems went beyond 10 Gb/s recently and <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing.</b> While {{the advance of}} silicon technology provides the feasibility of building very-high-speed electronics, communication channel becomes the barrier {{on the way to}} further improve the data rate because of its imperfections. One of the most important limitations is due to inter-symbol interference (ISI) which is caused {{by the fact that the}} channel response are generally like a low-pass filter, instead of an all-pass filter ideally. To reduce ISI, various equalizers have been devised, and the majority of them are digital or discrete-time implementations. Despite of the existence of vast amount of DSP algorithms to achieve optimum ISI reduction, digital/discrete-time equalizers work at low data rate and consume a lot of power. Conventional continuous-time equalizers utilize active circuitries to obtain gain boosting in high frequencies, thus compensate the channel loss. However, the power consumption is significant, especially as the frequency of operation becomes higher than 10 GHz. This thesis proposes a low-power, 20 -Gb/s continuous-time adaptive passive equalizer relying on on-chip lumped RLC filter to reduce the powe...|$|R

25|$|In 2012, Brazil {{passed an}} affirmative action law {{in an attempt}} to {{directly}} fight the legacy of slavery. Through it Brazilian policy makers have forced state universities, regarded very highly because it is free and of high quality, to have a certain quota of Afro-Brazilians. The percentage of Afro-Brazilians to be admitted, as high as 30% in some states, causes great social discontent that some argue furthers racial tensions. It is argued that these high quotas are needed because of the unequal opportunities available to Afro-Brazilians. In 2012 Brazil’s Supreme Court unanimously held the law constitutional. However, in sectors like education, political representation, and overall quality of life, opportunities and capabilities for Afro-Brazilians <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase.</b> Brazil's government will continue to provide for all of its people as it sees fit, but the issue of slavery and its legacy may forever be felt in all facets of Brazilian life.|$|E

60|$|But, {{it will be}} said, as {{population}} increases, {{the price}} of food must ultimately increase also as the sources of supply in Canada, the Argentine, Australia and elsewhere {{are more and more}} used up. There must come a time, so pessimists will urge, when food becomes so dear that the ordinary wage-earner will have little surplus for expenditure upon other things. It may be admitted that this would be true in some very distant future if the population were to continue to increase without limit. If the whole surface of the world were as densely populated as London is now, it would, no doubt, require almost the whole labor of the population to produce the necessary food from the few spaces remaining for agriculture.
