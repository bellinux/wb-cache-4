5|$|In January 2005, {{during the}} {{controversy}} over his 9/11 remarks, Churchill resigned {{as chairman of the}} ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado— his term as chair was scheduled to expire in June of that year. On May 16, 2006, the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of academic misconduct, specifically plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification. On July 24, 2007, Churchill <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado's Board of Regents.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Akhmad Bassah was born, {{though he is}} thought to have been raised in Bandung, western Java, where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs. Bassah spent time working on the state-operated railroad, apparently rising to a fairly high position, but <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel. Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was {{an active member of the}} Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and helped that group in its mission of social service.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E

5|$|Oshawa's hopes in the Cup Final {{were damaged}} when Orr {{suffered}} a groin injury against Shawinigan, an injury that is painful and weakens a player's skating ability. To promote the event, held in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the Generals had advertised {{it would be}} the last chance to see Orr in junior and were anxious for him to play. Bruins' management demanded Orr not play in the Final, not wanting to risk further damage to their property. Orr and his parents, however, were adamant he be allowed to play for the national championship. As he had not signed to the Bruins, they threatened he would never play for Boston if he was held out. Blair decided to defy the Bruins' ownership and let Orr play. While Orr dressed and played some, he was not a factor and Edmonton defeated Oshawa for the Cup. Oshawa coach Bep Guidolin <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> letting Orr play, while Blair left the organization of his own accord to join the expansion Minnesota North Stars.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before a}} TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a {{physical}} scuffle with Teddy Hart {{outside of a}} restaurant that was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH show in which Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around {{the time of the}} scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> the incident. Punk, however, said the scuffle had no bearing on his TNA career. He said the reason he and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA pay-per-views was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by James Mitchell. The officials decided that since the team was not working as villains, the storyline would be put on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.|$|E

50|$|Myers sued {{in federal}} court alleging Connick {{violated}} her First Amendment rights by firing her. He maintained she had <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> refusing the transfer, but judge Jack Gordon of the Eastern District of Louisiana held that {{the distribution of the}} questionnaire was speech on a matter of public concern and thus constitutionally protected. Since the facts indicated to him that Myers had <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> <b>for</b> it, he ordered her reinstated. After the Fifth Circuit affirmed Gordon, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and narrowly reversed the ruling, holding that Myers' questionnaire largely touched on matters internal to the office that were not of public concern and thus she <b>was</b> lawfully <b>fired.</b>|$|R
