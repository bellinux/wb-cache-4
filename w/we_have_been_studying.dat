When, in the past, opinions so arguable have been enforced by State violence, it {{has been at the}} instigation of fanatics who held them for fixed and flaming certainties. If truths could not be evaded by their enemies, neither could they be altered even by their friends. But what are the certain truths that the secular arm must now lift the sword to enforce?

60|$|When we {{consider}} Dickens's life and work, {{in comparison with}} that of the two great poets <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying,</b> the contrast is startling. While Tennyson and Browning were being educated for the life of literature, and shielded most tenderly from the hardships of the world, Dickens, a poor, obscure, and suffering child, was helping to support a shiftless family by pasting labels on blacking bottles, sleeping under a counter like a homeless cat, and once a week timidly approaching the big prison where his father was confined for debt. In 1836 his Pickwick was published, and life was changed as if a magician had waved his wand over him. While the two great poets were slowly struggling for recognition, Dickens, with plenty of money and too much fame, was the acknowledged literary hero of England, the idol of immense audiences which gathered to applaud him wherever he appeared. And there is also this striking contrast between the novelist and the poets,--that while the whole tendency of the age was toward realism, away from the extremes of the romanticists and from the oddities and absurdities of the early novel writers, it was precisely by emphasizing oddities and absurdities, by making caricatures rather than characters, that Dickens first achieved his popularity.|$|E
6000|$|Various other {{gods and}} supernatural beings are {{credited}} with having created or generated the gods. Indra's {{father and mother}} are constantly spoken of, and both he and other gods are often {{said to have been}} originally mortal, and to have reached the heavens by dint of that [...] "austere fervour," [...] that magical asceticism, which could do much more than move mountains. The gods are thus by no means always credited in Aryan mythology with inherent immortality. Like most of the other deities whose history <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying,</b> they had struggles for pre-eminence with powers of a titanic character, the Asuras. [...] "Asura, 'living,' was originally an epithet of certain powers of Nature, particularly of the sky," [...] says Mr. Max Müller.** As the gods also are recognised as powers of Nature, particularly of the sky, there {{does not seem to be}} much original difference between Devas and Asuras.*** The opposition between them may be [...] "secondary," [...] as Mr. Max Müller says, but in any case it too strongly resembles the other wars in heaven of other mythologies to be quite omitted. Unluckily, the most consecutive account of the strife is to be found, not in the hymns of the Vedas, but in the collected body of mythical and other traditions called the Brahmanas.**** ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the same}} {{patience}} and heroism that had marked the long struggle for freedom, Alfred set {{himself to the}} task of educating his people. First he gave them laws, beginning with the Ten Commandments and ending with the Golden Rule, and then established courts where laws could be faithfully administered. Safe from the Danes by land, he created a navy, almost the first of the English fleets, to drive them from the coast. Then, with peace and justice established within his borders, he sent to Europe for scholars and teachers, and set them over schools that he established. Hitherto all education had been in Latin; now he set himself the task, first, of teaching every free-born Englishman to read and write his own language, and second, of translating into English the best books for their instruction. Every poor scholar was honored at his court and was speedily set to work at teaching or translating; every wanderer bringing a book or a leaf of manuscript from the pillaged monasteries of Northumbria was sure of his reward. In this way the few fragments of native Northumbrian literature, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying,</b> were saved to the world. Alfred and his scholars treasured the rare fragments and copied them in the West-Saxon dialect. With the exception of Cædmon's Hymn, we have hardly a single leaf from the great literature of Northumbria in the dialect in which it was first written.|$|E

6000|$|The {{process by}} which the god ousted the beasts may perhaps be {{observed}} in Samoa. There (as Dr. Turner tells us in his 'Samoa') each family has its own sacred animal, which it may not eat. If this law be transgressed, the malefactor is supernaturally punished in a variety of ways. But, while each family has thus its totem, four or five different families recognise, in owl, crab, lizard, and so on, incarnations of the same god, say of Tongo. If Tongo had a temple among these families, we can readily believe that images of the various beasts in which he was incarnate would be kept within the consecrated walls. Savage ideas like these, if they were ever entertained in Greece, would account for the holy animals of the different deities. But {{it is obvious that the}} phenomena which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> may be otherwise explained. It may be said that the Sminthian Apollo was only revered as the enemy and opponent of mice. St. Gertrude (whose heart was eaten by mice) has the same role in France. {119} The worship of Apollo, and the badge of the mouse, would, on this principle, be diffused by colonies from some centre of the faith. The images of mice in Apollo's temples would be nothing more than votive offerings. Thus, in the church of a Saxon town, the verger shows a silver mouse dedicated to Our Lady. 'This is the greatest of our treasures,' says the verger. 'Our town was overrun with mice till the ladies of the city offered this mouse of silver. Instantly all the mice disappeared.' 'And are you such fools as to believe that the creatures went away because a silver mouse was dedicated?' asked a Prussian officer. 'No,' replied the verger, rather neatly; 'or long ago we should have offered a silver Prussian.' ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) {{is one of}} the promising candidates for next generation field emission materials. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studied</b> emission properties of CNTs and reported that even a thick (φ ∼ 20 nm) multi-walled nanotube (MWNT) have a small emission area of about 5 × 10 − 14 cm 2, which results in brightness enhancement by 1 - 2 orders as compared with conventional tungsten field emission electron source. In this study, a single MWNT emitter is mounted on a commercially available field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) in place of a single crystalline tungsten emitter. Focused ion beam nano-machinning and nano-manipulation methods are used to prepare MWNT emitters, and practicalities of these emitters for FE-SEM use (beam alignment, beam stability, life time, image quality etc.) are investigated. As a result, it is shown that a CNT emitter has better beam stability as compared with a tungsten emitter, however, difficulties in beam alignment is still a large problem. 1...|$|R

This work evaluated the effect of ozonation on sugarcane juice in two different conditions, heated and non-heated juice. The samples in both conditions were ozonized for 120 min in a stainless-steel batch reactor, connected to an ozonation system with constant flow (17. 3 mg O 3 /min). Ozonation did not change the values of reducing sugars (RS) and the apparent sucrose content (POL); however, the color rate ICUMSA showed significant decrease for the heated juice, but there was no response to ozonation in the non-heated juice. These responses represent a key point to the industry, which during the clarification process, heats the juice before the sulfitation. The settling should become more efficient after ozonation (results not shown), showing great potential to use this technology in production systems because of the optimization of reaction parameters for color reduction ICUMSA in sugarcane juice...|$|R

The method uses two infrared light sources synchronized with the camera's frame rate. The two light sources generate bright and dark pupil images, and we can carve out {{the position of the}} pupil by subtracting them. From the series of the captured image, change of the eye gaze is measured as the displacement of the pupil's position.
