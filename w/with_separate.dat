Referred to the centrifugal test by Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute, based on proper simplification and assumption, operating mechanism and characteristics of sheet pile wharf <b>with</b> <b>separated</b> relieving platform are researched from a new angle. Besides, main influence factors are chosen for further analysis, which provides a reference for designing calculation and optimization of sheet pile wharf <b>with</b> <b>separated</b> relieving platform...|$|R

5|$|On the {{geographical}} division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> municipal bodies.

5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> archways.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center of {{learning}} in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab (school of law) were {{made available to the}} general public. Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|Also enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis. Clintonia, with a disjunct {{distribution}} involving East Asia and North America, and the {{closely related}} Medeola form a subclades {{and are now}} considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) or family (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the rbcL and matK chloroplast genes established monophyly for Clintonia, but <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APWeb) includes four of Takhtajan's families in Liliaceae, recognizing three subfamilies, {{one of which is}} divided into two tribes and referred to as Liliaceae sensu APG III.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> Anglican and Nonconformist {{sections}} and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Modernist {{hotel was}} to have started {{in the spring of}} 1970. However, {{construction}} on the , $23 million hotel and office building did not begin until June 1971.

The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co. (now Clark Construction Group).|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted <b>with</b> <b>separate</b> bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
