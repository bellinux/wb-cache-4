5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens of billions of years, {{it is likely that the}} Sun <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E

5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> out.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E

25|$|Like perfect {{competition}}, under {{monopolistic competition}} also, the firms can enter or exit freely. The firms will enter when the existing firms are making super-normal profits. With {{the entry of}} new firms, the supply would increase which would reduce the price and hence the existing firms <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> only with normal profits. Similarly, if the existing firms are sustaining losses, some of the marginal firms will exit.
