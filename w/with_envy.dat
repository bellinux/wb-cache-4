5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed <b>with</b> <b>envy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> and hostility.|$|E

25|$|Sheikh Uways' {{reputation}} and renown preceded {{him by the}} time of his arrival back in his hometown of Barawa. He was subsequently elevated as leader of the Qadiriyya in southern Somalia (which later became a sub-branch named after him, the Uwaysiyya), and began missionary works throughout East Africa. According to B.G. Martin, this newly earned prominence was met <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> by the rival brotherhoods of Ahmadiya and Saalihiya, and even by some family members, according to Samatar. This intense competition for influence led Sheikh Uways to seek greener pastures, perhaps in emulation of Muhammad's hijra from Makkah to Madinah.|$|E
25|$|Shōmu abdicated in 749 {{in favour}} of his daughter, Princess Takano-hime, then Empress Kōken. While being an {{independent}} and strong-willed woman who identified herself with the Chinese autocratic Empress Wu, during her first reign until 758 she would still be under the shadows of her father, retired Emperor Shōmu and Kōmyō. She would favour the Fujiwara and particularly Nakamaro giving him lots of revenue and power by bestowing on him titles. When Moroe publicly criticized Kōken at a drinking party in 755, Nakamaro and his followers forced him to retire. Nakamaro's rapid rise through favoritism was seen <b>with</b> <b>envy,</b> even among the Fujiwara clan members and particularly by his brother Toyonari.|$|E

2500|$|Envy is a {{theme in}} the Testament, and during his {{interrogation}} by the king, Beelzebub himself asserts that he inspires envy among humans. Among the succession of demons bound and questioned, the personification of Envy is described as headless, and motivated {{by the need to}} steal another's head: [...] "I grasp in an instant a man's head … and put it on myself." [...] As <b>with</b> <b>Envy's</b> Sisyphean efforts to replace his head, Abyzou (Obizuth) cannot rest until she steals a child each night.|$|R
25|$|However, things {{quickly turned}} sour. Although {{he watched the}} first few races of the 1995 season <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> as Jos Verstappen and Schiattarella {{demonstrated}} {{the promise of the}} new car, the truth was that his funds had taken a battering after the devastating Kobe earthquake. It contributed to Simtek's mounting financial problems, resulting in the team's closure after Monaco. Noda never even got to drive the car; he was forced to forfeit his deposit {{and the rest of his}} 1995 went up in smoke. The Forti team attempted to enter him in the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in place of Roberto Moreno, but he was denied an FIA Super Licence despite his previous experience. He was also considered for a drive at the team in , but the seat went to Luca Badoer instead.|$|E
25|$|Portland was mediocre in {{the first}} half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs {{approached}} and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49–33 win–loss record. While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game. O'Neal doubted for a while if he had made the right decision to skip college—he watched <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.|$|E

25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool <b>with</b> <b>envy.</b>|$|E

Such was the end of that business." ...|$|E

500|$|Described as a [...] "weaselly scion" [...] and a [...] "corrupt and incompetent jerk who's {{in charge}} of things but clearly {{has no idea what}} he's doing." [...] Farrell {{explained}} the motivation he gave to the character, stating [...] "This guy thinks he's God's gift to women, God's gift to intellect, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> over the relationship his father had with Kurt, and all kinds of other things. With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible." [...] Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.|$|E
500|$|English cuisine in {{the twentieth}} century {{suffered}} from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that [...] "at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [...] female writers were at the forefront of modern day cooking." [...] English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the [...] "Roast Beef of Old England" [...] lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the [...] "Gate of Calais" [...] (the other name of his painting) could only look at <b>with</b> <b>envy.</b> The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of 9.0: Live was generally positive. Reviewing for Allmusic, Johnny Loftus {{commented that the}} fans' relationship with Slipknot is [...] "what unifies the performances" [...] on the live album. He said that throughout the band's history, they have never compromised, and they had become [...] "metal stars the real way, through relentless touring, embracing fan support, and penning some truly brutal songs". Rolling Stones reviewer Christian Hoard wrote that the music featured on the album resembled a [...] "new-school Motörhead", with its [...] "scary-clown rap-metal bullshit getting steamrolled by big riffs and speed-punk beats". However, he noted the songs sounded similar to their recorded performances; Hoard called it the [...] "songs' samey-ness". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called 9.0: Live a [...] "very worthy live album", and complimented the band for gaining success the [...] "old-fashioned way, building a strong reputation as an extremely potent live act". Begrand noted the band's relationship with their [...] "extremely devoted fans" [...] as a strong point, and that the band's fans are [...] "arguably the most fervently loyal bunch {{since the early days}} of Metallica two decades ago". However, he complained that it was distracting to have the band perform in a variety of undisclosed locations, rather than the one set throughout. [...] Tom Day of musicOMH wrote that the song [...] "Before I Forget" [...] is a [...] "true gem and grinds out with a level of devastation that will make you green <b>with</b> <b>envy</b> if you weren't at these shows", and [...] that drummer Joey Jordison took [...] "centre stage" [...] throughout the performance. Blair Fischer of the Chicago Tribune gave the album [...] "three volume levels", writing, [...] "The most amazing feat is that nine genetic defectives can congeal for such synchronous brain-damaged fury". Billboard reviewer Christa Titus wrote that Slipknot was [...] "relentless in its delivery" [...] of their live performances, calling the album [...] "an overwhelming frenzy of sound and fury".
