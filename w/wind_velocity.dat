The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the <b>wind</b> <b>velocity</b> peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate <b>wind</b> <b>velocity</b> close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the time step chosen within the model {{is related to the}} {{distance}} between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The Met Office's Unified Model is run six days into the future, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10days into the future, while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog. The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast. This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model, or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts. MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance. This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and <b>wind</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Venus has {{numerous}} cloud features {{caused by}} unknown UV absorber in ultraviolet light. Horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> have been derived by tracking those features {{in order to}} examine the atmospheric circulation such as superrotation. However, the generation mechanism is not well understood yet, because the altitude of the winds is ambiguous. Ignatiev et al. (2009) performed radiative transfer calculations and showed that the cloud top altitudes in 1. 51 μm wavelength are 74 ± 1 km in low and middle latitudes and 63 - 67 km in polar region, respectively. They investigated also the correlation between the cloud top altitude in UV wavelength and that in infrared, and found that those cloud top altitudes are almost same in low and middle latitudes under the assumption of constant scale height of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a fully geometrical method using 3 images to derive cloud height and <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> simultaneously.

Average normalized radar cross-section (sigma- 0) values from all fetches follow a common trend for sigma- 0 {{as a function of}} <b>wind</b> friction <b>velocity,</b> so the fetch dependence is negligible. An empirical power-law model yields a high correlation between sigma- 0 and <b>wind</b> friction <b>velocity,</b> but, because systematic anomalies arise, we reexamine a turbulence approach that delineates low and high regimes with a transition at a <b>wind</b> friction <b>velocity</b> of approximately 25 cm/s.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{directional}} passive air sampler (DPAS) is described for collecting particulate matter (PM) in ambient air. The prototype sampler has a non-rotating circular sampling tray that is divided into covered angular channels, whose ends are open to winds from sectors covering the surrounding 360 degrees. Wind-blown PM from different directions enters relevant wind-facing channels, and is retained there in collecting pools containing various sampling media. Information on source direction and type {{can be obtained by}} examining the distribution of PM between channels. Wind tunnel tests show that external <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> are at least halved over an extended area of the collecting pools, encouraging PM to settle from the air stream. Internal and external <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> are well-correlated over an external velocity range of 2. 0 - 10. 0 m s(- 1), which suggests {{it may be possible to}} relate collected amounts of PM simply to ambient concentrations and <b>wind</b> <b>velocities.</b> Measurements of internal <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> in different channels show that velocities decrease from the upwind channel round to the downwind channel, so that the sampler effectively resolves wind directions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed on a computer-generated model of the sampler for a range of external wind velocities; the results of these analyses were consistent with those from the wind tunnel. Further wind tunnel tests were undertaken using different artificial particulates in order to assess the collection performance of the sampler in practice. These tests confirmed that the sampler can resolve the directions of sources, by collecting particulates preferentially in source-facing channels...|$|R

Because of this difficulty, some researchers have estimated meridional <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> using data obtained from a pair of ionosonde stations near the geomagnetic conjugate points, under the assumption that the meridional wind is the same at the two ionosonde stations (transequatorial mode wind). In this paper, we construct the first comparison of the estimated meridional wind velocitieswith meridional wind observed with FPIs. We analyzed data from the ionosondes and FPIs installed at Chiang Mai, Thailand, and Kototabang, Indonesia, from 2010. We found that the estimated and observed <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> were generally in good agreement on most nights, although on some nights, the <b>wind</b> <b>velocities</b> were different. The assumption that the meridional wind is equal anywhere between the two ionosonde stations would not be suitable for the days when the winds were not in good agreement.
