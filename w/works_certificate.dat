50|$|Jozef Cywinski {{was born}} in pre-war Warsaw, Poland in 1936. During World War II his family was heavily {{involved}} with the underground fighting against the Nazi. Because his family {{is part of a}} noble Polish family (using the Puchala coat of arms), the Cywinski family lost their residence and resources in Warsaw and moved to the small city of Bielsko in a mountainous region in the south of Poland. Circumstances like these were common with disastrous effects on millions of Poles. Cywinski, like many others did not receive the typical education most students would receive in school during peaceful times. In 1945, several displaced professors from Lviv and Vilnius Universities settled in Bielsko too, creating an accelerated and highly sophisticated climate in which to learn. They taught Cywinski physics, chemistry and math personally, while he attended the Liceum im. Asnyka.
