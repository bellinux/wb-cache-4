50|$|At 11:27 am and 11:29 am, {{the radar}} post at Iba Field {{detected}} two incoming raids while the closest was still 130 miles out. It alerted FEAF headquarters and the command post at Clark Field, {{a warning that}} reached only the pursuit group commander, Major Orrin L. Grover, who apparently became confused by multiple and conflicting reports. The 3rd Pursuit Squadron took off from Iba at 11:45 with instructions to intercept the western force, which was thought to have Manila as its target, but dust problems during its takeoff resulted in the fragmentation of its flights. Two flights of the 21st Pursuit Squadron (PS) at Nichols Field, six P-40Es, took off at 11:45, led by 1st Lt. William Dyess. They started for Clark but were diverted to Manila Bay as a second line of defense if the 3rd PS failed to intercept its force. The 21st's third flight, taking off five minutes later, headed toward Clark, although engine problems <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>brand-new</b> P-40Es reduced <b>its</b> numbers by two. The 17th Pursuit Squadron took off at 12:15 pm from Clark, ordered to patrol Bataan and Manila Bay, while the 34th PS at Del Carmen never received its orders to protect Clark Field and did not launch. The 20th PS, dispersed at Clark, was ready to take off but did not receive orders from group headquarters. Instead a line chief saw the incoming formation of Japanese bombers and the section commander, 1st Lt. Joseph H. Moore, ordered the scramble himself.|$|R

This approach is based on a model-driven methodology, where a tiny language is utilized to model the device features and abstract low-level complexities of a driver. The approach can handle different driver architectures. We demonstrate the genericity of the approach by applying it to a fairly mature device class that has standardized interfaces, and also to a <b>brand-new</b> <b>device</b> that has significant functionality differences.

50|$|Schlesinger {{was born}} to a Jewish family in Philadelphia. After working at a theater as an usher, songbook agent, actor, and manager (including the Palace Theater in Buffalo, New York), he founded Pacific Title & Art Studio in 1919, where most of his {{business}} was producing title cards for silent films. As talking pictures ("talkies") replaced them in 1929 and 1930, Schlesinger looked for ways {{to capitalize on the}} new technology and stay in business. Some film historians claim that he helped finance the Warner Brothers' first talkie, The Jazz Singer (1927).

5000|$|Herne was {{incorporated}} into the Robin Hood legend in the 1984 television series, Robin of Sherwood. In it, Robin of Loxley is called by Herne {{to take on the}} mantle of [...] "the Hooded Man", which Robin's father had predicted beforehand. It is Herne who encourages Loxley to become 'Robin i' the Hood' and to use his band of outlaws to fight for good against the evil Norman oppressors. Herne's appearance bears a very strong resemblance to the illustrations that previously depicted him, in that an otherwise unnamed shaman character, portrayed by actor John Abineri, dons a stag's head and tells Robin that [...] "when the horned one possesses him", he becomes the spirit of the forest. Herne featured in 17 of the 26 episodes of the series and was shown to have various magical abilities.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer and a remanufacturer. The market demands and the product returns are stochastic and are correlated with each other. The used products are converted into “as-good-as-new” products and used, together with new products, to satisfy the market demand. The remanufacturing process takes time and is subject to a random yield. Remanufactured products are pushed into the manufacturer’s inventory. It is assumed that the manufacturer exploits the order-up-to policy to determine <b>its</b> <b>brand-new</b> production quantity. We compute {{the benefit of the}} manufacturer obtaining advance notice of the product return quantities from the remanufacturer and demonstrate that the lead times, random yields and parameters describing the returns play a significant role. The interesting and counter-intuitive result is that increasing the lead time at the remanufacturer can increase the benefit. It is also shown that Bullwhip is generated even if both the demand and the return processes are a white noise process. Analytical results suggest that there is a fundamental underlying trade-off in a CLSC, which could be a barrier against the spread of CLSC...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} CFD solutions on 3 different wing-tip devices (clean tip {{referred to}} as Kuechemann-tip, tip-fence and large winglet). Work was performed {{within the framework of}} the EU-project M-DAW (Modeling and Design of Advanced Wing tip devices). Solutions on the different tip-devices will be compared with experiments at different Mach- and Reynolds numbers on - a high-speed wing/body configuration (no engines) in the ETW wind tunnel (M= 0. 85, Remac = 54 millions) and - two different low-speed configurations (cruise and take-off, with engines installed) in the DNW-KKK wind tunnel (M= 0. 2, Re-mac = 7 to 9 millions). Most solutions appear in fair agreement with the experimental data. However, specific model deformations in ETW have to be accounted for in order to improve the high-speed results. Afterwards the methods/tools used here may be taken as valid for final assessments of <b>brand-new</b> wing-tip <b>device</b> developments within the M-DAW project...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} buses make up COTA's fleet. As of June 2011 there are 308 buses in COTA's fleet, six {{of which are}} hybrid-electric buses. In June 2010 COTA {{introduced}} six new environmentally friendly buses. COTA is reducing its carbon footprint through these new hybrid buses. They feature: a 48 percent increase in fuel efficiency, a battery-powered electric motor and regenerative brakes that power the battery when pressed, an LED lighting system used {{inside and outside of}} the vehicle, and most importantly a smoother ride for passengers since the electric motors do not require shifting. Specific technologies and equipment {{have been added to the}} buses and operational facilities to help increase efficiency and safety. Due to rising gas prices, COTA is ultimately concerned with reducing fuel emissions, which sparked the addition of the hybrid-electric buses. Additional aspects added to the buses include taller mirrors with warning lights on them for safety, steering with new style steering assist to make it easier for operators and also to create more room and increased safety for larger drivers. New hardware and software was also installed in the 2011 buses and non-revenue vehicles to improve synchronization of systems through COTA and its vehicles while improving accuracy of GPS/real time information and operator communication and knowledge. COTA has also improved efficiency and safety through <b>its</b> <b>brand-new</b> paratransit facility that centralized all operators into one location.

500|$|While {{the army}} was {{studying}} a possible modernisation of <b>its</b> <b>brand-new</b> AMX-30E fleet, the Spanish Ministry of Defense had set aside 120billion pesetas (1.1billion dollars) for a future tank programme and attracted interest from five foreign companies. [...] A bid by Krauss-Maffei's, known as the Lince, provided the clearest technical designs. The tank would be [...] and equipped with a 120-millimeter main gun. It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations. Fitted with a 1,200horsepower (894.84kW) engine, the Lince could travel as fast as 70kilometers per hour (43.50mph) on the roads. [...] Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4, the Lince was smaller and lighter, trading protection for mobility. Specifically, the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain. [...] Furthermore, size restrictions were imposed due to the existing capabilities of Spain's railroad and highway network. [...] Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX-30E's thin armour, the Lince used a multi-layer armor {{similar to that of}} the German Leopard 2A4, providing greater protection than standard armour for a similar weight. The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret, again {{similar to that of the}} Leopard 2A4. [...] Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians, Spanish investment in the German-Spanish Lince programme grew up to 200billion pesetas (1.8billion dollars). However, the Spanish government did not announce any winner for the contract. This indecision led Krauss-Maffei to freeze their bid for the Lince. Krauss-Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars due to failures on part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas, who would manufacture the Lince. [...] In 1987, the Lince program was pushed aside and postponed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense's decision to instead go on with the modernisation of the Spanish Army's AMX-30E fleet. [...] Ultimately, the purchase of a number of M60 Patton tanks, the modernisation of the AMX-30E and the continued fiscal problems finally caused the Spanish Ministry of Defense to cancel the Lince programme in 1989.|$|R
