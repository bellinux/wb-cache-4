The groups of high-risk {{young women in}} this review include street-involved, justice-involved, pregnant or parenting, involved with Child Protective Services, and youth diagnosed with a mental health issue.

25|$|Current {{research}} that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances {{in two of the}} domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged {{they were more likely to}} report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction— the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.|$|E

25|$|The usual breast {{augmentation}} {{patient is}} a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body (self image), {{and a history of}} having endured criticism (teasing) about the aesthetics of her person. The studies Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients (2003) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone psychotherapy, suffered low self-esteem, presented frequent occurrences of psychological depression, had attempted suicide, and suffered body dysmorphiaa type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and {{the quality of life of}} the <b>women,</b> <b>reported</b> improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory sexual functioning. Furthermore, most of the <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> long-term satisfaction with their breast implants; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8.0 per cent of breast augmentation patients had a pre-operative history of psychiatric hospitalization.|$|E

25|$|Alexa Albert, who {{conducted}} interviews with several {{women in the}} Mustang Ranch from 1993 to 1996, reported that at one point, the brothel required all women to have pimps, who were thought to make the women work harder.

About half of the <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> having been sexually abused as children.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} sexual {{partners}} people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E

25|$|Urolagnia is an {{inclination}} to obtain sexual enjoyment {{by looking at}} or thinking of urine or urination. As a paraphilia, urine may be consumed, or the person may bathe in it.

Involuntary urination during sexual intercourse is common, but rarely acknowledged. In one survey, 24% of <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> involuntary urination during sexual intercourse; in 66% of sufferers urination occurred on penetration, while in 33% urine leakage was restricted to orgasm.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect is}} the lack of {{concordance}} between subjective sexual arousal and genital arousal. Research by Meredith L. Chivers and J. Michael Bailey indicates that men tend to show category-specific arousal; that is, they are sexually aroused by their preferred gender. However, women show category non-specificity: Their genitals show arousal to both preferred and non-preferred genders. Even though <b>women</b> <b>reported</b> being subjectively aroused to, for example, a man and woman engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex.|$|E
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined characteristics of women diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STI) {{for the first}} time in their later 20 s and early 30 s.
