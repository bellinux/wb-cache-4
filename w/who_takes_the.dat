40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was performed aiming at studying {{the effects of}} teaching cognitive and meta cognitive strategies on self-regulation learning of girl students in orphanage centers and at guidance school level. The sample included 20 girl students living in residential centers supervised by Tehran Welfare Organization; 10 of which were assigned in experimental group and 10 in control group. The standardized motivational strategies questionnaire (MSLQ), was administered as pre-test and post-test to collect data. In this process, after <b>the</b> experimental group <b>took</b> <b>the</b> pre-test, they were assigned in an 8 -session course in which they learned cognitive and meta cognitive strategies and then the post-test was administered for both experimental and control groups and their scores were compared by T-test. The results showed that: There's {{no significant difference between}} the self-regulated learning of orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and that of those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course. There's {{no significant difference between the}} test anxiety of the orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and that of those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course. There's no significant difference in applying the cognitive strategies by the orphan girl students <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and meta cognitive learning course and those <b>who</b> didn’t <b>take</b> <b>the</b> course.

5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes {{as if from a}} dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home.

Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact.|$|E
5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> soul of a dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person {{of the next generation}} dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> strange energy key from him.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight {{feet off the}} ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, and the game continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E

However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, <b>who</b> <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E
