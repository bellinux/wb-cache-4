5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified.

5|$|Match, non-friction: The {{earliest}} type {{of match}} for lighting fire {{was made in}} China by 577 AD, invented by Northern Qi (550–577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials to light fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of Northern Zhou (557–581) and the Chen Dynasty (557–589) besieged their city from outside. Early matches in China were designed to be lit by an existing flame and carried to light another fire. They were pinewood sticks impregnated with sulfur and needed only a slight touch from a flame to light.
