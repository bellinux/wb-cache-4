5|$|Olaf {{sailed to}} Norway with Orn, a sea-captain and hirdman of King Harald Greycloak. He gained great honor at Harald's court, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of the king's mother Gunnhild, who had, {{according}} to Icelandic sources, been the lover of Olaf's uncle Hrut Herjolfsson. When Olaf {{expressed a desire}} to find his mother's people in Ireland, Gunnhild financed his voyage.|$|E
5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E
5|$|Keene died {{at home on}} January 13, 2009, aged 85, from a {{respiratory}} condition. After her death, the Homer {{city council}} passed a new resolution banning the feeding of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended {{in the middle of}} winter. A memorial to Keene is planned at a nearby hotel that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> dining spot of Keene's and supplied much of her fish.|$|E

5|$|The Bulletin {{noted that}} a 2011 edition of the drink {{produced}} in Oregon was made with bacon vodka manufactured on site at the restaurant The Blacksmith. A report by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in April 2012 observed that a variety on the cocktail made by mixologist Paul Yeomans in Florida was concocted utilizing bacon salt and tomato water, infused with cucumber vodka. This version <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> selection among customers at The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida. The Food Network recommended additional ingredients including lemon juice, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, and horseradish.|$|E
5|$|The Waldorf–Astoria Orchestra {{was under}} the {{direction}} of Joseph Knecht, who was formerly assistant concertmaster of the Metropolitan Opera House. Consisting of fifty musicians, it was maintained by Boldt at an annual expense of $100,000. The orchestra performed regular Sunday night concerts in the grand ballroom. The Waldorf–Astoria Bar <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. A number of cocktails were invented at the bar, including the Rob Roy (1894) and the Bobbie Burns.|$|E
5|$|The halftime {{show of the}} 2008 Orange Bowl was headlined by American blues {{rock band}} ZZ Top, who played their song Sharp Dressed Man. The band <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing, who {{expressed}} regrets prior to the game {{that he would not}} be able to listen to the performance. Also featured during the halftime show were a group of high school marching bands, who played Stevie Ray Vaughan's Crossfire while ZZ Top's stage was disassembled. Following the halftime show, the FOX truck broadcasting the game experienced a power outage. As Fox crews worked to get the power restored, the second half was delayed by three minutes.|$|E

5|$|The series' {{popularity}} increased {{sales of}} the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained {{at the top of}} bestseller lists for months. According to The Daily Beast, Game of Thrones <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of sitcom writers and the series has been referred to in other TV series. With other fantasy series, it has been cited for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of huskies and other wolf-like dogs.|$|E
5|$|A large {{reason for}} Alabama's success passing the ball {{came from the}} {{emergence}} of freshman quarterback Andrew Zow, who assumed starting duties during the season. Zow completed 143 of 256 passes for 1,969 yards, 11 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. One of his favorite passing targets was Alexander, who caught 26 passes for 385 {{yards and four touchdowns}} in addition to his 1,178 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Alexander averaged 116 yards per game on the ground. Wide receiver Quincy Jackson was the team's leading passing target. He caught 48 passes for 621 yards four touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Michael Vaughn also <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> passing target. He caught 34 passes for 403 yards and four touchdowns in addition to performing kick-return duties during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of his great-uncle Augustus who {{for some}} time {{considered}} him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero. As a condition of Tiberius' own adoption by Augustus, Tiberius was to adopt Germanicus as a son and to name him as his heir. If Tiberius had not adopted Germanicus before his own adoption, and had Augustus adopted Tiberius first, then Tiberius would have lost sui iuris, which included the legal authority to adopt. It was a corollary to the adoption, probably the next year, that Germanicus married his maternal second cousin, Agrippina the Elder.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Louisville factory owner Alfred Victor du Pont donated $150,000 to {{the board}} of Louisville Public Schools to {{establish}} a training school to teach young men industrial arts ("manual") skills that would fit them for their duties in life. The Victorian building was built on the corner of Brook and Oak Streets by the firm of Clark and Loomis, which also designed the Speed Art Museum and Waverly Hills Sanatorium. After Manual moved out of the building it was used as a Middle School until 1974 when it was converted to apartments. Manual's first principal, Henry Kleinschmid, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of du Pont but was unpopular with the school board, which conspired to replace him in 1895. Despite a summer of controversy and protest from the du Pont family, Manual's first two graduating classes and the four major local newspapers, the board replaced him with Harry Brownell on July 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was Pomerania. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani ("Uelunzani") and Pyritzans ("Prissani") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite {{the high level of}} economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.|$|E
5|$|The first anime {{incarnation}} of Cutie Honey was broadcast from October 13, 1973 to March 30, 1974, alongside the Go Nagai Cutie Honey manga that had started publishing on October 1, 1973. Fred Patten {{wrote in the}} liner notes for Rhino Entertainment's CD The Best of Anime (1998) that the series, even untranslated, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> among early anime fan clubs for its nude transformation sequences and innuendos. Even as brief nudity became commonplace in 1980s anime, the continued popularity of Honey inspired New Cutie Honey creation in 1994. Toei Video announced the series {{in a press conference}} dated October 12, 1993, with Go Nagai, series director Yasuchika Nagaoka, Hitomi (the lead singer of the group les 5-4-3-2-1, who perform the series' Japanese theme song), and Honey and Chokkei's Japanese voice actors Neya and Matsumoto in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Wrestling in Tennessee in 1977, LeDuc {{teamed with}} Bob Armstrong {{to win the}} NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship in September. They were put over Bob Orton, Jr. and Mr. Knoxville for the belts but lost them in a rematch. While in Tennessee, LeDuc gained notoriety from a worked feud with Jerry Lawler. Wrestling as a heel, he faced Jerry Lawler, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> in the state, in many matches {{throughout}} the year. LeDuc was placed with a new partner, Jean Louie, to win the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship in May. They faced Lawler and Jimmy Valiant on May 22 to defend the belts, but the match was declared a no contest and the title was vacated. Lawler and Valiant won the belts in a rematch the following week, but LeDuc and Louie regained them the following month. In September, LeDuc and Louie dropped the belts once again, this time to Lawler and the Mongolian Stomper.|$|E
5|$|After Tillman {{returned}} from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech {{so as to}} allow Bryan to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness {{a week after the}} convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for Bryan, but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> target of cartoonists denigrating the Democratic candidate and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Bryan had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia's Thomas E. Watson. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan's behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking an arduous campaign, Bryan lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan's defeat.|$|E
5|$|After {{garrison}} duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, {{the regiment}} {{served with the}} Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations {{on the coast of}} North Carolina, and participated in the Battle of Roanoke Island and the Battle of New Bern among other engagements. Burnside's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862. The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the Army of the Potomac and participated in several of the largest battles of the Civil War, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. The most devastating engagement of the war for the 21st was the Battle of Chantilly, fought on September 1, 1862, during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties. From March 1863 to January 1864, the 21st served with Burnside in the Department of the Ohio, seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864, the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of Clara Barton, the famed battlefield nurse, who was also from Worcester County, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|In September, Alexander {{believed}} {{that he would make}} his final selection with a December verbal commitment and an April signing of his National Letter of Intent. On October 7, the Hoophall Classic schedule was announced and Curie was scheduled to play Montverde Academy on January 20. By some accounts Kansas <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> because his girlfriend was a student at Kansas and the 2013–14 Kansas Jayhawks were scheduled to play the 2013–14 Duke Blue Devils at Chicago's United Center in the ESPN Champions Classic on November 12 just before his scheduled announcement. In 2013 Caelynn Manning-Allen became a freshman on the Kansas women's basketball team. However, Illinois was very excited to be in serious contention for Alexander. It was the first time since Derrick Rose in 2006 that a top 5 prospect was still considering Illinois so late into his senior year and Alexander's level of interest seemed much higher than Rose's. Following his Illinois visit, his scheduled announcement date had moved forward to November 15. On October 31, Alexander officially eliminated Michigan State from his candidate list, leaving Kansas, Illinois, DePaul and Memphis in contention.|$|E
5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E
