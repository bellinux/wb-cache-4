5|$|Disney <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> {{whether to}} release the film in theaters or direct-to-video. The studio was {{interested}} in Matthew McConaughey as Sparrow because of his resemblance to Burt Lancaster, who had inspired that script's interpretation of the character. If they chose to release it direct-to-video, Christopher Walken or Cary Elwes would have been their first choices.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October 1959, Hordern {{made his}} debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé's comedy Moonbirds, {{alongside}} the comedian Wally Cox. The play {{was a disaster}} and closed after only two nights and three performances. Little was offered {{in the way of}} praise, although critics singled out Hordern's performance in particular as being good. He <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes of personality between cast and management.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Imogen <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 decided she would retire as artistic director after the 1977 festival. That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.|$|E

His father consulted coaches Bill Cunerty, who formerly coached at Saddleback College, and Bob Johnson, the head coach at Mission Viejo High School. Both coaches stated Mark could be a quarterback if he applied himself and was open to learning {{the intricacies of the}} position. Nick Sr. trained Mark during sessions in their backyard or at the park. Mark, who was attending Santa Margarita High School, joined the football team. During his first pass attempt as a sophomore, Mark threw a 55-yard touchdown.|$|E

After meeting with Bakshi, Crumb loaned him one of his sketchbooks as a reference, but <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> of the film's production and refused to sign the contract. Bakshi and Crumb were unable {{to reach an agreement}} after two weeks of negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb's wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney.

5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt {{it was time to move}} on and left Spineshank, although he <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E

The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012.

He <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> whether he should accept the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E

Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E

5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. They immediately telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail line. He then turned north-west.|$|E
5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel.

Nevertheless, he wanted to show the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{battle of the}} Renommée, Saint-Cricq in Clorinde had {{remained}} {{out of range of}} the British, refusing to support his commodore. When Renommée surrendered, he made all sail to the north, abandoning both Roquebert and Néréide in his attempt to escape. Although Clorinde was closely pursued by Astraea and Phoebe until 02:00 on 21 May, the damage they had suffered prevented them from gaining on the French ship and Clorinde eventually disappeared into the darkness. During the night Schomberg gathered Phoebe, Racehorse and Astraea, and rejoined Renommée at dawn on 21 May. A prize crew of seven men was sufficient to exercise control over the French frigate until Schomberg could remove most of the French crew and replace them with British sailors the following morning. Although Galatea was still within sight at dawn, Losack <b>was</b> <b>unsure</b> of the identity of the approaching squadron and decided to sail directly to Port Louis rather than risk combat with a superior enemy force.|$|E
