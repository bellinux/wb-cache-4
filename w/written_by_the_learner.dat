40|$|MEd (Natural Sciences Education), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 School science {{education}} prepares learners to study science {{at a higher}} level, prepares them to follow a career in science and to become scientific literate citizens. It {{is the responsibility of}} the educator to ensure the learners’ conceptual framework is developed to the extent that secures success at higher level studies. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of conceptual change teaching strategies on the conceptual development of grade 11 learners on Newton’s second law of motion. The two strategies employed were the cognitive conflict strategy and the development of ideas strategy. A sequential explanatory mixed-method research design was used during this study. The qualitative data were used to elucidate the quantitative findings. The quantitative research consisted of a quasi-experimental design consisting of a single-group pre-test–post-test method. During the qualitative part of the research a phenomenological research approach was utilised to gain a better understanding of participants’ learning experiences during the intervention. The quantitative research made use of an adapted version of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The data collected from the pre-test were used to inform the intervention. The intervention was videotaped and the video analysis or qualitative data analysis was done. After the intervention <b>the</b> post-test was <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> Hake’s average normalised learning gain from pre- to post-scores was analysed to establish the effectiveness of the intervention. The two sets of results (quantitative and qualitative) were integrated. Information from the qualitative data analysis was used to support and explain the quantitative data. The quantitative results indicate that there was an improvement in the students’ force conception from their initial alternative conceptions, such as that of an internal force. Especially the learners’ understanding of contact forces and Newton’s first law of motion yielded significant improvement. The qualitative data revealed that the understanding of Newton’s second law of motion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> who partook in this study did improve, since <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> immediately recognised <b>the</b> mistakes made when confronted with the anchor concept. The cognitive conflict teaching strategy was effective in establishing the anchor concept of force which proved to be useful as bridging concept in the development of ideas teaching strategy. The data from both datasets revealed that the cognitive conflict teaching strategy for the initial part of the intervention was effective. It was evident that for development of the idea teaching strategy the two data sets revealed mixed results. Recommendations were made for future research and implementation of conceptual development teaching strategies. Master...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse whether Interaction Analysis can help {{investigate}} the practice and development of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in Virtual Learning Communities (VLC). Interaction analysis is increasingly used to study learning dynamics within online activities. It proceeds by searching expressions that reveal the aspects under study in <b>the</b> <b>written</b> messages exchanged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> To this end, we devised and classified a number of indicators suggesting the existence of self-regulated events, and tested this approach on the online component of a blended course for trainee teachers.

40|$|A child {{encounters}} {{reading and}} writing spontaneously and informally already in the pre-school period. In the school period, the {{reading and writing}} skills support further learning and are therefore developed systematically throughout the curriculum (prim. Curriculum, 2011). Theoretical knowledge of beginner reading and <b>writing</b> enhanced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> motivation and stimulating learning environment help develop the child’s abilities which can be demonstrated {{in the first grade}} in the ‘Ivan Cankar’ national language competition in Slovene (hereinafter: the Cankar Award). The Cankar Award competition promotes and directs the reader to critically assess the text and express that in writing at the competition. To gain an in-depth understanding of the competition its history, a fundamental shift and developments after 2007 are presented. The question is raised for whom and for what age the competition is designed, {{about the importance of the}} reading event, how the competition is designed and how it is evaluated. Highlighted is the difference between the Cankar Award competition and the Reading badge aimed at encouraging reading. The research has focused on the question whether the more capable first grade readers and writers are able to take part at the Cankar Award competition. On a sample of 55 pupils a quantitative research approach and a test-paper were used to conduct the initial and final tests of reading and writing as well as a model of the Cankar Award competition for first graders with the evaluation criteria. The findings of the tested sample showed that the Cankar Award competition is suitable for the first grade students with advanced abilities in reading and writing. The research results could potentially affect the expansion of the competition to the more able first grade students in the rest of Slovenia. The basis for the test model of the Cankar Award competition has been prose i. e. a folk tale. The question remains open whether the competition could also be held on the model of poetry where reading and understanding are even more challenging for the first year students. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this essay is a {{comparison}} of essays <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same <b>learners</b> at two different points in time - i. e. {{while they were in}} the first and in the third grades of the Swedish secondary school. The essay includes a presentation of the raw data that have been used. The theoretical background is a general survey of some of the abundant literature relating to Second Language Acquisition and Error Analysis, and a large part of it deals with interlanguage theories. The analytical part of the work presents the results of the study, including a grammatical classification of the totality of the errors encountered as well as a presentation of the results for the whole of each class and for each individual learner. Finally, some of the theories are related to the results of the analysis and some conclusions are drawn. A part of the work consisted in the gathering of essays <b>written</b> <b>by</b> learners (exclusively with Swedish as their mother tongue) of the same class in a real school context, first to make a quantitative study of their errors, and second to make a comparison between their essays written at two different points in time. The aim was to find out if there had been an evolution, and to what extent the evolution had taken place. The hypothesis formulated {{at the beginning of this}} essay is that learners, in general, should make fewer errors after two years have passed. The results are that errors concerning Verbs (especially Concord), as well as miscellaneous spelling errors, were the most frequent ones, and this is true for both grades. As the total number of errors is lower for the third grade than for the first, and since the learners' production is larger in the third grade than in the first, the hypothesis can be considered to be true, though a larger study should be conducted to see if a general pattern can be found...|$|R
40|$|Many EFL {{learners}} find it {{challenging to}} construct their author identity in English L 2 argumentative and academic writing. Learners may present brilliant content {{by means of}} inappropriate rhetorical features and fail to communicate their message. This study focuses {{on the construction of}} author identity in English L 2 <b>writing</b> <b>by</b> Russian <b>learners.</b> <b>The</b> quantitative study investigates the overuse, underuse and misuse of first person pronouns in English L 1 and L 2 writing. Preliminary results suggest the overuse of first person pronouns and the dominance of the we perspective, since the overuse rate is the highest here. The qualitative analysis supports this finding. The pronoun we is overused in high-risk functions, whereas the pronoun I is overused in low-risk functions. To account for the overuse, the study researches the possible reasons that could cause it, including the effect of L 1 transfer, influence of speech, developmental and teaching-induced factors. All the factors, except for the influence of speech, are found {{to have an impact on}} <b>learner</b> writing. <b>The</b> final chapter presents a comparative analysis of L 2 <b>writing</b> <b>by</b> learners with Slavic backgrounds, which reveals a common tendency to overuse the we perspective.

40|$|Essay {{writing is}} a {{stepping}} stone to broaden <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> s intellect because it helps {{him or her to}} think logically, to plan, create and synthesize information which has to be clearly understood <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reader. Brown (2002 : 1) asserts that it cannot be written haphazardly without following a specific structure and consolidating its ideas with its supporting ideas so that they adhere to the chosen topic. This puts a great challenge to the Grade 10 Sepedi speaking learners who as it has been established in this research do not have the skill to write meaningful essays as evidenced by their incoherent introduction, poor word choice, wrong sentence constructions and illogical paragraphing which all result in poorly structured body paragraphs and concluding paragraphs. The study investigated the challenges which the Grade 10 Sepedi learners are facing in their essay writing and proposes ways to eliminate common errors so that learners would be able to face their educational future and corporate world with confidence. The investigation was also based on how different types of essays were taught; how essay pre-writing activities were taught to <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> educators before a full-fledged essay is written and how learners were taught to write a full-fledged essay. The significance {{of this study is that}} learners and educators will be empowered with essay writing skills which will also improve performance. An in-depth review of the literature related to essay writing skills was presented. The literature review emphasized how some authors interpreted essay writing skills. Different types of essays were unpacked for <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> and educators to make them aware of their differences and their different approaches. Different skills for essay writing were also discussed which included the spider web diagram. Duncan and Clearly (1997 : 97) concur that writing an essay has to begin with one idea and related ideas that sprout threads to other ideas, which become their own webs. The method for research included both qualitative and quantitative research. Data was collected from <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> and educators in the form of questionnaires, observations and essays which had already been <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>learners.</b> <b>The</b> data was analysed and interpreted in order to give tangible feedback and recommendations. The theoretical framework that underpins this study is based on constructivism. Constructivism is a theory based on observation and scientific study about how people learn. People construct their own understanding and knowledge of the world through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences (@ 2004 Educational Broadcasting Corporation). Data from the questionnaires, which consisted of twenty questions, proved that skills for essay writing are not taught <b>by</b> educators to <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> Data further showed that teachers do not explain the different types of essays and their approach to <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> Learners were also not taught how to implement process writing, the purpose of which, as endorsed by Murray and Johnson (1994 : 1) is the gathering of ideas, organisation of ideas, drafting, revising, and editing drafts until the final version is presented for marking. Analysis from <b>the</b> Grade 10 <b>learners</b> written essays brought to light that skills for essay writing are not used by learners during essay writing because they are not familiar with them. Important aspects such as spelling mistakes like legodu instead of lehodu and proper use of pronouns and nouns were some of the findings that needed attention. The recommendations from the findings will help the teachers to realise that skills for essay writing can be effectively and efficiently imparted to <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> educator in the teaching and learning situation in order to empower <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> in essay writing.

Aspects of the geographical environment are addressed as factors contributing to the identity of secondary school <b>learners</b> as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> themselves. In chapter two a literature study to the contribution of the geographical environment to the identity of secondary school <b>learners</b> as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> themselves was undertaken.

Aspects of the geographical environment that make a contribution to the identity of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> themselves were discussed. In chapter three the instrument of research was discussed. Questionnaires were completed by secondary school learners of different schools in the Johannesburg district of the Gauteng Department of Education. The information from the completed questionnaires helped the researcher to ascertain to what extent the aspects of the geographical environment contributed to their identities as perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> themselves. <b>The</b> analyses and interpretation of empirical data were discussed in chapter four. The validity of the research instrument was investigated.
