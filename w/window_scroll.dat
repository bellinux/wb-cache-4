Session Restore saves all open windows and tabs, width, height, and position of each <b>window,</b> <b>scroll</b> position within each scrollable area in each window, history of closed tabs and windows, cookies, text typed in forms and information to restart downloads. It is possible to recover multiple versions of this information in order to show a user’s internet activity. Other browsers also have the facility to restore a previous session...|$|E

Like the File Record, the Directory Record also stores two 16 byte fields {{for use by the}} Finder. These store things like the width & height and x & y co-ordinates for the window used to display the contents of the directory, the display mode (icon view, list view, etc.) of the window and the position of the <b>window's</b> <b>scroll</b> bar.|$|R
5000|$|In most Mac OS X applications, the key works {{differently}} than on other platforms.

50|$|Buffers are {{displayed}} in windows, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a frame in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible).

5000|$|Lancelot C. Ewbank House, {{also known}} as the Ewbank-Loudermilk House, is a {{historic}} home located in Penn Township, Parke County, Indiana.

50|$|IJKL {{is used by}} {{a growing}} number of browser games. These games cannot use the arrow keys because many browsers' <b>windows</b> will <b>scroll</b> if the arrow keys are used, thus {{hindering}} gameplay. This is a problem specific to DHTML/JavaScript games. IJKL, like WASD, are arranged in an ergonomic inverted T shape, and, since they are used by the right hand, adjustment is easy for people who commonly use the arrow keys.|$|R
50|$|Snagit is {{a screen}} capture and editing tool. It captures animation, {{graphics}} and {{text in the}} form of images or videos. The app also allows the user to enhance their images with special effects and multimedia features. Snagit allows the user to grab the entire desktop, a region, a <b>window,</b> or a <b>scrolling</b> <b>window.</b> Features include the ability to combine images, blur and magnifying effects, arrows, callouts, torn edges, etc. In terms of sharing, the final capture can be saved in various formats, a URL or embed code can be produced, or it can be added to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, MindManager, or Microsoft OneNote directly from the product interface.|$|R
5|$|Absolute, relative, {{and fixed}} CSS {{positioning}}: Absolute positioning {{means that the}} web developer specifies the exact X and Y coordinates where an element is to be placed into the page. Relative positioning means that the web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to the browser <b>window,</b> and <b>scrolls</b> with the <b>window</b> rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|R
50|$|Another {{scrolling}} technique with scrollbars {{is to look}} {{at which}} mouse button was pressed. For instance, a left-click on the down arrow might cause the <b>window</b> to <b>scroll</b> down, while a right click in the same place would scroll up (e.g. RISC OS), or the middle button could be used to place the thumb precisely. This form requires less fine motor skills, although it requires a multi-button mouse, and possibly a greater degree of GUI literacy.|$|R

5000|$|German Bank, {{also known}} as the Silver Dollar Tavern, is a {{historic}} building located in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The city's German community was its most prominent ethnic group in the mid to late 19th century. [...] Like many other cities in Iowa of that area it had banks that were owned by, and catered to, members of their particular immigrant communities. T.H. Thedinga, the city's first German-born mayor, started this bank in 1864 to serve immigrant Germans. In 1868 it moved from its original location on Main Street and into the former Dubuque Miners' Bank building. That building was torn down in 1901 in order to construct this one. It was designed by Dubuque architect John Spencer in partnership with Chicago architect W.G. Williamson. The three-story brick building has a highly decorative main facade composed of polished pink granite on the main floor and terra cotta on the upper two floors. Decorative elements include egg-and-dart, Greek fret, a row of small lions' heads, bay <b>windows,</b> <b>scroll</b> pediments, imperial German eagles, and a bracketed cornice with dentils. The second and third floors are dominated by four fluted, banded columns with Corinthian capitals.|$|R
50|$|Most GUI environments neglect , {{which means}} {{scrolling}} must be accomplished with a mouse, using means such as scrollbars or scroll wheels. Often, the middle or the wheel mouse button {{works as a}} toggle determining if mouse movements will move the mouse cursor or scroll the contents in <b>scroll</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{limestone}} stringcourse {{sets off}} the top of the story. The second-story <b>windows</b> have <b>scrolled</b> keystones as well, but over smaller, rectangular openings. They, and all the other window bays on the upper stories, are filled by eight-over-one sash windows, in the outer four bays and recessed French doors in the inner three, opening onto a balcony with wrought iron railing supported in the middle by the entrance portico and on the sides by large scrolled brackets. The brickwork echoes the rustication below and is further quoined at the corners.|$|R
50|$|The John Carney House is a {{historic}} house located at 306 E. Market St. in Troy, Illinois. The house was built in 1871 for John Carney, a local businessman, and his wife Elizabeth, who came from the locally prominent Koerner family. The Italianate house {{is one of the}} few designed in the style in Troy. The two-story house features a recessed three-story tower at the entrance. The porches at the front and rear entrances have Victorian designs with post arches and brackets. The house's design includes tall round-headed <b>windows</b> and <b>scrolled</b> brackets along the cornice.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of public-oriented {{emergency}} communications, a computer pop-up ability might prove useful for public computers or interactive kiosks where {{more than one person}} might use it, or for computers with displays that are in prominent locations. In this case, the pop-up might also need to be easily read from a distance, and be able to get attention — similar to how a digital sign may be used. These might be structured as a notification window with static non-moving text, or as a <b>window</b> with <b>scrolling</b> text.|$|R
50|$|Hannah Memorial Wesleyan Chapel, High Street, Lincoln (1875). In 1875, the Wesleyan Methodists built a large chapel on the High Street {{named after}} Thomas Hannah (but {{also known as}} ‘Little Wesley’). The architects were Bellamy and Hardy; the chapel was {{demolished}} in 1965. The chapel was built constructed from brick and ashlar in the classical style; a five bay frontage, three storeys high. Four pillars, complete with Corinthian capitals, all supporting a pediment with a central round arched <b>window</b> with <b>scrolled</b> frieze. The site is now occupied by the Thomas Cooper Memorial Baptist Church, built in 1973-74 to a design by Frederick Gibberd and Partners.|$|R

50|$|The use of helper {{applications}} {{was more}} common {{in the early days of}} the World Wide Web, when HTML and file formats were still becoming standardized and computers were less powerful. Users of a slower computer could configure their browser to hand off all images using a helper application, which would cause the browser to display a standard icon as a placeholder. The user could click the icon only for images they wished to view, thus saving time and bandwidth. In addition, it was considered important for early browsers to be able to keep an image illustrating a figure or graph on screen while scrolling through a long scientific paper and having the image displayed in an external window while the browser <b>window</b> was <b>scrolled</b> allowed that.|$|R
40|$|Scrolling {{mechanism}} {{is used to}} display and edit large documents in a limited screen space or <b>window.</b> The <b>scrolling</b> mechanism may include a vertical scroll bar or a horizontal scroll bar or both to move {{the contents of the}} documents up and down or left and right. There may be navigation buttons on the screen representing the navigation keys on the keyboard. The user can click these buttons to scroll the screen. There may be very different methods of scrolling such as by using the "thumb", as popularly used with a PDF document. Scrolling may be achieved through eyeball tracking in a hands-free environment where the user does not have hands or wants to use hands for other activities.
