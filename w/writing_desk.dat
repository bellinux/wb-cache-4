25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable <b>writing</b> <b>desk</b> and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

25|$|The {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} carrack {{in the morning}} of October 18, when most of the crew was on the shore and could not return to the ship in time. This left only about 80 Europeans on the flagship, along with an uncounted number of black slaves and Chinese merchants taking refuge on board. The Japanese boats focused on boarding the larger carrack, and at one point climbed aboard from the stern and shot a musket at Pereira, denting his helmet. The Japanese then made their way into the great cabin, briefly holding the captain-major hostage and carrying off his <b>writing</b> <b>desk</b> before being repelled. The flotilla's focus on the carrack left it exposed to the Portuguese galleon, which was able to support the carrack by catching the Japanese flotilla in the two ships' crossfire. The cannons wrought much havoc in the frail Japanese boats that the Hirado forces, after losing 3 ships and over 70 men, in addition to over 200 wounded, withdrew to their base crestfallen. The battle lasted two hours. The victorious carrack, suffering only 8 lives lost, set sail for Macao at the end of November.|$|E

500|$|After {{leaving the}} Forest Service in 1928, Marshall worked to {{complete}} his studies for a PhD in plant physiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The following year {{he made his first}} trip to Alaska, visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the central Brooks Range, and preparing for an extended stay for study. [...] The scientific objective of the trip was to study tree growth at the northern timberline near the Arctic Divide. For his 15-month sojourn {{in the small town of}} Wiseman, Alaska, Marshall rented a one-room cabin next to the only roadhouse in the village. He furnished it with books, records, a phonograph player, and a <b>writing</b> <b>desk.</b> [...] He placed the desk so that he could sit by the cabin's single window and admire the view of the Koyukuk River and the range of steep, snow-covered mountains in the background. [...] His travels engendered in him a great love for the central Brooks Range in the Alaskan wilderness. [...] Marshall was one of the first to explore much of the range, especially the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River, where he bestowed the name [...] "Gates of the Arctic" [...] on a pair of mountains, Boreal Mtn.

500|$|Between July 16 and July 19, {{at home on}} her own <b>writing</b> <b>desk,</b> Stanton {{edited the}} grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, {{politician}} and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating [...] "extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests." [...] On her own, Stanton added a more radical point {{to the list of}} grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights. To the grievances, she added [...] "He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of [...] "the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation..." [...] Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife [...] "you will turn the proceedings into a farce." [...] He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} further self-referential material, as a {{film about}} a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing Miller's Crossing). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, {{but he does not}} heed it. However, when he puts the mysterious package on his <b>writing</b> <b>desk</b> (which might have contained her head), she might have been helping him posthumously, in other ways. The movie itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with Mayhew's scripts, Barton Fink contains a [...] "good wrestler" [...] (Barton, it seems) and a [...] "bad wrestler" [...] (Charlie) who [...] "confront" [...] each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his [...] "common man" [...] neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the [...] "simple morality tales" [...] and [...] "road maps" [...] offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.|$|E
