25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
500|$|But unlike {{previous}} allegorical literature {{with these}} themes, such as John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all {{of the actions}} in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every thing <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, {{did not think of}} God." ...|$|E

500|$|Rise Against's {{extensive}} touring schedule {{not only}} helped {{to establish an}} early fanbase, but also {{attracted the attention of}} major record labels, including Dreamworks Records. The general consensus among Fat Wreck Chords musicians was that major record labels sacrifice musical integrity in exchange for commercial profit. Rise Against held the same belief, but eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} unlike other labels, DreamWorks supported their politically charged lyrics. According to McIlrath: [...] "Their faith in what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> the fact that they cared about stuff we cared about was an eye-opener." [...] The band signed with Dreamworks in September 2003, and was given complete creative control to record their major record label debut album, Siren Song of the Counter Culture.|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where <b>we</b> <b>do</b> (<b>and</b> where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E

In an interview for The Creators Project, Nilsson explained how the videos were conceptualized: [...] "The concept of this was born after long evenings of me and the band talking about gene technology in contemporary science. We share a mutual excitement in what's happening on the medical scene right now." [...] "The Wave" [...] was filmed before [...] "Paddling Out", although the latter was released first. Wyatt explained to Billboard, [...] "We really liked [...] Andreas's images and I think they go together in a way that feels truthful with what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> ... <b>and</b> you can read into it in different ways." ...|$|E

500|$|The Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons {{focuses on}} the {{conscience}} of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII ("the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable".|$|E

The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, {{when they came to}} learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for [...] "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from [...] "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. [...] "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. She loved it and that's how we went about it," [...] he added. The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, [...] "as that's the kind of music <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> it was also about adding our signature." [...] Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, [...] "Judas". The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian track list of Born This Way.|$|E

2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas about what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen {{the way that it}} does.|$|E

Rabbi Azariah {{in the name}} of Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon explained in a parable. A mortal king had a daughter whom he loved exceedingly. So long as his daughter was small, he would speak with her in public or in the courtyard. When she grew up and reached puberty, the king determined that it no longer befit his daughter's dignity for him to converse with her in public. So he directed that a pavilion be made for her so that he could speak with his daughter inside the pavilion. In the same way, when God saw the Israelites in Egypt, they were in the childhood of their nationhood, as [...] says, [...] "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son." [...] When God saw the Israelites at Sinai, God spoke with them as [...] says, [...] "The Lord spoke with you face to face." [...] As soon as they received the Torah, became God's nation, and said (as reported in [...] ), [...] "All that the Lord has spoken will <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> obey," [...] God observed that it was no longer in keeping with the dignity of God's children that God should converse with them in the open. So God instructed the Israelites to make a Tabernacle, and when God needed to communicate with the Israelites, God did so from the Tabernacle. And thus [...] bears this out when it says, [...] "And when Moses went into the tent of meeting that He might speak with him." ...|$|E
