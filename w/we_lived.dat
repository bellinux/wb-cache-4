He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

25|$|Frith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a sextet {{and review}} band for {{performing}} selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions {{from the previous}} 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), René Lussier (guitar, bass guitar), Jean Derome (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and Kevin Norton (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union. A double CD, That House <b>We</b> <b>Lived</b> In, from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Beatty's early {{education}} concentrated on horsemanship, hunting {{and learning to}} be a gentleman. Beatty had {{a close relationship with}} his elder brother Charles, who became his ally against their oppressive and overbearing father. They remained close throughout life, {{so much so that the}} only time Beatty felt despair was at his brother's death. Beatty later wrote to his wife about Charles, <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> together, played together, rode together, fought together. His brothers would later join the British Army, but early on young David developed an interest in ships and the sea and expressed a desire to join the Royal Navy. In 1881 Beatty's grandfather died and David Longfield succeeded to the 18th century mansion, 'Borodale', outside Enniscorthy, in County Wexford. After retiring from the army David Longfield established a business training horses first in Cheshire and then at 'The Mount', near Rugby, Warwickshire. On inheriting and following the death of his wife at 'The Mount', David Longfield returned to Ireland abandoning the training business.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

At the end of the fighting, Fogelman became a Robinson, hiding in a bunker on Szczęśliwa Street, where he began writing a diary.
