Further, the screenplay also {{gives the impression that}} the successful original production of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the Great Depression. In fact Show Boat ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.|$|E

The club is in a heated discussion of Stephen King's Carrie, when they are interrupted by <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an earthquake. The group leaves Juliet's house and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), previously known as [...] "Henry Gale" [...] to the survivors, appears along with Ethan Rom (William Mapother), looking up to watch Oceanic Flight 815 break apart in mid-air. Ben quickly orders Goodwin (Brett Cullen) and Ethan to join the survivors, stay undercover, and provide [...] "lists in three days." [...] The camera zooms out to reveal that the suburb is actually on the Island and is inhabited by The Others, while in the background the smoke trail of the midsection and tail section of Flight 815 can be seen.|$|E

500|$|... "Regal Zone", {{featuring}} saxophone by McKay, also {{covers the}} subject of war and is about the conflict in Iran. [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] addresses the use of placebos in medicine, while [...] "Icon" [...] displays echoes of iconoclasm, with the destruction of paintings featuring religious images, or statues and symbols of old authoritarian regimes. [...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, [...] "an expression of claustrophobia, of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line [...] "We're all sisters and brothers" [...] looked like {{a mockery of the}} Summer of Love.

Film director Harmony Korine wrote [...] "Harm of Will"'s lyrics. The Slate album review noted the minimalist nature of the track, pointing out a lack of hook, beat and melody. [...] It is a slow song, as is the closing track, [...] "Unison". The latter [...] " [...] a refrain directly inspired by [...] experience in Dancer in the Dark and a healthy dollop of self-effacing humor evoked to counter the balance". It [...] "brings beats and strings together in a final crescendo that also manages to incorporate a little jungle".|$|E
500|$|Megan Gibson from Time was {{disappointed}} with the single, feeling {{that it was not}} [...] "particularly good", and called the music as trite, uninspiring and bland. Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine was polarized with the song, stating that while it lowered his expectations for the album, he expressed that the saxophone solo was [...] "admittedly a high point, and one of the more original ideas that Gaga has had of late." [...] Sal Cinquemani, from the same publication, felt that the song [...] "isn't retro so much as retrograde, starting off with some crafty Art of Noise synth tones before morphing into <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the theme song to an early-'90s sitcom, or an inspirational sports flick, as sung by Bonnie Tyler." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also gave a mixed review about the song, calling it a [...] "Springsteen-on-steroids bombast" [...] and adding that it features [...] "Clarence Clemons doing almost a parody of a Clarence Clemons sax solo." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Oceania" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the song [...] "one of those polarizing songs, with its Ethel Merman-like synchronized vocal sweeps that do suggest the aquatic, in a 1950s sort of way". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman labeled the track as a [...] "strikingly beautiful" [...] song. Alex Ross, reporter writing for The New Yorker stated that with [...] "Oceania", Björk [...] "confirmed {{her status as}} the ultimate musical cosmopolitan", acquainted with Karlheinz Stockhausen and the Wu-Tang Clan. Matthew Gasteier from Prefix magazine called the track [...] "the best song on the album", whilst complimenting [...] "its swooping chorus [...] recalls the migration of birds or the time-elapsed drifting of icebergs, a swirl of beauty and power crashing down onto and then rising above the mix. It culminates in the near screech that leads into the sexy-spooky coda". According to Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club, in a positive review, [...] "the electronic flourish strays from her organic vocal focus, but Björk summons {{the same kind of}} tingle with choral language" [...] in the song, [...] "which finds The London Choir reacting to <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a thrilling slow-motion circus act".|$|E
500|$|... "Rain" [...] is a pop ballad with {{influence}} from trip hop and new-age music. Styled in adult contemporary format, {{the song is}} more [...] "friendly" [...] in its sound than the other singles released from Erotica. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is written in the key note of E major. The song's tempo {{is set in a}} moderate pace, but not too fast and has a metronome of 92 beats per minute. [...] "Rain" [...] begins with Madonna singing [...] "I feel it, it's coming", and followed by the chord progression of Esus2–A6/9–Bsus in the chorus and later A–B–E in the verse. A dark sounding C minor string and an echoing hi-hat accompanies Madonna's vocals, which are sung in her lowest register. The song's arrangement captures turbulent elements associated with rain (such as thunder), orchestral stabs that invokes crisp lightning bolts, and a surging bridge segue driven by <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> electric guitar snarls. A key change happens towards the end from B major to C major, followed by two spoken parts and a harmony alongside it. The coda has another melody with it, and the song ends in a group chorus without the harmonies.|$|E
500|$|... "Start Over" [...] earned mixed to {{positive}} reviews from critics, {{some of whom}} felt it was too similar to Knowles's older material. [...] MTV's Jenna Hally Rubenstein wrote that in the song, Knowles shows her best side, which according to her were the [...] "larger-than-life, emotionally tortured, breathy ballads." [...] Writing for MTV UK, Joanne Dorken concluded that the song was [...] "stonking and dramatic" [...] but also [...] "single-worthy." [...] Dorken added: [...] "Knowles shows off that big voice of hers, leaving us wanting more from the lady herself." [...] While reviewing 4, Gary Graff of Billboard magazine noted that several songs on the album, including [...] "Start Over", were talking about [...] "the gray areas in between". Erika Ramirez of the same magazine said: [...] "Again honest {{when it comes to}} love, Bey' won't surrender till she and beau 'give love another life.' Bey's roar matches the song's fight." [...] Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Start Over" [...] was the first indication that Knowles might have picked [...] "some leftfield influences during those nine months off", making reference to the way the song starts, as he wrote, [...] "with <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> – but most probably isn't – distorted pan pipes before kicking into a massive R number." ...|$|E

Mike Duffy, a Knight Ridder correspondent, wrote a largely positive {{article on the}} episode, noting that although the episode was special, this {{did not make it}} feel like a gimmick. He wrote, [...] "when most shows blow promotional smoke about 'a very special episode,' it's best to check the Hollywood Hype-O-Meter for wretched, excessive buzzing [...] <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a gimmick—'a very special black-and-white episode' loosely based on the horror movie classic Frankenstein actually {{turns out to be a}} ripping good ride on 'X-Files' creator Chris Carter's wigged-out storytelling train." [...] A review from the Mobile Register wrote that [...] "Like the very best X-Files episodes, this one combines a generous amount of humor with its horror." [...] In a review of the entire fifth season, Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] was the [...] "most striking" [...] of the season's stand-alone episodes. Todd VanDerWerff awarded the episode with an [...] "A" [...] grade, and, despite noting the silliness of the story and the fact that most of the characters function as stereotypes, wrote that [...] "'Prometheus' just works". In a 2000 review of season five for the New Straits Times, Francis Dass called [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] a [...] "fun episode".|$|E
500|$|According to Mark Redfern of Under the Radar, Blur eschewed Britpop {{in favour}} of American indie rock. NME {{magazine}} similarly argued that it favoured lo-fi and alternative rock over Britpop. By contrast, Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle characterised its music as [...] "a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop", while AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it [...] "may superficially {{appear to be a}} break from tradition" [...] but is a [...] "logical progression" [...] from Britpop rather than an abandonment of it. Album opener [...] "Beetlebum" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "Beatles tribute" [...] by several publications; Erlewine wrote that the song [...] " [...] through the White Album in the space of five minutes." [...] Q magazine's Andrew Collins compared the song to The Auteurs as well as a [...] "slightly menacing Free as a Bird", due to [...] "a slight drone undulating in the foreground" [...] and a [...] "sweet, elongated coda busied by <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an invasion of turkeys." [...] Albarn admitted that [...] "Beetlebum" [...] was about heroin and the drug experiences he had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica. Albarn also stated that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of [...] "sleepy" [...] and sort of [...] "sexy". The song's title is a reference to the phrase [...] "Chasing the beetle" [...] which refers to inhaling the smoke from heated heroin, morphine, or opium that has been placed on a piece of tin-foil. [...] "Song 2" [...] is notable for its hook which features Albarn yelling [...] "woo-hoo!" [...] The song's intro has been called Coxon's [...] "finest moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, {{just give me a}} little bit more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance before things become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim {{from music}} critics. Brittany Mahaney of ANDPOP praised the song's playful demeanor, and called [...] "Jumanji" [...] a summer anthem. Mahaney further elaborated that the song [...] "practically screams summer with dance worthy steel drums and timpani hits". On a similar note, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard also deemed the song an anthem. Lipshutz also compared Banks's {{performance in the}} song to the works of Cam'ron and early Ghostface Killah, claiming it was [...] "a great thing". Using a similar comparison, Jonah Weiner of Slate commented that the song [...] "channels the sort of hip-hop that dominated New York in the early- to mid-'00s—in particular, the triumphal cacophony and inspired gobbledygook of Cam'ron and his Harlem crew, the Diplomats". Weiner went on to commend the track's [...] "comically [...] " [...] percussion, but heavily praised the song's relaxed tempo, stating it [...] "better accommodates kingly rapping". Huw Nolan of Ripe lauded the song, calling it [...] "classic Azealia". Mark Richardson, writing for Pitchfork, gave the song the [...] "Best New Track" [...] honor, stating, [...] "her rapping really functions as the bedrock, the steady pulse for the production (by Hudson Mohawke and Nick Hook) to swirl around". Richardson used the aforementioned metaphor throughout his review, comparing the production on the song to Rustie's mix featured on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix, before ending the review by saying, [...] "She [...] can rap." [...] Reviewing the song's parent mixtape for the same publication, Marc Hogan lauded the [...] " [...] rapidfire verses and an instantly quotable 'real bitch, all day/ Uptown, Broadway' hook over <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> elephants escaping from an urban zoo". Placing the song on Pretty Much Amazings [...] "Tracking 2012's Best Songs" [...] list, Genevieve Oliver opined the song exemplified [...] "Azealia's jittery, relentless, rapid-fire energy and smart, sarcastic lyrics" [...] aesthetic. Also writing for Pretty Much Amazing, Drewwmalmuth wrote {{a review of the}} track's parent mixtape, and praised [...] "Jumanji", [...] "Nathan", and [...] "Fuck Up the Fun" [...] for being [...] "commercially viable", but lamented that the tracks weren't [...] "aren't as gripping as the highest points of the tape".|$|E

Raggett said it [...] "shares title and inspiration with the similarly named Laid song but takes a much different direction, with <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Indian violin contributing to a slow-paced, serene wash of sound." [...] "Honest Joe" [...] is a [...] "solid, techno-tinged trip". [...] "Rhythmic Dreams" [...] relies on a steady jungly drumbeat and mantra-like vocals to give the piece shape.

2500|$|The {{tone of the}} Moria {{sequence}} was altered. In the book, {{following the}} defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against {{the resistance of the}} rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting [...] "there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there," [...] though no one seems to think this likely. [...] Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. [...] They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. [...] The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria. One detail that many critics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria ("They then hear <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a hammer tapping in the distance"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in ("Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket.

2500|$|Fitzmaurice found [...] "Polish Girl" [...] to {{be similar}} to the song [...] "Reunion" [...] by Canadian band Stars, as both songs depict someone trying to recover, and yearning for, young love. Palomo asks {{questions}} in the song that are likely to be unanswered, such as [...] "Do I still cross your mind?/ Your face still distorts the time". Cooke noted the [...] "dazzling syncopated pulse" [...] {{to be similar}} to the coin sound effect in games from the Mario series, and has melodies that [...] "splash and slide around sickly-sweet flurries of arpeggios and a family-friendly feel-good beat". Blurt said that the song includes <b>what</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> samples from the game Super Mario World, and has the joyful energy of Cut Copy's album Zonoscope. Beats per Minute writer Aurora Mitchell said the song [...] "sounds like 80s disco distorted through an old computer", while AllMusic noted the song sounded more like Palomo's other project Vega than Neon Indian. [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] includes elements of alternative rock, grunge and garage rock. Club Fonograma writer Blanca Méndez said that [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] is about the [...] "staying-at-home-and-staring-at-ceilings early stage" [...] of a breakup, which is [...] "the one in which you allow yourself to wallow in the pain because you deserve at least that much". Méndez noted the song's [...] "tinny layers of sound" [...] and Palomo's [...] "breathy, almost frustrated vocals". The electro-shoegaze song [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] addresses an ex-girlfriend, and includes video game synth timbres similar to those on Psychic Chasms opener [...] "(AM)".
