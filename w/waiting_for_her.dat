5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster.

Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home.

5|$|Constellation {{began taking}} on {{prisoners of war}} from L'Insurgente, but by nightfall the two ships had become {{separated}} in a storm. Left aboard L'Insurgente were Constellations First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter, and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into L'Insurgentes lower holds. Finally, after three nights, L'Insurgente {{was brought in to}} Saint Kitts where Constellation was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, Constellations troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons. At the American prize court in Norfolk, Virginia, L'Insurgente was condemned to be sold as a war prize, with the proceeds distributed to the crew of Constellation. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing L'Insurgente and commissioning her in the United States Navy as the USS Insurgent.|$|E

5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
