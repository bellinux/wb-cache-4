50|$|The term {{trunking}} {{is used in}} the United Kingdom for electrical <b>wireways,</b> generally rectangular {{in cross}} section with removable lids.|$|E
50|$|Mini {{trunking}} is a {{term used}} in the UK for small form-factor (usually 6 mm to 25 mm square or rectangle sectioned) PVC <b>wireways.</b>|$|E
50|$|In North American practice, wire trough and lay-in <b>wireways</b> are terms used to {{designate}} similar products. Wall duct raceway {{is the name}} give to the type that can be enclosed in a wall.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wireway</b> {{also serves}} as a {{mounting}} structure but typically contains only wiring. It is thinner and broader than a raceway, and may also be used as a backer panel for the channel letter set.|$|R
50|$|Channel {{letters may}} be flush mounted (attached {{directly}} to the building facade), {{or they may be}} mounted on a raceway or <b>wireway.</b> A raceway is a rectangular mounting structure which serves as both a container for the sign's electrical components (such as a power supply) and a mounting structure.|$|R
50|$|Perrault {{also had}} a role in {{developing}} the MIL Spec Standards used in building Naval Ships in the United States. As with the creation and patent of the compact <b>wireway</b> arrangement for ships, among others, the Navy amended the Electric Plant Installation Standard Methonds to includes his arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Telecommunications {{power cable}} is {{intended}} for use in AC/DC distribution circuits, <b>wireways,</b> racks, and conduits installed in telecommunications Central Offices (COs), transmission stations, cell-tower sites, and other remote sites. These environments are normally dry, but cables may be placed in partially covered or protected porches, crawl spaces, or in underground vaults where water and high moisture levels can occur.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontal cabling wiring can be IW (inside wiring) or plenum cabling and connects {{telecommunications}} {{rooms to}} individual outlets or work {{areas on the}} floor, usually through the <b>wireways,</b> conduits or ceiling spaces of each floor. A horizontal cross-connect is where the horizontal cabling connects to a patch panel or punch up block, which is connected by backbone cabling to the main distribution facility.|$|E
40|$|This is the {{electric}} {{portion of the}} design guidelines for gloveboxes developed by the American Glovebox Society. The topics include applicable codes/industry standards, penetrations/feedthroughs, <b>wireways,</b> junction boxes, receptacles, derating factors, conductors, conductor insulation and grounding. References for the guidelines are provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} this thesis is the {{cognition}} of theoretical basis for measuring on optical fibres, elements and optical <b>wireway</b> as well. This work describes {{the methods of}} measuring and detection of parameters of these networks. The gained knowledge is followed by its application on two laboratory tasks. The first task is focused on usage of method of embedded loss for measuring of attenuation of fibre and followed by usage of the method OTDR for localization of defect. The second task is focused on measuring of attenuation on passive optical element using only the method of embedded losses. The laboratory tasks were described and respective conclusion and findings were drawed from each other...|$|R
5000|$|Pallet racking {{is often}} {{bought and sold}} {{multiple}} times. Every time the pallet rack is tore down, installed and moved around, the engineered pallet rack safety clips {{that came with the}} system are lost, damaged or no longer working. Due the difficulty of identifying pallet rack those safety clips can be hard to find when searching for the manufacturer who provides them. The pallet rack safety bolt has a universal design made specifically to work with several styles of pallet rack systems including: SpaceRak, Interlake, Ridg-U-Rak Teardrop, USP, Excel Storage Products, Bulldog, Hannibal, Steel King, <b>Wireway,</b> and many others. The key indicator to see if the universal pallet rack pin will work with used rack systems is finding the 2 [...]30" [...] holes that align in the pallet rack cross beam and upright frame.|$|R
