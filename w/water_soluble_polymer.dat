40|$|Abstract: Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is a <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>polymer</b> with a {{large number}} of {{commercial}} uses. This commercial success derives from its biological compatibility, low toxicity, film-forming and adhesive characteristics, unusual complexing ability, relatively inert behavior toward salts and acids, and its resistance to thermal degradation in solution. Because of these diverse properties, PVP finds important applications in the pharmaceutical, food, beverage, cosmetic, toiletry and photographic industries. The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the microstructure of PVP/collagen employing solution NMR, in order to better understand the blend behavior of polymer-polymer interactions. The PVP/collagen mixtures present signals from both polymers and the signals from C=C and/or aromatic C can be a source of information on polymer/polymer miscibility. Thus, other NMR measurements, such as 1 D spectral simplification, attached proton test (APT) and 2 D HETCOR {{will be part of the}} NMR methodology used to characterize this polymer/polymer system.

30|$|The {{polymer gel}} {{treatment}} {{is one of}} the most useful chemical methods to reduce water production[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Polymer gels are typically composed of a <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>polymer</b> and cross-linking agents which are dissolved in brine. After allowing sufficient time, the gelant solution sets into a semisolid mass and behaves as flow-diverting or blocking agent[10, 11, 12].

Other parameters to be considered for the proper selection of a given polymer gel system include salinity of the formation water, permeability of the target zone, and the lithology of the formation[20, 21].|$|E

High molecular weight anionic Polyacrylamide (a <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>polymer),</b> increases soil aggregate stability and flocculates suspended sediments, thereby reducing sediment detachment and transport in irrigation furrows. Application of 0. 7 kg/ha/irrigation of polyacrylamide in irrigation water has reduced furrow erosion by 85 to 99 %. In the present work, sediment movement and infiltration were measured in a recirculating furrow infiltrometer with two polyacrylamide treatments. Mean erosion reduction was 70 %. Polyacrylamide increased mean infiltration by 30 %, probably the result of reduced sediment movement and furrow surface seal formation. Infiltration was inversely related to maximum sediment concentration in the flowing water for both treated and untreated furrows.
