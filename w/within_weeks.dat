50|$|Lag BaOmer {{has another}} {{significance}} {{based on the}} Kabbalistic custom of assigning a Sefirah to each day and week of the Omer count. The first week corresponds to Chesed, the second week to Gevurah, etc., and similarly, {{the first day of}} each week corresponds to Chesed, the second day to Gevurah, etc. Thus, the 33rd day, which is the fifth day of the fifth week, corresponds to Hod she-be-Hod (Splendor <b>within</b> <b>week</b> of Splendor). As such, Lag BaOmer represents the level of spiritual manifestation or Hod that would precede the more physical manifestation of the 49th day (Malkhut she-be-Malkhut, Kingship <b>within</b> <b>week</b> of Kingship), which immediately precedes the holiday of Shavuot.|$|R

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection.

As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal <b>within</b> <b>weeks</b> or months if left untreated.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To examine if car {{painters}} {{who work}} with polyurethane paints that contain hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI) and hexamethylenediisocyanate biuret trimer (HDI-BT) develop acute as well as chronic impairment of lung function. METHODS [...] In this study data were reanalysed from two earlier studies {{on a group of}} car painters to see if a decrease in lung function <b>within</b> the <b>week</b> is a marker of vulnerability in those workers. Data on changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) <b>within</b> the <b>week</b> were available for 20 car painters who were also examined six years later. RESULTS [...] 10 men showed a decline in FVC <b>within</b> the <b>week.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} age, duration of employment, exposures during the follow up period, or smoking between car painters who had decline in lung function <b>within</b> the <b>week</b> and car painters who had not. A significant correlation was found between the change in FVC <b>within</b> the <b>week</b> and the long term (six year) change in FVC, standardised for the effects of aging and smoking, and adjusted for the number of peak exposures. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results suggest that the decrease in FVC <b>within</b> the <b>week</b> might serve as a guide to identify car painters at risk of a further decrement in lung function above the effects of aging, smoking, and exposure...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{a frequent}} complication in cirrhotic patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Hyponatremia (HN) is a known contributing risk factor {{for the development of}} HE. Predictive factors, especially the effect of HN, for the development of overt HE <b>within</b> one <b>week</b> of TIPS placement were assessed. A single-center, retrospective chart review of 71 patients with cirrhosis who underwent TIPS creation from 2006 – 2011 for non-variceal bleeding indications was conducted. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected. Factors associated with overt HE <b>within</b> one <b>week</b> were identified, and a multivariate model was constructed. Seventy one patients who underwent 81 TIPS procedures were evaluated. Fifteen patients developed overt HE <b>within</b> one <b>week.</b> Factors predictive of overt HE <b>within</b> one <b>week</b> included pre-TIPS Na, total bilirubin and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) -Na. The odds ratio for developing HE with pre-TIPS Na < 135 mEq/L was 8. 6. Among patients with pre-TIPS Na < 125 mEq/L, 125 – 129. 9 mEq/L, 130 – 134. 9 mEq/L and ≥ 135 mEq/L, the incidence of HE <b>within</b> one <b>week</b> was 37. 5 %, 25 %, 25 % and 3. 4 %, respectively. Lower pre-TIPS Na, higher total bilirubin and higher MELD-Na values were associated with the development of overt HE post-TIPS <b>within</b> one <b>week.</b> TIPS in hyponatremic patients should be undertaken with caution...|$|R
