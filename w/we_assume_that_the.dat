25|$|Sumati Shatakam, {{which is}} a neeti ("moral"), {{is one of the}} most famous Telugu Shatakams. Shatakam is {{composed}} of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (Telugu: బద్దెన భూపాల) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana. If <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya. The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|We now {{discuss the}} {{position}} using the superko rule. For simplicity, <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last move placed a stone {{in a position}} unoccupied {{since the beginning of}} the game, and away from the ko. Under positional and situational super ko, Black captures the white group. This is also the case with natural situational super ko if it is Black's turn. If it is White's turn however, then NSSK exhibits odd behavior. White can get a seki by passing, but only at the cost of allowing Black unlimited moves away from the ko. If White insists on saving their group, the final position might look like the second diagram. On the other hand, with the first move (which should be a pass), White wins by two points in the third position using NSSK (assuming area scoring). Black's best response, in terms of maximizing their score, is a pass.|$|E

500|$|Wood, Palsgraf's lawyer, {{moved the}} Court of Appeals to allow reargument of the case, alleging that Cardozo had {{confused}} {{the position of}} Palsgraf with that of her daughter Lillian (at the newsstand), and complained about the chief judge's use of such terms as [...] "distant" [...] and [...] "far away". Wood warned that the decision could have far-reaching adverse effects on innocent passengers. The court denied the motion with a one-sentence statement likely written by Cardozo, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff was nearer {{the scene of the}} explosion than the prevailing opinion would suggest, she was not so near that injury from a falling package, not known to contain explosives, would be within the range of reasonable prevision." [...] Costs of $559.60 were due from Palsgraf to the railroad under Cardozo's order. Posner doubted the sum was ever collected, noting that Palsgraf's family spoke to legal scholars and periodicals about the case in later years, and never mentioned an attempt to collect what would have been about a year's salary for the disabled former janitor.|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} part of orbital tuning is {{the choice of the}} initial tie point. For site U 1425, we used the dark layer no. 21 – 2 projection tie points of Tada et al. (2018), which are at 1.45 [*]Ma at 54.79 -m-core depth. These have an error margin of about 4  kyr, inherited from the LR 04 age model used as a tuning target. This error is negligible for our purposes, and for site U 1425, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposed depth-age model has no lag. It was more difficult to define the age model for site U 1430 {{because of the presence of}} the hiatus. Following Kamikuri et al.
