5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, <b>which</b> <b>emphasizes</b> constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E

5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism.
