40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{amended the}} Commodity Exchange Act and adopted an {{explicit}} prohibition regarding activity {{commonly known as}} spoofing in commodities markets. This Note argues that the spoofing prohibition is a necessary step towards improved market discipline and price integrity in the relevant commodities markets. It fills an important gap in the CEA in relation to an elusive form of price manipulation activity by providing an explicit statutory authority on which regulators and market operators may rely in policing suspect trading strategies falling under the spoofing umbrella. Congress’ explicit denouncement of spoofing as an illegal act has ramifications not only for traders, but also for brokers and market makers. In the past, when courts have considered the issue of secondary liability of brokers regarding manipulative activity of their customers {{in the context of}} <b>wash</b> <b>sales,</b> they have determined the CEA’s explicit prohibition of <b>wash</b> <b>sales</b> and the relatively easier identification of <b>wash</b> <b>sales</b> activity as important factors that may potentially increase the secondary liability risk of derivatives brokers. Applying the same analogy to spoofing, greater public awareness and the increasing visibility of spoofing activity (resulting from improvements in the monitoring systems of regulators and market operators) will provide strong incentives for market participants to adapt to changing norms. However, areas of concern, such as risk of selective enforcement and inconsistencies among the applicable market rules, will pose challenges in the spoofing prohibition’s implementation. Therefore, regulators must seek cooperation with relevant market operators to encourage structural reform and self-regulatory measures, such as implementation of appropriate structural safeguards into the trading infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a model of}} continuous-time financial market consisting of a bank ac-count with constant interest rate and one risky asset subject to capital gains taxes. We consider the problem of maximizing expected utility from future consumption in infi-nite horizon. This is the continuous-time version of the model introduced by Dammon, Spatt and Zhang [11]. The taxation rule is linear so that it allows for tax credits when capital gains losses are experienced. In this context, <b>wash</b> <b>sales</b> are optimal. Our main contribution is to derive lower and upper bounds on the value function {{in terms of the}} corresponding value in a tax-free and frictionless model. While the upper bound corresponds to the value function in a tax-free model, the lower bound is a consequence of <b>wash</b> <b>sales.</b> As an important implication of these bounds, we derive an explicit first order expansion of our value function for small interest rate and tax rate coefficients. In order to examine the accuracy of this approximation, we provide a characteriza-tion of the value function in terms of the associated dynamic programming equation, and we suggest a numerical approximation scheme based on finite differences and the Howard algorithm. The numerical results show that the first order Taylor expansion is reasonably accurate for reasonable market data.

40|$|Tax-Loss Trading and <b>Wash</b> <b>Sales</b> An {{analysis}} of trades in the Finnish stock market {{around the turn}} of the year 1994 - 95, 199596, and 1996 - 97 shows that Finnish investors tend to realize losses more than gains towards the end of December. They also buy back the same stocks they recently sold, with a repurchase rate that depends on the size of the capital loss and how close the sale is to the end of December. The resulting net buying pressure from these "wash sale" repurchases is greater for stocks with small market capitalizations and has a calendar pattern that is similar to that of stock returns.

5000|$|A <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> (not to be {{confused}} with a wash trade) is a sale of a security (stock, bonds, options) at a loss and repurchase of the same or substantially identical security shortly before or after. [...] The regulations around wash sales are to protect against an investor who holds an unrealized loss and wishes to make it claimable as a tax deduction within the current tax year. The security is then repurchased in the hope that it will recover its previous value, which would only become taxable in some future tax year. A <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> can take place {{at any time during the}} year. In the UK, a similar practice which specifically takes place at the end of a calendar year is known as bed and breakfasting. In a bed-and-breakfasting transaction, a position is sold on the last trading day of the year (typically late in the trading session) to establish a tax loss. The same position is then repurchased early on the first session of the new trading year, to restore the position (albeit at a lower cost basis). The term, therefore, derives its name from the late sale and early morning repurchase.|$|E
50|$|Section 1256 {{contract}} net losses can {{be carried}} back 3 years (instead of being carried forward to the following year), starting with the earliest year, but only {{to a year in}} which there is a net Section 1256 contracts gain, and only up to the extent of such gain (the carrying back cannot produce a net operating loss for the year), using Form 1045 or an amended return. In addition, futures based investments do not require the accounting of individual trades. This greatly simplifies the process of determining the cost basis for positions acquired over several years. There is also no trade by trade accounting in futures, and no <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> rules. Tax reporting for Section 1256 contracts is significantly simpler than for stocks, options, and single-stock-futures.|$|E
50|$|Example: Some {{time ago}} you bought 80 shares of XYZ at $50. The stock has {{declined}} to $30, and you sell it to take the loss deduction. But then you see some good news on XYZ and buy it back for $32, less than 31 days after the sale. You can't deduct your loss of $20 per share. But you add $20 per share to the basis of your replacement shares. Those shares have a basis of $52 per share: the $32 you paid, plus the $20 <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> adjustment. In other words, you're treated as if you bought the shares for $52. If you end up selling them for $55, you'll only report $3 per share of gain. And if you sell them for $32 (the same price you paid to buy them), you'll report a loss of $20 per share.|$|E
40|$|Current {{rules on}} market {{manipulation}} ignore the existing and rapidly {{growing body of}} scholarship on how securities prices are formed in markets. These rules are primarily reactive, and depend on vague and difficult measures such as the “artificiality ” of a resulting market price or the trader’s intention.

The playing field between high-powered and retail traders has become so uneven that soon our original understanding of securities markets will be eclipsed.

50|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been a number of {{algorithmic}} trading malfunctions that caused substantial market disruptions. These raise concern about firms' ability to develop, implement and effectively supervise their automated systems. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has stated that it will assess whether firms' testing and controls related to algorithmic trading and other automated trading strategies and trading systems are adequate in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and firms' supervisory obligations. This assessment may take the form of examinations and targeted investigations. Firms will be required to address whether they conduct separate, independent and robust pre-implementation testing of algorithms and trading systems and whether the firm's legal, compliance and operations staff are reviewing the design and development of the algorithms and trading systems for compliance with legal requirements. FINRA will review whether a firm actively monitors and reviews algorithms and trading systems once they are placed into production systems and after they have been modified, including procedures and controls used to detect potential trading abuses such as <b>wash</b> <b>sales,</b> marking, layering and momentum ignition strategies. Finally, firms will need to describe their approach to firm-wide disconnect or “kill” switches, as well as procedures for responding to catastrophic system malfunctions.|$|R

Our results show that <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> constraints can cause investors to deviate substantially from the portfolio they would otherwise have chosen.

This trading behavior is to a large extent driven by the desire to realize those losses either immediately by sharply decreasing the holding of assets carrying unrealized losses or indirectly by increasing such holdings in the first period in order to prepare for a decrease in the next period to earn the tax rebate payment.

40|$|The “Net Present Value {{after tax}} ” of a {{portfolio}} {{at a given}} time is the relevant variable to measure performance of financial strategies. Prior to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) a variety of transactions with derivatives could be used to defer income and to accelerate loss. ERTA has led to significant restrictions to use straddles for tax motivated purposes. Additionally <b>wash</b> <b>sale</b> and constructive sale rules, which interact with the straddle rule, prevent the investor to use derivatives to reduce tax payments. In this thesis we develop a synthesizing technique using derivative instruments to circumvent these problems. These hedging positions created are uncorrelated to the original position — they do not comprise a straddle — although their composition is economically offsetting. With this technique it is possible to pass <b>wash</b> <b>sale,</b> constructive sale and the straddle rules. We will illustrate this in two case studies. First, we consider a company, which uses derivatives for hedging purposes. Second, we use an enhanced version applied to an individual who wants to increase his after tax income significantly. We illustrate the strategies using the Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, the risk is measured by Value at Risk method (VaR). Although we mainly focus to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the USA, we want to mention that the strategy works in other countries in a similar way. We will indicate the differences, when they are due. Acknowledgement...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{formulate}} a computationally tractable {{extension of the}} classical Merton optimal consumptioninvestment problem to include the capital gains taxes. This is the continuous-time version of the model introduced by Dammon, Spatt, and Zhang [Rev. Financ. Stud., 14 (2001), pp. 583 - 616]. In this model the tax basis is computed as {{the average cost of}} the stocks in the investor's portfolio. This average rule introduces only one additional state variable, namely the tax basis. Since the other tax rules such as the first in first out rule require the knowledge of all past transactions, the average model is computationally much easier. We emphasize the linear taxation rule, which allows for tax credits when capital gains losses are experienced. In this context <b>wash</b> <b>sales</b> are optimal, and we prove it rigorously. Our main contributions are a first order explicit approximation of the value function of the problem and a unique characterization by means of the corresponding dynamic programming equation. The latter characterization builds on technical results isolated in the accompanying paper [I. Ben Tahar, H. M. Soner, and N. Touzi, SIAM J. Control Optim., 46 (2007), pp. 1779 - 1801].
