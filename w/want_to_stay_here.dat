2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, Arn Tellem, {{to see about}} a possible trade. [...] "We want to see what's out there," [...] Redick told the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> but it's been frustrating." [...] Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: [...] "Right now {{it would be very}} hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things." [...] The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb 21 trade deadline. In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

6000|$|... "He'll {{not live}} on me again," [...] {{declared}} Andy. [...] "I know him thoroughly, now. If he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> he'll have <b>to</b> work, {{the same as}} I do." ...|$|R
5000|$|I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live in Alberta. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> This {{is where}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> live. It's nice <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> home. You couldn't {{get a better}} place than the Maritimes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I won't go!--I don't {{want him}} to come!' she sobbed. 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> with you, or anywhere, except where he can come!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see I want to {{get back}} to Uncle Dan'l an' Guilford," [...] he said, confidentially; [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> a single minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, when {{he leaves}} me alone," [...] {{retorted}} Dick. He turned to Harry Moss and Joe Davis. [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> any longer?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{contentious}} words, Perović signed-off {{with a positive}} note, saying [...] "The whole truth is that I love Boston, club and fans and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> my entire career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} are making a big mistake," [...] he said, with an {{assumption}} of carelessness which was far from natural. [...] "I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> till I could get a job." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wyllard laughed. [...] "From all {{appearances}} we might wait a month. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up <b>here</b> any longer than is strictly necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would serve}} him {{with all my}} heart, but I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> I love the Castle of Montemar better, and my mother has no one but me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the Ork can fly, but we can't," [...] {{explained}} Trot, in answer. [...] "We don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> a bit, but I don't {{see how we}} can get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, I'm not. I {{want to be}} let come; I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> I know I'll {{get into}} {{mischief}} if you don't take me--oh, I know I will!" ...|$|E

50|$|Austin loses {{five pounds}} and Ken loses four. Hannah loses three pounds which pushes Ken below the yellow line, but also puts her {{in danger of}} falling below as well. Kaylee is the last to weigh in and tells of the new fire she found in herself this week and how much she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> <b>To</b> <b>stay</b> safe, she needs to lose more than 3 pounds and she obliterates that by losing five pounds, which is really nine pounds when {{considering}} her weight gain from last week.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Wrenn felt a good {{wholesome}} {{desire to}} spank her, but he said, most politely: [...] "You're awful tired. Don't you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> tonight? Or maybe some other hotel; and I'll stay here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “More than likely,” groaned Giles Borden. “Now {{that they}} have my money they won’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here.</b> They’ll take passage on that ship {{as soon as she}} comes in and leave me to shift for myself.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know as I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up <b>here</b> gossiping," [...] she remarked. [...] "You'd {{much better}} be {{getting on with}} your work. Give me one of those cigarettes, anyway," [...] she added abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty turned {{towards her}} with a flash in her eyes. [...] "I know just what you mean, {{and it would be}} nicer just to look as if I never felt anything, as some of those English folks you were fond of did; but I can't. I wasn't made that way. Still, I'm not going to {{apologize}} for my father. He is Torrance of Cedar, and I'm standing in with him--but if I were a man I'd go down and whip Clavering. I could almost have shaken him when he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and tried <b>to</b> make me ask him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. What you <b>want</b> is, <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> quite quietly, just as {{if nothing}} had happened, whilst the friend of whom I spoke just now went and got back that key which is causing so much trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|James Forsyte replied, {{tumbling}} {{over his}} own words: [...] "Why! what do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> for? There's nothing {{for you to do}} here--there's nothing to see here, unless you go up the Citadel, an' you won't do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Cap'n Bill, [...] "you've {{got to go}} home, anyhow, 'cause {{you don't}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here,</b> I take it. And, when you get home, it wouldn't worry you much to tell the Wizard what's {{happened}} to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> a {{good many}} days," [...] said Waldron, [...] "to see the steamers and the dockyards. They are {{building}} a monstrous iron ship, somewhere here. She {{is going to be}} five hundred tons bigger than the Baltic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, come along," [...] {{the other}} said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>staying</b> <b>here</b> all night. Your dagger isn't here, that's certain, and as I am off guard at present, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be going." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think {{everyone}} knows how I feel about being at this football club. The supporters, players and management have been absolutely fantastic to me over these past {{four months and}} I desperately <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> because I love it so much. I know I have only been here a few months, but it really does feel like I {{have been here for}} years.

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. There are so {{many things}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do. Those flowers in the garden are calling me--and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go down to that hollow and pick buttercups--and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>here</b> and look at things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot," [...] she murmured. [...] "You {{looked as}} though you were posing for a statue of some one in exile," [...] she observed. [...] "Come, let us go a little lower down--unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and be blown to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Caleb, I {{have a great}} mind to go {{and feed}} your {{squirrel}} for you, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> and help the boys to make the mole. In fact, I should like to buy him of you, {{if you would like}} to sell him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't you go now?" [...] pleaded Trot. [...] "We don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> {{any longer}} than we can help, and {{everybody}} in Oz will be interested in you, and call you a hero, and say nice things about you because you helped your friends out of trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry was {{speaking}} of you," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "This {{will be a}} good chance for you to show him that he is mistaken.

6000|$|... "We ain't layin' {{anything}} up agin you 'cause you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> round <b>here,</b> for we don't blame you, seeing how you've {{got a good}} home to go to; an' if we had one we should tear round worse'n you do.
