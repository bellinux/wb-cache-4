500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about, and all the good things that could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Marino {{was cast}} in November 2015, on which Fazekas said, [...] "He’s {{obviously}} very funny, but he also is a great dramatic actor. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about him for a different role, {{but it was too}} small of a role. Then we knew we wanted him in [...] Manfredi role. So that role became so much bigger because it was Ken." [...] About the character, Fazekas added, [...] "What I love about Manfredi is he’s funny, he can flip on a dime and be a total psycho, and he is madly in love with Whitney and genuinely so—even when she’s cuckoo. Their scenes together, there’s such a tenderness to them". Since the character differs from its comic counterpart, Marino said [...] "the two things [...] " [...] were defining that Manfredi [...] "definitely was the muscle for Whitney, and that he did have a true love for her." [...] Marino wanted to make sure Manfredi [...] "felt like he was an old-school tough guy" [...] and felt that Frost was [...] "the one true love for him", comparing their relationship to Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe's.|$|E

500|$|According to McEntire, Clarkson was {{the first}} singer to pair up with her for the album [...] (2007). She also claimed that [...] "Because of You" [...] was not the {{original}} song {{to be included in}} the album; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson, titled [...] "A Lot Like You." [...] McEntire explained that it was Narvel, her husband, who convinced her to go back in the studio and record [...] "Because of You" [...] after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song. She expressed, [...] "Narvel saw it. That wasn't one of the songs <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about recording – matter of fact, Kelly and I had already recorded a song, 'A Lot Like You,' for the duet project, and he said, 'You've got to do this one together,' so we did." [...] Musically, the song is different from the original version. Thom Jhurek of Allmusic described the duet version as [...] "a big, overblown power ballad" [...] which incorporates [...] "guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals." [...] The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet, giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed [...] "unnecessary" [...] by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics. The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15, 2007, as the lead single from the album. It was added to country radio playlists on May 28, 2007.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the [...] "Develop" [...] {{conference in}} July 2012, Perry {{released}} a statement that he's {{sure there will be}} another Earthworm Jim game. He claimed the problem was [...] "when", not [...] "if", as, while the development team members discuss the project actively, they are all busy with their separate projects and companies. A possible premise he outlined was, [...] "The thing <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about in the past is Jim had been in retirement...So, he's been sitting at home watching movies and eating popcorn. He's grossly overweight now. The plan was to start with him literally getting off the sofa, and it's a disaster because he just hasn't done anything since. But he's got to get back into action again." [...] While details regarding just how much Jim being out of shape would affect game design are still up in the air, Perry mentioned being pretty certain that the game would be played in 2D.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, ABC {{president}} Paul Lee {{said the}} network had {{passed on the}} series. Later that year, Rosenberg was shopping the show around to other networks, saying [...] "I don’t know if it’s an ABC show. It might be a cable show, really. The [...] graphic novel {{is the first one}} that Marvel did that was meant to serve an adult audience. I toned it down a little bit for network, but it’s very, very easy to translate that into cable. Very easy." [...] In October 2013, Deadline reported that Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. A few weeks later, Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Rosenberg was brought on to write and produce the new incarnation of the series, to be reconfigured from her original project, which she called a [...] "page one do-over" [...] from her original vision. Liz Friedman also serves as an executive producer on the series during the first season. In December 2014, the official title was revealed to be Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones. However, in June 2015, Marvel revealed that the title for the series would be shortened to Marvel's Jessica Jones. On why the title was shortened, Loeb said, [...] "It literally just became {{one of those things that}} happens. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about whether that was the best title for it, and that’s how it happened." [...] Rosenberg added that the [...] "AKA" [...] is [...] "living in the episodes. You'll still see it." ...|$|E
