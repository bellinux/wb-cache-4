5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E

40|$|Background: According to WHO estimates, {{tuberculosis}} case detection rate in Tanzania is {{less than}} 50 % and this poses a major challenge to control tuberculosis in the country. Currently, one of the defining criteria for suspecting tuberculosis is cough for two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> We {{wanted to find out}} whether the prevalence of tuberculosis was different in patients who reported cough for two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> compared to patients with cough for less than two weeks. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in six health facilities in Dar es Salaam, between September and October 2007. All patients aged five years and above with cough were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) by smear microscopy. Patients were divided into two groups, those who coughed for less than two weeks (< 2 wks) and those who coughed for two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> (³ 2 wks). Results: A total of 65, 530 patients attended outpatients department (OPD). Out of these, 2274 (3. 5 %) patients reported cough. Among patients who reported cough, 2214 (97. 4 %) remembered their cough duration. One thousand nine hundred and seventy three patients (89. 1 %) coughed for ³ 2 wks as compared to 241 (10. 9 %) patients who coughed for < 2 wks. Of those who coughed for two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> 250 (12. 7 %) had smear positive PTB, and of those who had coughed for less than two weeks, 21 (8. 7 %) had smear positive PTB. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of smear positive tuberculosis among the two groups (Pearson Chi-Square 3. 2; p = 0. 074). Conclusion: Detection of smear positive PTB among patients who coughed for less than two weeks was as high as for those who coughed for two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>more...</b>|$|R

The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used {{to keep track of the}} individual's sleep patterns.
