25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Though herbivorous {{to a greater}} degree than brown bears, and more {{carnivorous}} than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialised in their diet as pandas are: while pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the Aprilâ€“May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they will climb trees to eat bird cherries, pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the spawning season, though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. <b>Wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> prey can include muntjacs, serow, takin, wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.|$|E

The most spread zoonosis in Europe {{are the one}} caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia spp., Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp. Impact of global, climatic and social changes occurring {{in recent years has}} increased incidence of ticks and number of infected people and animals. This cause movement of ticks into higher altitudes and thus the emergence of new outbreaks. Our study from alpine region of northern Italy reveals an prevalence of four pathogens in I. ricinus ticks from different reservoir host such as <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates,</b> rodents, sheep, birds, dogs and humans. The highest prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was 14, 2 % and 10, 2 % for Rickettsia spp. in <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates,</b> 7, 1 % for Babesia spp. and 37, 5 % for Borrelia spp. in birds.

50|$|Prior to the {{resettlement}} of Maldharis, the Gir {{forest was}} heavily degraded {{and used by}} livestock, which competed with and restricted the population sizes of native ungulates.

50|$|In 1974, the Forest Department {{estimated}} the <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> population at 9,650 individuals. In the following decades, the <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> population has grown consistently to 31,490 in 1990 and 64,850 in 2010, including 52,490 spotted deer, 4,440 wild boar, 4,000 sambar, 2,890 blue bull, 740 chinkara, and 290 four-horned antelope. In contrast, populations of domestic buffalo and cattle declined following resettlement, {{largely due to}} direct removal of resident livestock from the Gir Conservation Area. The population of 24,250 domestic livestock in the 1970s declined to 12,500 in the mid-1980s, but increased to 23,440 animals in 2010. Following changes in both predator and prey communities, Asiatic lions shifted their predation patterns. Today, very few livestock kills occur within the sanctuary, and instead most occur in peripheral villages. In and around the Gir forest, depredation records indicate that lions killed on average 2,023 livestock annually between 2005 and 2009, and an additional 696 individuals in satellite areas.|$|E

50|$|Competition with {{domestic}} and wild ungulates {{also contributed to}} the extinction of the Pyrenean ibex. Much of its range was shared with sheep, domestic goats, cattle, and horses, especially in summer when it was in the high mountain pastures. This led to interspecific competition and overgrazing, which particularly affected the ibex in dry years. In addition, the introduction of non-native <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> species in areas occupied by the ibex (e.g. fallow deer and mouflon in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park) increased the grazing pressure, as well as the risk of transmission of both native and exotic diseases.|$|E

Another ungulate, which was present originally in the area is the kiang. Large predators are represented by snow leopard, wolf and brown bear. About 7,750 people with 70,000 domestic animals inhabit the reserve. The livestock has a strong impact on the reserves vegetation.|$|E
50|$|The Valparai {{range is}} also habitat to the Nilgiri tahr, an endemic <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate.</b> These {{mountain}} goats inhabit the high ranges and prefer open terrain, cliffs and grass-covered hills, a habitat largely confined to altitudes from 1200 to 2600m {{in the southern}} Western Ghats. Their territory extended far and wide all along these hills in the past, but, because of hunting and large-scale habitat destruction, they now exist only in a few isolated sites like the Anaimalai Hills. The human-elephant conflict here is a delicate issue. The tea plantations are a hindrance to the movement of wildlife, particularly elephants who walk large distances to reach water bodies and feeding areas.|$|E
50|$|Chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gaur (Bos gaurus), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), wild pig (Sus scrofa), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac) and chowsingha (Tetraceros quadricornis), are the <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> species {{found in}} the study area. Chital, sambar, nilgai and wild pigs are found all over the Tiger Reserve. With the {{distribution}} of water governing their movement patterns to a great extent, gaur migrate down from the hills {{during the dry season}} and occupy the forests along the Pench River and other sources of water, and migrate back to the hill forests during the monsoon. Nilgai are found mostly in a few open areas, along forest roads, scrub jungles and fringe areas of the Reserve. Chowsingha are more localized to the greatly undulating areas of the Reserve. Barking deer are seen infrequently in moist riverine stretches. Chinkara (Gazella bennetti) are infrequently seen on the open areas bordering and outside the Buffer Zone of the Reserve (e.g. Turia, Telia, and Dudhgaon).|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{domestic}} animals/wildlife interface {{is becoming}} a global issue of growing interest. However, despite studies on wildlife diseases being in expansion, the epidemiological role of wild animals in the transmission of infectious diseases remains unclear most of the time. Multiple diseases affecting livestock have already been identified in wildlife, especially in <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates.</b> The first objective {{of this paper was}} to establish a list of infections already reported in European <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates.</b> For each disease/infection, three additional materials develop examples already published, specifying the epidemiological role of the species as assigned by the authors. Furthermore, risk factors associated with interactions between wild and domestic animals and regarding emerging infectious diseases are summarized. Finally, the wildlife surveillance measures implemented in different European countries are presented.

40|$|Most {{emerging}} {{infectious diseases}} are zoonoses originating from wildlife among which vector-borne diseases constitute a major risk for global human health. Understanding the transmission routes of mosquito-borne pathogens in wildlife crucially depends on recording mosquito blood-feeding patterns. During an extensive longitudinal survey to study sylvatic anophelines in two wildlife reserves in Gabon, we collected 2, 415 mosquitoes of which only 0. 3 % were blood-fed. The molecular {{analysis of the}} blood meals contained in guts indicated that all the engorged mosquitoes fed on <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates.</b> This direct approach gave only limited insights into the trophic behavior of the captured mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed a complementary indirect approach that exploits the occurrence of natural infections by host-specific haemosporidian parasites to infer Anopheles trophic behavior. This method showed that 74 infected individuals carried parasites of great apes (58 %), ungulates (30 %), rodents (11 %) and bats (1 %). Accordingly, {{on the basis of}} haemosporidian host specificity, we could infer different feeding patterns. Some mosquito species had a restricted host range (An. nili only fed on rodents, whereas An. carnevalei, An. coustani, An. obscurus, and An. paludis only fed on <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates).</b> Other species had a wider host range (An. gabonensis could feed on rodents and <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates,</b> whereas An. moucheti and An. vinckei bit rodents, <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates</b> and great apes). An. marshallii was the species with the largest host range (rodents, <b>wild</b> <b>ungulates,</b> great apes, and bats). The indirect method substantially increased the information that could be extracted from the sample by providing details about host-feeding patterns of all the mosquito species collected (both fed and unfed). Molecular sequences of hematophagous arthropods and their parasites will be increasingly available in the future; exploitation of such data with the approach we propose here should provide key insights into the feeding patterns of vectors and the ecology of vector-borne diseases...|$|R
5000|$|Further, the {{population}} at the Mekong River may be particularly vulnerable to human exploitation because the ibisâ€™s use of both riverine and dryland forest in this region, thereby potentially exposing it to more human nest exploiters (various workers in the inland forest, and fishers on the river). This ibis may also be in potential competition with humans during amphibian and swamp eel harvesting during the dry season. Alongside direct habitat loss through land development, the white-shouldered ibisâ€™s habitat could also be threatened indirectly through modern agricultural mechanisation to replace traditional keeping of domestic ungulates that graze and trample on underlying vegetation and wallow in mud to maintain forest clearings and seasonal pools as important foraging ground for ibis. [...] The potentially adverse agricultural changes may be driven by the increasing profitability of mechanised farming. The hypothesis concerning the importance of ungulates to ibises in creating suitable habitats has been supported in exclosure experiments which show increased vegetation height and cover in exclosures fenced to bar ungulates compared to unfenced controls. Therefore, the marked decline of traditional farming livelihood practices potentially beneficial to white-shouldered ibis could lead to increased vegetation growth beside pools in clearings, and thereby render these sites unsuitable foraging ground for this ibis. This may be especially likely considering the local extinction or dramatic decline of many <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> species whose role in ibis habitat creation and maintenance has been largely taken over by human-reared ungulates with equivalent functions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> {{populations are}} {{increasing}} in Europe and Italy, with a consequent increase in culling rates {{and availability of}} their meats. Objectives of this review were to evaluate the trends of availability of meat from wild ungulates in Italy, to review the present knowledge on nutritional properties, sensorial characteristics, and hygiene problems of <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> meat and to examine the critical steps that influence their hygiene and quality. <b>Wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> meat in Italy derives mainly from wild boar, roe deer and red deer and its availability has been increasing in the last decade. Total consumption of <b>wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> meat is low (0. 1 - 0. 3 kg per capita/year), but in some regions rises to significant levels, especially for hunters' families (1. 0 - 4. 0 kg per capita/year). <b>Wild</b> <b>ungulate</b> meats generally have a low fat content, although with a certain variability associated with gender, hunting season, age and physiological conditions, and a favourable fatty acid composition. In general, they are darker, less tender and characterised by a more intense and peculiar flavour than meats from domestic ruminants.

40|$|Herbivory by both grazing and {{browsing}} ungulates {{shapes the}} structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, and both types of herbivory have been implicated in major ecosystem state changes.
