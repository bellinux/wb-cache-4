5|$|Blow {{stated that}} they had been in discussions with {{publishers}} for a physical release of the game, but opted to not do that step initially, citing the additional time that would have been needed for the manufacturing and distribution processes.

5|$|Graham was at {{the centre}} of {{development}} across platforms, and had no problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to the NES version. Routledge and Saunders {{came up with the}} method of multiplayer on the same device. Multiplayer via link-up was difficult to implement, with problems such as the game losing sync.|$|E
5|$|Jeopardy! {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} films, television shows and books over the years, mostly with one or more characters participating as contestants, or viewing and interacting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> show from their own homes.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce more realistic, dynamic interactions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain additional snow or fog (which reacts to Batman moving through it); with PhysX disabled, the effects are lessened or absent.|$|E

5000|$|Thew was {{disappointed}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> localization, calling it stiff and unnatural, {{and full of}} spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. He also found problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> tense, as it switches between present and past, and how the narration sometimes switches from Ritona's perspective to a [...] "detached, omniscient third person". Meanwhile, Barker thought that the translation was well done, and that the script was mostly free of errors; he did however find it to read awkwardly at times, with unnatural-sounding dialogue. Ethan thought that Sekai Project had {{done a good job}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game's</b> presentation, calling it a [...] "professional package".|$|R

5|$|With Hopkins {{backed up}} against her own goal line, Dashiell broke through the entire Navy team for a touchdown. Goal was missed and the score was 14 to 6 against Navy. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> fast coming to a close The Tars formed a closely knit ball with the halfback in center.|$|E
5|$|A book by {{the same}} name was written by Ray and Valerie Vallese and {{released}} by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. The book's plot follows the game's only loosely; for example, in the game, the main character's lack of a name {{is a sign of}} his incomplete state and a source of protection in being anonymous. In the book, the protagonist chooses a proper name. For the game's re-release on GOG.com a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> based on the game script by Chris Avellone and Colin McComb.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{detailed}} {{elements of the}} Myst universe Cyan created was the language {{and culture of the}} D'ni. The civilization's numbers and writing first appeared in Riven, and were important to solving some of the game's puzzles. The D'ni language was the language presented in various games and novels of the Myst franchise, created by Richard A. Watson. Several online D'ni dictionaries have been developed as part of the ongoing fan-based culture associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts. Reviewers highly praised its narrative, and some reviewers {{thought that it would}} work better as a short film, or an audio drama, rather than as a game.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross Music Selection is a mini-album of Chrono Cross {{music that}} was {{released}} in North America exclusively as a bonus for pre-ordering Chrono Cross. The five-track disc was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, has a length of 15:47 and was published by Square along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on August 15, 2000. Although {{the release of the}} album sparked rumors that it would be followed by a North American release of the full soundtrack album, Square Enix has not to date published Chrono Cross OST outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of}} the screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had less to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> itself and more with {{being a part of}} the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy IXs {{release was}} delayed {{to avoid a}} {{concurrent}} release with then rival Enix's Dragon Quest VII. On October 7, 2000, a demo day for the North American version of Final Fantasy IX {{was held at the}} Metreon in San Francisco, California. The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon; limited edition merchandise was included <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and fans cosplayed as Final Fantasy characters in celebration of the release. In Canada, a production error left copies of Final Fantasy IX without an English version of the instruction manual, prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later.|$|E

Halo went on to sell more than 4million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> development process.|$|E

Another form of {{entertainment}} in {{the area was}} baseball, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> first being played by 1860 and an early ballpark at Fourth and Ormsby emerging after the Civil War.
