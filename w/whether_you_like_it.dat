25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

Proposition 8 supporters released a commercial featuring Newsom saying the following words in a speech regarding same-sex marriage: [...] "This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not." [...] Some observers noted that polls shifted in favor of Proposition 8 following the release of the commercial; this, in turn, led to speculation that Newsom had {{played a role in the}} passage of the amendment.|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls was {{released}} on July 27, 1973, in the United States and on October 19 in the United Kingdom. Its controversial cover featured the band dressed in exaggerated drag, including high wigs, messy make-up, high heels, and garters. The photo was used for shock value, and {{on the back of}} the album, the band is photographed in their usual stage wear. To announce the album's release, Mercury published an advertisement slogan that read [...] "Introducing The New York Dolls: A Band You're Gonna Like, <b>Whether</b> <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Or Not", while other ads called them [...] "The Band You Love to Hate". Two double A-sided, 7" [...] singles were released—"Trash" [...] / [...] "Personality Crisis" [...] in July and [...] "Jet Boy" [...] / [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] in November 1973—neither of which charted.|$|E

[...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful".

Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic wrote about the lyrics, on the album review, that those are [...] "disturbing", {{but at the same}} time [...] "unintentionally hilarious." [...] She also criticized the production: [...] "There's not much to say about the kind of producer who thinks the use of the term 'shorty' with an elementary school gimmick is a good idea."

2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not, and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E
