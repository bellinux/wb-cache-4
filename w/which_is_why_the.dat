5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing Gods creates {{multiple}} faiths <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the anti-churches is one of division and strife.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Serralves Villa {{was subject}} to a {{restoration}} initiative by the architect, Álvaro Siza. With a total area of 900 square metres, 700 square metres are used as exhibition spaces, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> conservation intervention, in particular a restoration intervention, was necessary.|$|R
50|$|The Khampa Tibetans and Lhasa Tibetans {{held each}} other in mutual {{contempt}} and dislike, with the Khampa in some cases hating Lhasa rule even more than Chinese rule, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Khampa did little to resist Chinese forces as they entered Kham and subsequently took over the entire Tibet.|$|R

25|$|Most clay tablets that {{describe}} Babylonian mathematics {{belong to the}} Old Babylonian, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> mathematics of Mesopotamia {{is commonly known as}} Babylonian mathematics.

25|$|A {{change in}} design {{from that of}} the first three Formidables {{occurred}} in Bulwark and the other four Londons, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Londons often are considered a separate class. The main difference in the Bulwarks and the other four Londons from the first three ships was thinner deck armour and some other detail changes to the armour scheme.|$|E
50|$|One more mystery remained, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> LES had {{ignited the}} third stage on fire, {{something}} it {{was not supposed to}} do. The conclusion was that when the Soyuz descent module separated from the service module during the abort, it had inadvertently severed coolant lines in the service module, which then leaked out their highly flammable contents and started a fire when they were contacted by the LES exhaust.|$|R
60|$|They all {{called it}} Toupee {{because it was}} like one, but the name was {{forbidden}} in her father's hearing. Her father had decided that the proper name for a family dog in England is Towser, and did his utmost to suppress a sobriquet that was at once unprecedented {{and not in the}} best possible taste. <b>Which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> whole family, with the exception of Mrs. Pope, of course, stuck to Toupee....|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} time in which {{mainland}} Chinese airlines were allowed to fly <b>the</b> charters, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> mainland Chinese carriers were more zealous in preparing the flights. Airlines in Taiwan, however, thought that the preparing time was shorter than that of 2003. Moreover, many merchants had already bought tickets of flights which needed stopovers in Hong Kong or Macau. The Taiwanese airlines therefore postponed their launching date to that closer to New Year's Eve.|$|R
25|$|Two {{things must}} be noted about the locative case and its limited nature. First, it only exists as a case for masculines and neuters, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{corresponding}} feminine cell has been left blanked out. Rather, for marked feminine and unmarked nouns the locative is a postposition, which are explained on later in the article. Second, there is no distinction of gender.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{groundwater}} recharge assessments for Uganda, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> country's groundwater potential is unknown. Regional assessments in Ugandan towns, however, {{have indicated that}} {{groundwater recharge}} meets the current abstraction volumes. To monitor {{the quantity and quality}} of groundwater and surface water, the National Water Resources network has been established under the responsibility of the Water Resources Management Department.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{recruiting}} meetings {{were held in}} nearby townships including Allora, Sandy Creek, Maryvale, Yangan, Tannymorel and Killarney. These men either {{made their way to}} Warwick or joined the march at other towns along the route. All of the recruits' belongings were taken by train <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> route follows the Southern railway line to Toowoomba and down to Brisbane.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, {{questions}} were asked in Parliament by Manny Shinwell about the lack of use of the guns carried on Domala in her defence. Winston Churchill replied that the aircraft that attacked Domala had been initially misidentified as a friendly one, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> guns <b>were</b> not manned. A British destroyer also misidentified the aircraft. It <b>was</b> also asked <b>why</b> <b>the</b> gunners <b>were</b> not always manning the guns. In India, there was public anger towards Germany as {{a result of}} the attack. Eighty-one of those killed were Indian citizens.|$|R
25|$|Vita Ansgari and Gesta are {{sometimes}} ambiguous, {{which has caused}} some controversy as to whether Birca and the Björkö settlement were the same location. Many other locations have been suggested through the years. However, Björkö is the only location that can show remains of a town of Birca's significance, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of scholars regard Björkö as the location of Birca.|$|E
25|$|No equinox or {{solstice}} {{will ever}} {{be more than a}} day or so away from its mean date according to the solar calendar, while nineteen Jewish years average 6939d 16h 33m 03s compared to the 6939d 14h 26m 15s of nineteen mean tropical years. This discrepancy has mounted up to six days, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> earliest Passover currently falls on 26 March (as in AM 5773 / 2013 CE).|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} visualization can {{be integrated}} into a crystallographic database. Alternatively, the crystal structure data are exchanged between the database and the visualization software, preferably using the CIF format. Web-based crystallographic databases can integrate crystal structure visualization capability. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} structure, lighting, and 3D effects, crystal structure visualization can require a significant amount of processing power, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> actual visualization is typically run on the client.|$|E
50|$|In July 2013, on his {{way back}} to Bolivia from a visit in Russia, President Morales' plane was forced to land in Austria after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange leaked false {{information}} that whistleblower Edward Snowden was onboard President Morales airplane to Bolivia. Spain, France and Italy had denied for President Morales to fly in their airspace <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> President's airplane <b>was</b> forced to land in Austria. After a thorough search of the plane, it was concluded that Edward Snowden was not onboard.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft {{posted a}} comment on the support front page stating the issue is because 2008 is a leap year, and a {{firmware}} clock driver used by the Zune 30 improperly handled {{the last day of}} a leap year, causing the player to freeze. The driver was for a part used only in the Zune 30 model, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> bug didn't affect other Zune models. The official fix was to drain the device battery and then recharge after midday GMT on January 1, 2009.|$|R
50|$|Though {{there are}} several {{radioactive}} isotopes found {{at the site of}} the Chernobyl disaster, Caesium-137 is the most common (<b>which</b> may <b>be</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> killer chooses it to attack Ivanov and Timofeyev).|$|R
25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> sudden Antarctic ozone hole was such a surprise to many scientists.|$|E
25|$|The SM's six {{headlight}} set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. specification cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate glass windshields of the headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass windshields at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Unburned {{hydrocarbon}} (UHC) {{and carbon}} monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel {{that was not}} completely combusted, and UHCs are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel). Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> two types of emissions are heavily related. As {{a result of this}} close relation, a combustor that is well optimized for CO emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.|$|E
5000|$|The presenters {{have always}} been joined by a puppet known as Nev (Neville), who lives with Barney. Nev is a small, blue bear with patches in places and is missing part of his ear (Bandit losing to him in keepy uppy [...] ). Originally, the voice of Nev was prerecorded, and his limited {{vocabulary}} played in as appropriate, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> puppeteer Ross Mullan was recruited to provide the voice live. As a consequence, Nev's voice in the studio sounded distinctly different from that in the many phone-in games used on the programme.|$|R
5000|$|While {{attending}} the University of Tennessee, Holcomb met Ellie Bannister, daughter of producer-songwriter Brown Bannister. The two married in 2006 and {{now live in}} Nashville. Shortly after their wedding, Drew collaborated with Ellie as well as Nathan Dugger and Rich Brinsfield to form a band. At the time, they all {{lived in the same}} zip code, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> band <b>was</b> called [...] "Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors". In August 2008, the band released a 10-track album called Passenger Seat, which reached No. 3 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart.|$|R

25|$|The rampant {{inflation}} situation {{is considered a}} politically sensitive issue in Uzbekistan, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Uzbek government is slow to acclimate the currency to its current value by issuing higher coin and note denominations. As a result, the current highest coin denomination in circulation is the 500 soʻm while the highest banknote denomination is the 50,000 soʻm. Official state figures put inflation as {{of the first half}} of 2011 at 3.6%, however accurate numbers are pinned far higher. Coins and banknotes below 25 soʻm are practically worthless now.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between the A Ring and the F Ring has been named the Roche Division {{in honor of the}} French physicist Édouard Roche. The Roche Division {{should not be confused with}} the Roche limit which is the distance at which a large object is so close to a planet (such as Saturn) that the planet's tidal forces will pull it apart. Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.|$|E
25|$|Until 1963, a No {{ball was}} called when the bowler's back foot landed over the bowling crease (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> bowling crease was so called), exactly as in 1774. But {{it was felt}} that the tallest fast bowlers, able to bowl legally with their front foot well over the popping crease, were gaining too great an advantage. Bowlers also became skilled in {{dragging}} their back foot. The change in the Law led to an increase in No balls: in the 1962–63 series between Australia and England there were 5 No balls; in the series between the two teams three years later there were 25.|$|E
