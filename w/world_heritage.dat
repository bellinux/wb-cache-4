5|$|As of September 2017, Somalia has no {{official}} <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> sites since the Somali {{government is not}} party to the 1972 <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Convention.

5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> in Danger and the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> List. Of the two Former UNESCO <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> in Danger. Some sites have been designated as <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Sites and <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E

5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six <b>World</b> <b>Heritage</b> Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E

Ten years later, the Nansei Group of Islands (the Tokara, Amami and Ryukyu ISlands) were listed together with Shiretoko Peninsula (Hokkaido) and the Ogasawara Islands (Tokyo) as candidate sites for new <b>World</b> Natural <b>Heritage</b> listings.
