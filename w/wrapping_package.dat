40|$|The {{effects of}} {{packaging}} treatments, post harvest cooling delay and storage duration on color, texture, ascorbic acid content, {{weight loss and}} glucosinolate retention in crown-cut heads of broccoli were studied. Oxygen and CO 2 levels inside shrink <b>wrap</b> <b>packages</b> were also monitored. Shrink <b>wrap</b> <b>packaging</b> had a significant positive effect on hue angle (p 0. 05). Packaging and post harvest cooling delay {{had no effect on}} hue difference (H) and total color difference (E). While post harvest cooling delay had no effect on texture, crown-cut heads of broccoli stored in shrink <b>wrap</b> <b>packaging</b> retained firmness significantly better than ice packaged heads of broccoli (p 0. 05). Ascorbic acid was retained better in broccoli held in shrink <b>wrap</b> <b>packages</b> and cooling delay had a significant negative influence on ascorbic acid content (p 0. 05). Packaging and post harvest cooling delay had a significant positive effect on weight loss (p 0. 05). Broccoli stored in shrink wrap film lost about 3. 7 % of original weight while ice packaging resulted in about 17. 4 % weight loss (p 0. 05). No consistent trends were observed in the levels of O 2 and CO 2 inside shrink <b>wrap</b> <b>packages.</b> An important glucosinolate, glucoraphanin wa...|$|R

40|$|Background: Last {{generations of}} Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays allow to study copy-number {{variations}} {{in addition to}} genotyping measures. Results: MPAgenomics, standing for multi-patient analysis (MPA) of genomic markers, is an R-package devoted to: (i) efficient segmentation and (ii) selection of genomic markers from multi-patient copy number and SNP data profiles. It provides wrappers from commonly used packages to streamline their repeated (sometimes difficult) manipulation, offering an easy-to-use pipeline for beginners in R. The segmentation of successive multiple profiles (finding losses and gains) is performed with an automatic choice of parameters involved in the <b>wrapped</b> <b>packages.</b> Considering multiple profiles in the same time, MPAgenomicswraps efficient penalized regression methods to select relevant markers associated with a given outcome. Conclusions: MPAgenomics provides an easy tool to analyze data from SNP arrays in R. The R-package MPAgenomics is available on CRAN...|$|R

At 7 C Salmonella did not grow in either type of frankfurter; Staphylococcus and the natural spoilage flora sometimes grew more rapidly in the absence of nitrite, but the difference was not significant. At 20 C growth of Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and of the spoilage flora was, at most, only slightly faster on nitrite-free frankfurters. Salmonella was not suppressed in broth culture experiments at the pH and nitrite content found in frankfurters. Although either type of frankfurter can become hazardous due to growth of Salmonella or Staphylococcus, no unusual or additional hazard resulted from the omission of nitrite from frankfurters...|$|R

5000|$|Almost all New Order {{recordings}} bear minimalist packaging, art {{directed by}} Peter Saville. The group's record sleeves bucked the 1980s trend by rarely showing {{the band members}} (with {{the exception of the}} Low-Life album) or even providing basic information such as the band name or title of the release. Song names were often hidden within the shrink <b>wrapped</b> <b>package,</b> either on the disc itself (such as the [...] "Blue Monday" [...] single), on an inconspicuous part of an inner sleeve ("The Perfect Kiss" [...] single), or written in a cryptic colour code invented by Saville (Power, Corruption & Lies). Saville said his intention was to sell the band as a [...] "mass-produced secret" [...] of sorts, and that the minimalist style was enough to allow fans to identify the band's products without explicit labelling. Saville frequently sent the artwork straight to the printer, unreviewed by either the band or the label.|$|R
