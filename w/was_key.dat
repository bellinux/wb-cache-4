5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933. They created artificial lakes within Clark State Forest, and built many bridges, to aid in water conservation, provide beauty spots within the forest, and teach forestry skills {{to members of the}} Civilian Conservation Corps. The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot <b>was</b> <b>key</b> in the decision to focus so much attention on it.|$|E
5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee River. That year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{swing states}} of Ohio, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey and New York <b>were</b> <b>key</b> {{to the outcome}} of the 1888 election. Likewise, Illinois and Texas <b>were</b> <b>key</b> to {{the outcome of the}} 1960 election. Florida and New Hampshire <b>were</b> <b>key</b> to the 2000 election. Ohio <b>was</b> the <b>key</b> to the 2004 election. Ohio has gained a {{reputation}} as a swing state since the 1980s, and last voted against the winner in the 1960 election.|$|R

5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river <b>was</b> <b>key</b> {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The 1942–43 {{season was}} Bouchard's {{breakthrough}} year {{as he finished}} leading all Canadien defencemen in points and <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to the Canadiens' first season in several years without a losing record. They finished in fourth place {{with a record of}} 19 wins, 19 losses and 12 ties. Although they lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, the team was building in the right direction.|$|E

5|$|The NHL {{expanded}} in 1967, doubling from 6 teams to 12. Among the new entries was the Minnesota North Stars. The new team's coach and general manager, Wren Blair, had scouted Masterton while {{he played with}} the US Nationals and purchased his NHL playing rights from the Canadiens. Masterton was {{the first player to}} sign with Minnesota, agreeing to a two-year contract. He said {{prior to the start of}} the 1967–68 season that being able to play in Minnesota <b>was</b> <b>key</b> as he would have been unlikely to consider an offer with any other team.|$|E
5|$|The team's never-say-die attitude, {{instilled in}} {{previous}} seasons, <b>was</b> <b>key</b> {{to their success}} as the players often thrived in difficult situations. The highlight was United's dramatic comeback in the Champions League final, when Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored in injury time to overturn Bayern Munich's first-half lead. David Beckham was runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust <b>was</b> <b>key,</b> even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Philippe Leymarie, the French crushing of the Uprising {{resulted in}} the near annihilation of the managerial class in Madagascar, with consequences that continued to reverberate for decades after the country's independence. Many of the leading figures in the Uprising went on to dramatically shape {{the political and social}} landscape of Madagascar after independence. Monja Jaona, who was jailed by the French for nine years, founded the Madagascar for the Malagasy Party (MONIMA) in 1958 shortly after his release. His party <b>was</b> <b>key</b> in leading the rotaka peasant uprising against President Philibert Tsiranana which brought down his neo-colonial administration the following year. After initially supporting Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, Tsiranana's successor, in 1992 Jaona led demonstrations against it and in favor of federalism, being severely wounded in the process. His son, Monja Roindefo, is also an active member of MONIMA and served as Prime Minister under Andry Rajoelina.|$|E
5|$|After {{his second}} season in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Ellis was {{selected}} 11th overall by the Predators in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. During his junior career, he <b>was</b> <b>key</b> in guiding the Windsor Spitfires to back-to-back Memorial Cups as Canadian Hockey League (CHL) champions in 2009 and 2010. Individually, he {{was named to the}} CHL and OHL All-Rookie Teams in 2008, the First OHL All-Star Team in 2009 and 2011 and the Second OHL All-Star Team in 2010. He was awarded the OHL's Bobby Smith Trophy as the League's scholastic player of the year in 2008, the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the top defenceman in 2009 and 2011 and the Red Tilson Trophy as the most outstanding player in 2011. On a national basis, he was named CHL Defenceman and Player of the Year in 2011. Serving as the Spitfires' team captain in 2010–11, he became the franchise's all-time leading point-scorer among defencemen.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Basil II {{advanced}} towards Strumitsa, which <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to {{holding the}} whole Vardar valley. On {{their way to}} the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.|$|E

5|$|At Pixar's story {{development}} department, Purcell contributed screenplay {{material and}} voice {{work for the}} 2006 film Cars, and designed {{the character of the}} Screaming Banshee in the short Mater and the Ghostlight. Providing scripts and voice work for three games based on Cars, Purcell became involved with THQ's video game adaptations of Pixar films. Purcell was credited for involvement with Pixar's 2007 film Ratatouille; he provided the voice for the character of Carl in George & A.J.—a 2009 short based on the film Up. Purcell <b>was</b> <b>key</b> for Pixar's 2012 film Brave, co-directing the film alongside Brenda Chapman and Mark Andrews in addition to providing work for the screenplay; Brave constituted Purcell's biggest role in a Pixar project to date.|$|E
5|$|Bradford were {{expected}} to struggle in their first season in the top flight for 77 years. Jewell signed David Wetherall, Dean Saunders and Neil Redfearn, all experienced top flight performers, but City were in the bottom four teams {{for most of the}} season. It was Bradford's home form – they earned 26 of their 36 points at Valley Parade – that <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to City avoiding relegation, which was narrowly averted by two points after a shock 1–0 final day victory over Liverpool in 1999–2000, sending Wimbledon down instead. When Jewell left only days after the season ended, McCall was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings, and subsequently served as caretaker manager for two games when Hutchings was sacked after just 12 games of the 2000–01 league season. City were relegated with just 26 points. During a 6–1 defeat to West Yorkshire rivals Leeds United in the penultimate game, McCall and team-mate Andy Myers fought on the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{threw himself}} into the role, {{travelling}} {{around the country and}} inspecting local units to gain an overall idea of their efficiency. Even under favourable circumstances, however, he found that only 54% of the volunteers attended parades in 1906; at the annual camps, the proportion was as low as 45%. He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt <b>was</b> <b>key</b> for a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers. By the end of his second year in office, he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers, and a central promotion board for senior field officers, as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, an {{expedition}} by Ivar Tollefsen {{made the first}} ascents of several mountains, including the tallest, Jøkulkyrkja. Norway established the summer station Troll in 1989–90. In 2003, Minister of the Environment Børge Brende was the first Norwegian minister to visit Queen Maud Land, and he soon allocated funds to expand the Troll station. Troll was upgraded to a year-round station in 2005 {{as part of the}} centenary of Norway's independence. Among the guests were Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen and Minister of the Environment Knut Arild Hareide, and Troll was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway, the first queen to ever visit Antarctica. In 2008, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, accompanied by forty officials, scientists and reporters, became the first Norwegian prime minister to visit Queen Maud Land. He personally named three mountains around the Troll station where he was based, although he chose to sleep outdoors in a tent, rather than in a bed inside. He said the purposes of the visit were to claim Norway's possessions in Antarctica, as well as {{to learn more about the}} climate research at Troll, which he said <b>was</b> <b>key</b> to better understanding of global climate change.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to {{the founding of the}} MDRM, which many non-Merina feared would revive Merina political hegemony, the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed in June 1946 by members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Militant leader Mahasampo Raveloson <b>was</b> <b>key</b> {{in the creation of the}} party. Other founding members included Philibert Tsiranana (who became Madagascar's first president after independence), Albert Sylla (who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under Tsiranana, and whose son, Jacques Sylla, would go on to become Prime Minister of Madagascar under Marc Ravalomanana), and Pascale Velonjara, father-in-law of future president Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
