With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Briskin had gained a {{reputation}} of being a very thrifty producer. However, he was also known for putting {{the quality of the}} product over saving money. Joseph Walker, the cinematographer for the 1931 film Dirigible, directed by Frank Capra, explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps, which would have been much less expensive: , the studio's general manager, who personally supervised the making of the picture, and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar's worth of production for every dollar spent than any other executive in the business, was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> to see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made [...] "merely adequate". Therefore he spared no expense in assuring absolute authenticity in every detail of the production.|$|E

[...] The professors who were already teaching Pedro II and his sisters under José Bonifácio were retained by the new guardian. The exception was Friar Pedro de Santa Mariana who was nominated to occupy the place of aio (supervisor) formerly held by Friar Antonio de Arrábida (who had tutored Pedro I as a child). General supervision of Pedro II's education fell to Friar Pedro Mariana, and he took personal charge of his Latin, religion and mathematics studies. He {{was one of the few}} people outside his family for whom Pedro II held great affection.|$|E

He remarked, [...] "I know Xuande (Liu Bei) is not capable of doing this. He must be following somebody's advice." [...] The historian Pei Songzhi commented that Cao Cao made that remark – which suggests that Liu Bei was not <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> to notice Hanzhong's strategic importance – because of his personal disdain for Liu, and {{that it should not}} be taken seriously. He felt that a lord acting on his adviser's suggestion should not be interpreted as a sign that the lord was not <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> to make his own judgment. He pointed out that Cao Cao himself also followed the advice of his adviser Guo Jia.|$|E

60|$|The ducats Duke Ernest got for his {{soldiers}} {{he spent in}} a series of the most brilliant entertainments. Nevertheless, the jovial prince was economical, and kept a steady eye upon his own interests. He achieved the electoral dignity for himself: he married his eldest son George to his beautiful cousin of Zell; and sending his sons out in command of armies to fight—now on this side, now on that—he lived on, taking his pleasure, and scheming his schemes, a merry, <b>wise</b> prince <b>enough,</b> not, I fear, a moral prince, of which kind we shall have but very few specimens in the course of these lectures.|$|R
6000|$|As {{a result}} of these {{conflicting}} interests and the local or [...] sectional passions which they aroused, there was seldom a year [...] after 1840 when the country did not face a situation of extreme [...] difficulty or danger.

50|$|Cangrande I della Scala {{appears in}} the seventh tale {{of the first day}} of Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron.

2500|$|The Allegory of the Cave (often said by {{scholars}} to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that {{only people who}} have {{climbed out of the}} cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the [...] "philosopher-king", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> to choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the Republic, that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.|$|E

[...] In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the Hartford Courant, citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from Port Chester, New York. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt denied the identification to the Courant saying [...] "No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?" [...] Bernstein said his son didn't know.

2500|$|The great {{period of}} Beauvais {{tapestry}} {{begins with the}} arrival of Jean-Baptiste Oudry, 22 July 1726, replacing the unsatisfactory Jacques Duplessis. When Mérou was dismissed in 1734 for falsifying the accounts, {{for the first time the}} manufacture was directed by an artist, since Oudry's financial backer, Nicolas Besnier, a goldsmith of Paris, was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not to interfere with the artistic production, and the partnership lasted until 1753. Oudry was simultaneously inspector of the works at Gobelins. At Beauvais he reorganized the training of the young workers and turned out designs and constantly renewed borders: the New Hunts, the suite of Country Pleasures, the hangings illustrating Molière's comedies, a renewed suite of perennially popular Metamorphoses. Sets of tapestry covers for seat furniture were introduced, and in September 1737 it was decided that the King of France should purchase two sets of tapestry each year, for 10,000 livres, for gifts to foreign ministers, an advertisement of French hegemony in the field of art and also a fine advertisement for the quality of the Beauvais manufacture. The king had the entire production of Gobelins at his disposal, but as Edith Standen points out, they were rather large, rather solemn and definitely old-fashioned. [...] In 1739, for the first time, [...] cartoons for Beauvais were exhibited at the Paris salon, another way of keeping the tapestry workshops before the public eye.|$|E
