60|$|Oliver roused himself, {{and made}} his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with {{his eyes fixed on}} the magistrates' powder, whether all boards were born with that <b>white</b> <b>stuff</b> on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.|$|E

6000|$|... "The Naturalist Tavern" [...] {{was not a}} {{meaningless}} name; for all the halls and all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled {{with all sorts of}} birds and animals, glass-eyed, ably stuffed, and set up in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes. The moment we were abed, the rain cleared away and the moon came out. I dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great <b>white</b> <b>stuffed</b> owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who thought he had met me before, but could not make out for certain.|$|R

60|$|In front stood a great courtyard. Behind, also {{surrounded}} by a high wall, was the garden. As this was always devoted to the zenana, they had {{little doubt that the}} rooms of the ladies were on this side; and, two hours later, they were delighted at seeing a small piece of <b>white</b> <b>stuff,</b> thrust through one of the lattices. The woman had been faithful to her trust. Ada had received the letter.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless she {{was almost}} frightened to advance, for the big dark shadow right across the stuccoed wall awed her by its mysterious blackness.

50|$|A book (<b>Stuff</b> <b>White</b> People Like: A Definitive Guide to the Unique Taste of Millions) was {{released}} on July 1, 2008.

60|$|Some {{few paces}} from her, at the further {{end of the}} room, a young girl sat on an {{elevated}} platform, with shoulders bare and head straight and rigid, {{the model for the}} proposed statue.

60|$|That was a little, darkish room too, {{but it was}} {{smothered in}} white lace. The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard, and was drawing thread from a vast web of lace.

Threads of curly cotton, pulled out from between the lengths of lace, strewed over the fender and the fireplace. Paul dared not go forward, for fear of treading on piles of <b>white</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Another famous {{visitor to}} Hirschhorn was Mark Twain. He {{travelled}} from Heilbronn to Hirschhorn by boat, stayed overnight {{at the hotel}} [...] "Zum Naturalisten" [...] on August 9, 1878, and continued his journey to Heidelberg by coach and train.

[...] "I dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great <b>white</b> <b>stuffed</b> owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with {{the air of a}} person who thought he had met me before but could not make out for certain." [...] This same owl can still be seen at Langbein Museum today. Twain's description of Hirschhorn is still as true as it was in 1878: [...] "...Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance, down the river. Then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old battlemented stone wall stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye." ...|$|R

6000|$|After that I hid {{myself as}} well as I could behind a chair, for I was shy, and watched little Stella Carson, who was the squire's only child, giving the {{children}} presents off the tree. She was dressed as Father Christmas, with some soft <b>white</b> <b>stuff</b> round her lovely little face, and she had large dark eyes, which I thought more beautiful than anything I had ever seen. At last it came to my turn to receive a present--oddly enough, considered {{in the light of}} future events, it was a large monkey. Stella reached it down from one of the lower boughs of the tree and handed it to me, saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was at the}} Gould and Curry mine, {{the other}} day, and they had two or three tons of choice rock piled up, which was valued at $20,000 a ton.

If you don't know what the <b>white</b> <b>stuff</b> on it is, I must inform {{you that it is}} purer silver than the minted coin.

I spent a whole day in prowling round and round the jail, but sorra an idea came into my thick head, though I bate it wid my fists till it was sore; for, says I to myself, there is no lock so strong but it can be picked, if you do but know the right way. It was the second day, when I espied a little bit of <b>white</b> <b>stuff</b> at one of the windows.

I can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and {{medium-sized}} cyclones, but this here fuzzy <b>white</b> <b>stuff</b> naturally gets me all locoed. I reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much. It's like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on, and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock, waving an ostrich-feather fan, and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers. Wouldn't it make you look for your pocket compass? You'd be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nothing {{was more}} common, in the seances of Home, the [...] "Medium," [...] than the {{appearance}} of [...] "Spirit hands".
