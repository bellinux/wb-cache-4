40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the structure of vocational interests as reflected in interest in ventories, with a view to examining whether vocational interests could be assessed in correspondence with the perception of <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics. Two types of questionnaires on vocational interests were administered to male and female college students. The first consisted of 30 items assessing the interests in <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics such as objects of activities and activity functions. The second consisted of 50 items assessing the interests in various. job groups. Replies were collected from 922 students. The principal component analysis of the replies from the respondents revealed eight factors as to <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics. They included four factors relating to the objects of activities (things / mechanical, specified people, unspecified people and information) and two factors relating to <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> functions (mental and physical). The configuration of these <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics factors in two-dimensional space was compatible with Prediger's two-dimensional map (with axes, people / things and data / ideas) for the female samples but not for the male samples. Regarding interests on job groups, 10 factors could be extracted including production / construction, professional / technological, sales / service and others. The results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that these perceived <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics contributed significantly to forming the respondents' interests in different job groups...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} refractive error to environmental factors, including close up work, in Singapore military conscripts.  METHODS—A cross sectional study was conducted on 429  Singapore military conscripts. Non-cycloplegic refraction and A-scan biometry were performed in both eyes. A detailed questionnaire was administered by in-person interview to obtain information about current and past near <b>work</b> <b>activity,</b> extra tuition lessons, educational experiences, and family demographics.  RESULTS—Myopia associated with the conscript having been educated in the (gifted, special, or express) educational streams (adjusted odds ratio (OR)  =  3. 8,  95 % confidence interval CI 2. 0 - 7. 3), and having completed pre-university education (OR= 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 8. 8). The reported close up <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> at age 7  years did correlate with age of onset of myopia (p< 0. 001). In parallel, supplemental tuition lessons in primary school has (OR= 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 4. 9) associated with conscript myopia. Parental myopia was positively associated with myopia (p< 0. 001), but this relation disappeared when adjusted for environmental factors. Current (p= 0. 83) and past close up <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> at age 7  years (p= 0. 13) did not correlate with myopia.  CONCLUSION—Educational level and educational stream positively related to myopia. A relation was observed with reported close up <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> in early childhood and with tuition classes during elementary school, but not with current close up <b>work</b> <b>activity.</b> These results underscore the strong influence of environment in myopia pathogenesis but a role for close up <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> remains indeterminate. ...|$|R

In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major <b>work</b> <b>activities,</b> with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) during this demanding period.|$|E
