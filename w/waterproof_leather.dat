5000|$|After the {{retirement}} of his uncle in 1870, and after five years [...] "learning the ropes", W.G. Hoople became a partner and managed Van Nostrand & Hoople, until his uncle's death on 17 June 1895. As a reward for his stewardship, W.G. Hoople received a sizable inheritance of $55,000 in real estate from his uncle. The success of his various business enterprises resulted in William G. Hoople becoming a multi-millionaire. In 1870 Hoople, in partnership with Edward Everett Androvette, established Hoople & Androvette, dealers in tanning materials and dyes, at 250 Front Street, New York city, a five-story building that they purchased in September 1902. Also in 1870 W.G. Hoople and Loring Andrew Robertson (born November 12, 1828 in Windham, New York; died October 9, 1890 in New York) formed Robertson & Hoople, which traded as a leather merchant. On January 3, 1884 W.G. Hoople and Robertson incorporated the New York Leather Belting Company which manufactured oak-tanned leather belting, <b>waterproof</b> <b>leather</b> halting, and electric belts at its factory {{at the corner of}} South Eleventh Street and Kent Avenue, Brooklyn. Additionally, W.G. Hoople had established Hoople & Nichols, in partnership with William S. Nichols (born February 1845 in Rhode Island; died September 25, 1892), whose son, Albert I. Nichols, later became his partner in the firm, and also married his youngest daughter, Bessie. This firm imported shellac, but later expanded to become a hardware store, selling brushes. WG Hoople was also involved in real estate investments. In September 1893 WG Hoople purchased four multi-story buildings at Peck Slip and Pearl Street, Manhattan that were under foreclosure, while in August 1897 he sold a four-story brownstone-front building near the infamous Five Points at 32 Great Jones Street for $27,000, and in 1899 he sold the building that housed his offices at 38 Ferry Street, New York, to philanthropist businessman Charles Adolph Schieren (born February 28, 1842 in Germany; died March 15, 1915), the penultimate mayor of Brooklyn (1894-1895). WG Hoople was also a director of the Hide and Leather Bank that had been established on June 15, 1891 and was headquartered in a ten-story building at 88-90 Gold Street.

5000|$|Although {{there were}} various plans for submersibles or {{submarines}} during the Middle Ages, the Englishman William Bourne designed {{one of the}} first prototype submarines in 1578. This was to be a completely enclosed boat that could be submerged and rowed beneath the surface. Comprising a completely enclosed wooden vessel sheathed in <b>waterproofed</b> <b>leather,</b> it was to be submerged by using hand operated wooden screw thread adjustable plungers pressing against flexible leather bags located at the sides in order to increase or decrease the volume of water to adjust the buoyancy of the craft. The sketch (left) suggests that the depth adjustment was by means of a crankset projecting above the surface. There is no obvious accommodation for crew. The first submersible to be actually built in modern times was constructed in 1605 by Magnus Pegelius. Its fate was to become buried in mud. In 1596 the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions the following: [...] "These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers, other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform."It's unclear whether or not Napier ever carried out his plans. Henry Briggs, who was professor of mathematics at Gresham College, London, and later at Oxford, was a friend of Napier, whom he visited in 1615 and 1616, and was also an acquaintance of Cornelius Jacobszoon Drebbel, a Dutchman in the service of James I of England, who designed and built the first successful submarine in 1620. Hence, it is not impossible that {{it was because of the}} interest taken by Napier in the submarine that Briggs came in touch with Drebbel.Drebbel's submarine was propelled by oars and is thought to have incorporated floats with tubes to allow air down to the rowers. The precise nature of this submarine is unclear, it may be possible that it resembled a bell towed by a boat. Two improved types were tested in the River Thames between 1620 and 1624. Of one of these tests Constantijn Huygens reports in his autobiography of 1651 the following: ...|$|R

5000|$|Chestnut wood is {{a useful}} source of natural tannin and was used for tanning leather before the {{introduction}} of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark colour to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content, which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; {{so it was not}} employed in this use. Chestnut tannin is obtained by hot-water extraction of chipped wood. It is an ellagic tannin and its main constituents are identified by castalagin (14.2%) and vescalagin (16.2%).It has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content, and high acids content. This determines its astringency and its capability to fix raw hides. These properties make chestnut extract especially suitable for the tanning of heavy hides and to produce leather soles for high-quality shoes in particular. It is possible to obtain a leather with high yield in weight, which is compact, firm, flexible, and <b>waterproof.</b> Chestnut-tanned <b>leathers</b> are elastic, lightfast, resistant to traction and abrasion, and have warm colour.Chestnut tannin is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins (also known as hydrolysable tannin). As it tends to give a brownish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and valonia. [...] The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin than chestnut trees in northern climates.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} surface-active substances with acute toxic effects after inhalation by using isolated perfused rat lungs, to allow acute inhalation studies to be avoided in the future according to the " 3 Rs" concept defined by Russel and Burch. The testing of consumer sprays in isolated lungs for potentially toxic effects after inhalation was restricted to the surface-active agents in waterproofing sprays. The tests included "Magic Nano", a waterproofing spray for tiles, ceramics and glass which was removed from the market in 2006 after incidences of poisoning had been reported, and nine different samples of shoe and <b>leather</b> <b>waterproofing</b> sprays. To assess the potential lung toxicity of each substance tested, changes in several respiratory parameters, edema and atelectasis formation, and the administered doses were evaluated. Pulmonary edema after inhalation exposure to "Magic Nano", as previously observed in epidemiological contexts and in experimental animals, was also observed in 75 % of the examined lungs. The tidal volume and compliance of these lungs were significantly decreased in comparison with control lungs. With three of the nine test samples of shoe and <b>leather</b> <b>waterproofing</b> agents no significant differences from the controls were found for the respiratory parameters analyzed. Macroscopically, there was also no indication of edema or atelectasis formation. In contrast, with the other six test samples, significant differences were found regarding changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance. Furthermore, there were macroscopic changes ranging from partially collapsed lung areas to complete atelectasis of the entire lung, depending on the test substance. For all waterproofing agents tested, the percent change in respiratory parameters was calculated in relation to the amount of active substance inhaled by the lung. The obtained values were then assessed based upon a threshold value for this change which was determined as part of this study. Depending on whether the value was above or below the defined threshold, the substances were assigned to different categories. Category 1 is for substances which do not show any acute harmful effects on the isolated perfused lung. Three substances could be assigned to this category. For these substances, corroborating tests according to OECD TG 403 need to be performed. The other substances tested were assigned to category 2, because their values exceeded the threshold limit. For these compounds, acute inhalation toxicity testing in animals is not recommended. Comparison of the obtained results with corresponding animal experimental studies showed that investigations in the isolated rat lung allowed the identification of surface-active substances that lead to harmful effects on the lungs. After refinement and validation of this method, it should be possible to use isolated perfused lungs to screen for substances that are acutely toxic after inhalation exposure...|$|R
