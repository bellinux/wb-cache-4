5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1881, a {{light engine}} and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the mouth}} of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error.

One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> at no other London terminus.|$|E

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
5|$|Brodeur topped {{another of}} Roy's {{previous}} marks on November 27, as {{he set the}} record for the most minutes played in the NHL, which had been 60,235.

He also set the mark for the most regular-season shutouts with a 4–0 win against the Penguins on December 21, breaking Sawchuk's record of 103. On December 30, 2009, Brodeur and the Devils shut out the Penguins, 2–0. It was his 105th career shutout, giving him the all-time professional record, surpassing George Hainsworth's total of 104 combined in the NHL (94) and Western Canada Hockey League (10). On April 6, 2010, Brodeur reached his 600th career win by defeating the Thrashers 3–0. This was also his 110th career shutout.|$|E

5|$|In the 1975–76 season, {{a rookie}} Alvan Adams helped the team reach its first NBA Finals, which {{they lost to}} the Boston Celtics 4—2. Charles Barkley and Steve Nash won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award while playing for the Suns. Barkley led the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Bulls. After signing with the Suns in 2004, Nash led the team to three {{straight}} division titles, but after reaching the Conference Finals in 2009–10 the Suns have subsequently experienced their worst period of on-court failure, missing the playoffs for 7 straight seasons (the franchise's previous record playoff drought was 5 seasons, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> after the team made the postseason in only their second year of existence during the 1969-70 campaign).|$|E
5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first {{understood}} its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though {{they were interested in}} making bigger games outside the Flash market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on Flash (through Kongregate) and iOS simultaneously, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before any}} {{construction}} work {{had started the}} cost of the forts had been estimated to exceed the previous calculations by fifty percent. In December 1901, only few months after the first blasting work that had been done at Gammelängsberget in July 1901, the cost for the four forts northeast of the river was expected to be sixty-five percent more expensive than the initial calculation. The blueprints of the forts at Degerberget, Gammelängsberget and Södra Åberget were the first to be confirmed, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> on 11 May 1901. The fort at Mjösjöberget followed suit on 3 April 1902 and the last fort to get a confirmed blueprint was the fort at Rödberget, on 19 May 1903. The last proposed fort, at Paglaberget, was deleted from the plans in 1906along with the batteries at Fällberget and Slumpberget as well as the fortifications at Avan and Svartbyträsketbefore any work on the fort had started, due to the proposal of the new Fortification Committee of 1905, which was formed following the reports of the large rise in costs. On 9 February 1906, the current Minister for War Lars Tingsten calculated the total cost to end at 19,220,000 kronor, more than twice the cost reported by the 1897 committee.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E

The New York Knicks have selected nine former Tar Heels, which is the most of any current NBA franchise. Forty-nine Tar Heels have been drafted in the first round of the NBA Draft, with Tony Bradley, Jr. and Justin Jackson being the latest. The most Tar Heels selected in the first round of a single NBA Draft is four, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> twice, in 2005 and 2012. Sixteen players have been selected to either an ABA or NBA All-Star Game, sixteen have been a member of an NBA or ABA championship winning team, and nine have achieved both.

5|$|Trinidad and Tobago is a two-island {{nation in}} the Caribbean Sea that lies close to South America. The nation has participated in the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and has {{appeared}} at every Summer Olympics since then {{with the exception of}} the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, when it joined Jamaica and Barbados in a political union called the West Indies Federation. Overall, Trinidad and Tobago had participated in eighteen Olympic games (15 Summer Olympics and 3 Winter Olympics) between its 1948 debut and its appearance at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and its fifteenth Olympic game since its independence, which was in 1962. The Trinidadian delegation in Beijing comprised its largest delegation by far, with 28 athletes. The previous record included 19 athletes, <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> in 1968, 1972, 2000 and 2004. Between 1948 and 2008, Trinidad and Tobago accumulated 14 medals (one gold, five silver and eight bronze); two of those medals were won in Beijing (a silver in the men's 100meters another in the men's 4x100meters relay). Richard Thompson, a male track athlete, medaled in the men's 100meters but also medaled as a member of the Trinidadian relay team. All Olympians participating in Beijing for Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception of Dexter St. Louis in table tennis, were planning as of the end of the Beijing Olympics to continue training for future Olympic games.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident <b>which</b> <b>happened</b> in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
