25|$|During {{the early}} part of Adrian Lewis' career until 2007, he was Taylor's protégé having practised {{together}} in their home city Stoke-on-Trent and made his television debut in 2004, aged 19, at the UK Open. However, Lewis has kicked on since then and has amassed four PDC major titles including two consecutive World titles in 2011 and 2012. The pair have been part of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> feisty rivalry at times. For instance, in their semi-final meeting at the 2010 World Grand Prix, Taylor accused Lewis of playing up to the crowd to put him off. Lewis would win that encounter five sets to four. Lewis and Taylor have met in four PDC major finals during their rivalry. These have included the finals of the 2008 and 2011 European Championship which Taylor won 11–5 and 11–8 respectively, the final of the 2013 Masters which Taylor won 10–1, as well as the final of the 2013 World Matchplay where Taylor averaged 111.23 and won 18–13. The latter involved Lewis playing in his first Matchplay final where he averaged 105.92 and hit 19 maximums. Taylor has played Lewis 70 times, winning 52 and losing 16, with 2 draws.|$|E

[...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|Alonso Duralde of TheWrap {{wrote that}} the film is [...] "the best {{animated}} musical {{to come out of}} Disney since the tragic death of lyricist Howard Ashman, whose work on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast helped build the studio's modern animated division into what it is today." [...] He also said that [...] "while it lags the tiniest bit {{on its way to the}} conclusion, the script... really delivers; it offers characters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter observed Frozen as a true musical and wrote, [...] "You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become while watching Disney's 3D animated princess tale." [...] McCarthy described the film as [...] "energetic, humorous and not too cloying, as well as the first Hollywood film in many years to warn of global cooling rather than warming, this tuneful toon upgrades <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> lackluster year for big studio animated fare and, beginning with its Thanksgiving opening, should live up to box office expectations as one of the studio's hoped-for holiday-spanning blockbusters." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised the film as [...] "a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-style songs and a crafty plot. Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle, but this is the rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as a Pixar film." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote, [...] "Frozen is both a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of Disney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity. It's also a just plain terrific bit of family entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reaction from}} newspaper critics. In the Liverpool Echo, Rachael Tinniswood {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "was a fantastic display of everything that has made Cold Feet such a popular drama {{over the past few}} years" [...] and that Kimberley Joseph had proved to be [...] "a more than adequate replacement" [...] for Fay Ripley {{over the course of the}} fourth series. Tony Purnell wrote in the Daily Mirror that [...] "The fact that the gang ended up in Australia showed just how much the series had lost its way." [...] Graham Young in the Birmingham Mail wrote that the excursion to Sydney [...] "smacks more of giving the cast a treat after four years, rather than any real necessity of the script". The Daily Records critic wrote [...] "if this is the last-ever episode, we should make the most of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> relatively disappointing series". In a column about Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the episode—"which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot"—of being the point the series jumped the shark. Times columnist Caitlin Moran described it as [...] "both draining and tensifying". Moran went on to say that Adam and Rachel had become poorly characterised and suggested that Mike Bullen had come to loathe the characters. The episode was selected as a [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sun and The Sunday Times. Writing in the Journal of British Cinema and Television in 2006, Greg M. Smith analysed the development of the David character over the course of Series 4, including the fantasy scene in this episode where David imagines living with Karen in Australia, and the scene where David and Karen take off their wedding rings: [...] "Old, exhausted love is traded for new, vibrant love in this single gesture. Karen pursues David as he storms off after the ceremony, shouting his name, undoubtedly ready to alternate once more between pain and partial forgiveness, as they have done throughout their marriage. David turns and says: 'No, Karen. No more'." [...] Smith also compared the scene to the wedding scene in the film The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946).|$|E

500|$|Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times praised Michael Giacchino's musical score, {{writing that}} [...] "I'm {{reminded}} of the heights of emotion this series can evoke." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post thought that the finale's split and two-week break was [...] "not cool", but asked [...] "how brilliant was Sun's smackdown on her bad daddy?". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. [...] I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, {{a lot of it}} was set-up for … [...] ), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as far as I was concerned." [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post [...] "really liked this episode" [...] and concluded that it [...] "definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show." ...|$|E

Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it. Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes. Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed. Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go {{was not a good}} game, it was [...] "a great experience". The server problems also received negative press. Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game's strong social appeal and visual design, the game's [...] "initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems. Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the [...] "three-step glitch", reviewers also gave this bug negative press.

Not the least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events.

Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out {{of the range of}} ordinary expectation.
