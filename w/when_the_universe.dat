5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation.

5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> {{was less than a}} billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E
5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.|$|E

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> early <b>universe</b> {{was about}} 47,000 years old (redshift 3600), mass-energy density surpassed the {{radiation}} energy, although <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> remained optically thick to radiation until <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was about 378,000 years old (redshift 1100).

5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized {{to account for the}} asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E

25|$|According to the Big Bang theory, in {{the early}} {{universe}} at high temperatures <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was only a few tens of microseconds old, the phase of matter took the form of a hot phase of quark matter called the quark–gluon plasma (QGP).|$|E
25|$|The {{infrared}} light {{that we now}} observe from the galaxy was emitted as ultraviolet radiation {{toward the end of}} an era <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was filled with atomic hydrogen, which absorbed at ultraviolet wavelengths.

25|$|As the {{universe}} expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the energy {{density of the}} plasma to decrease until it became favorable for electrons to combine with protons, forming hydrogen atoms. This recombination event happened when the temperature was around 3000K or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was approximately 379,000years old. As photons did not interact with these electrically neutral atoms, the former began to travel freely through space, resulting in the decoupling of matter and radiation.|$|E

25|$|The VLT has {{observed}} the afterglow of the farthest known gamma-ray burst.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} in forming a supermassive black hole {{resides in the}} need for enough matter {{to be in a}} small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order for this to happen. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.|$|E

25|$|According to Kaplan the Sabbatical cycles in Sefer HaTemunah {{can be used}} as a {{basis for}} calculating the age of the universe.

25|$|Antiparticles {{are also}} {{produced}} in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy {{greater than the}} pair production threshold).

The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called baryon asymmetry. The exact mechanism which produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem. One of the necessary conditions for this asymmetry is the violation of CP symmetry, which has been experimentally observed in the weak interaction.|$|E

40|$|Inflationary cosmological {{theories}} predict, {{and some}} more general aesthetic criteria suggest, that the large-scale spatial curvature of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> k should be accurately zero (i. e., flat), a condition which is satisfied <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe's</b> present mean density {{and the value}} of the cosmological constant Lambda have certain pairs of values.

In particular, if the mean density of <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is as small as the baryon density inferred from standard cosmic nucleosynthesis calculations or as determined from typical dynamical studies of galaxies and galaxy clusters, then a value of Lambda large enough to produce a k = 0 universe would result in a substantially higher frequency of multiple-image lensing of quasars than has been observed so far. Shortcomings of the available lens data and uncertainties concerning galaxy properties allow some possibility of escaping this conclusion, but systematic searches for a gravitational lenses and continuing investigations of galaxy mass distributions should soon provide decisive information.
