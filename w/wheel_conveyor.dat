40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to investigating the factor that effect repair and maintenance cost of combine harvester. Combine harvester is use to overcome shortage of manpower in agriculture sector. Repair and maintenance cost is the main factor in order to select a new or second hand combine harvester because the capacity or age of the machine may increase the cost of repair and maintenance. Common model of combine harvester that is mainly use in Malaysia is New Holland. The {{research was}} conducted in Langkawi and Kota Setar district. This research is significant for the conductor or owner to decide the best combine harvester before purchasing. The combine harvester with several ability and durability that can enhance {{the efficiency of the}} combine harvester in harvesting operation. Cross section survey that is use to collect the data and regression and correlation matrix is the data interpreted result in the research model. The distribution of critical parts have changed during repair and maintenance cost activities are ground speed vari-drive (24 %), shaft tire (18 %) and grain elevator drive (9 %), for the maintenance in off season the part normally changed are <b>wheel,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and pump bush track (10 %), Soucy track (9 %), and, straw walker and header (8 %). Combine harvester need to be repair and maintenance after usage in between 60 I to 900 hours in seasons. The owner or farmer need to repair and maintained the combine harvester to reduce the factor that enhance combine harvester breakdown. This problem needs to overcome to reduce the losses to owner of combine harvester. Machinery cost is the secondary highest cost after own the land...|$|E

German excavation technology in open cast mining, using Bucket <b>Wheel</b> Excavators, <b>Conveyors</b> and Spreaders {{were used for}} the first time in the country in Neyveli Mine-I. The capacity of this mine was 6.5 MT which met the fuel requirement of TS-I.

40|$|Digital {{technology}} {{has had a}} profound effect in every area of human activity. This {{technology has}} transformed the content and ideas of the printing press (ink and paper) into bitslbytes of electronic documents. Most importantly, digital technology has become a cornerstone in e-business and Internet marketing by increasing the ability of accessing and distributing information via electronic media. The focal point of this thesis is to design digital brochures for the Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA). PDF document will be used in converting the hard copy brochures into interactive electronic document format. These brochures include "Application Guidelines for Gravity Roller & <b>Wheel</b> <b>Conveyors</b> " and "Retail Trends & Conveyor Systems". Before the conversion, the texts and images will be updated in order to reflect the current changes in the industry and the true picture of the company. Then it will be formatted for on screen reading. Finally, bookmarks and thumbnails will be added to increase the navigability of the PDFdocuments. Based on the review for this research study, digital technology is still in its early stages of development despite the expanded uses of PDF that have gone well beyond its initial scope of viewing and printing. Looking ahead, applications of digital technology will become an increasingly integral part of every business in response to competition and demand, and Adobe will continue to take up these challenges.

Originally a European idea, the Motorized Pulley was slow in gaining acceptance in North America in the twentieth century.

25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket <b>wheel</b> excavators, and <b>conveyors.</b> In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|R
30|$|The {{clearance}} matching of chainless haulage {{system with}} a pitch of 147  mm was studied. First of all, the variable range of meshing central distance of the shearer walk <b>wheel</b> and scraper <b>conveyor</b> pin rail was determined. Its determination principles are: under the correct meshing situation, the minimum meshing central distance can warrant the no interference and no gear jam between walk wheel and pin rail (two section pin row connection), and it is usually approximately 10  mm less than the pitch radius of the walk wheel; the maximum meshing central distance must satisfy the rational meshing, the simulation shows that the increase of the meshing central distance has little effect, based on analysis and experience, the value is taken as 15  mm larger than the corresponding pitch radius of the walk wheel; a further increase of meshing central distance would cause: imprecise rolling, impact on gears from every contact and alteration, the wear of wheel gear and rack gear, etc.|$|R

40|$|Among {{all types}} of steels, {{austenitic}} stainless steel, mostly known for its formability and corrosion resistance, has found its utility in diverse field of applications including pipelines, automobile engine and gear parts. ISO/TR 15510 X 12 CrMnNiN 17 - 7 - 5 is a special grade of austenitic stainless steel which was developed to conserve Ni. This non-conventional stainless steel is used in automobile parts such as automotive trim, <b>wheel</b> covers, <b>conveyor</b> belts and railway train bodies etc. In most of these applications, components go through cyclic loading resulting in low cycle fatigue failure. In general, any deformation in metallic systems is controlled by its internal sub-structural variations (dislocation density) {{and so it is}} essential to study sub-structural changes in austenitic stainless steel under cyclic loading. Further, {{it is well known that}} austenite in stainless steel is metastable upon monotonic and cyclic deformation. In this investigation, strain induced transformation of austenite to martensitic using X-Ray diffraction profile analysis has been studied and volume fraction of martensitic and austenitic phases in cyclically deformed specimens under various constant strain amplitudes has been calculated. In order to calculate the dislocation densities and dislocation character in the specimens subjected to cyclic loading under various constant strain amplitudes X-ray diffraction profile analysis using the modified Williamson–Hall equation has been carried out. Estimation of dislocation density has also been done using variation in hardness values of deformed specimens subjected to varying loads incorporating the model of indentation size effect and compared with that of XRD profile analysis. It has been found that dislocation density increases with increase in strain amplitude which implies that non-conventional austenitic stainless steel is cyclically harden able material...|$|R
