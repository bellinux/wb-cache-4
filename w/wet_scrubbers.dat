25|$|A {{complicated}} {{blend of}} {{solid and liquid}} particles result in particulate matter and these particulate matter emissions are highly regulated in most industrialized countries. Due to environmental concerns, most industries are required to operate some kind of dust collection system to control particulate emissions. These systems include inertial collectors (cyclonic separators), fabric filter collectors (baghouses), <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> and electrostatic precipitators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> {{pass the}} dirty air through a {{scrubbing}} solution (usually {{a mixture of}} water and other compounds) allowing the particulate to attach to the liquid molecules. Electrostatic precipitators electrically charge the dirty air as it passes through. The now charged air then passes by large electrostatic plates which attract the charged particle in the airstream collecting them and leaving the now clean air to be exhausted or recirculated.|$|E
25|$|Fossil-fuel power stations, {{particularly}} coal-fired plants, are a {{major source}} of industrial wastewater. Many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, as well as arsenic, selenium and nitrogen compounds (nitrates and nitrites). Wastewater streams include flue-gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. Plants with air pollution controls such as <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream.|$|E

25|$|Acid gas {{scrubbers}} {{are used}} to remove hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, mercury, lead and other heavy metals. The efficiency of removal {{will depend on the}} specific equipment, the chemical composition of the waste, the design of the plant, the chemistry of reagents, and the ability of engineers to optimize these conditions, which may conflict for different pollutants. For example, mercury removal by <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> is considered coincidental and may be less than 50%. Basic scrubbers remove sulfur dioxide, forming gypsum by reaction with lime.|$|E

25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> which is commonly used. A <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|R
50|$|If the {{gas stream}} {{contains}} both particulate matter and gases, <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are generally the only single {{air pollution control}} device that can remove both pollutants. <b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> can achieve high removal efficiencies for either particles or gases and, in some instances, can achieve a high removal efficiency for both pollutants in the same system. However, in many cases, the best operating conditions for particles collection are the poorest for gas removal.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> or any air {{pollution}} control device depends on the industrial process conditions {{and the nature of}} the air pollutants involved.

The versatility of <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> allow them to be built in numerous configurations, all designed to provide good contact between the liquid and polluted gas stream.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 At the Oregon State University {{heating plant}} {{the primary source}} of heat energy is natural gas with crude oil as the standby supply of fuel.

The main purpose of this investigation is to resolve the problem of economically and effectively eliminating the polluting characteristics of the flue gases produced by the combustion of the sulfur-rich fuel oils. After consulting the recent literature in the field of air sanitation, an impingement <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> system was constructed and employed in order to determine its capability to remove sulfur dioxide and the nitrogen oxides in the gaseous effluents at the OSU heating plant. The scrubbing slurry was comprised of a mixture of water from the city's water system plus measured amounts of sodium carbonate. Gas samples were analyzed directly from the stack, and then again immediately after passing through the <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber.</b> It was shown that the <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> effectively removed all traces of the 600 ppm sulfur dioxide concentration from the flue gases, and that the 310 ppm oxides of nitrogen value was reduced by 60 to 85...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{atmospheric}} pollution {{is a major}} concern for urban populations. Currently, no effective strategy has been adopted to tackle the problem. The paper presents the Smart Clean Air City project, a pilot experiment concerning the improvement in urban air quality. Small <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> systems will be operating in a network configuration in suitable urban areas of LâAquila city (Italy).

Measurements of particle size distributions in the range of 0. 30 â 25 Âµm took place in the two sites of interest, an urban background and a traffic area in the city of LâAquila.
