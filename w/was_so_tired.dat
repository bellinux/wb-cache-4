25|$|Zamora {{enrolled}} at Miami Dade College {{and decided to}} make a career as an AIDS educator. He began to lecture at schools of all levels, PTA meetings, churches, traveling the country, sitting on the boards of various AIDS organizations, and hoping to use what time he had left to prevent others from sharing his fate. In five years, he spoke publicly hundreds of times, attended an international AIDS conference, and accepted a position on the board of a charitable trust endowed by insurance companies (although he had no insurance himself), through which he {{came to the attention of}} the media. The constant travel took its toll on Zamora, who at times <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that he was forced to cancel speaking engagements.|$|E
25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
500|$|Tired {{of being}} both typecast and being {{passed over for}} lead Asian {{character}} roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe. Interviewed by Doris Mackie for Film Weekly in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of the parts I had to play." [...] She commented: [...] "There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles." ...|$|E

I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> of having this {{abnormal}} thing reflected in the eyes of all my visitors. I wish I could become commonplace--without the slightest thing queer about me. Sometimes I feel like taking a dose of poison and ending it all." ...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Cleveland after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, {{with more than}} 1,000 people in {{attendance}} at the Carter Hotel. Feller said to the crowd: [...] "The real heroes didn't come home." [...] Later that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits {{in the game and}} earned a win in the Indians' 4–2 victory. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game", Feller said. For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50ERA.|$|E
2500|$|Anquetil rode on {{the inside}} by the {{mountain}} wall while Poulidor took the outer edge by the precipice. They could sometimes feel the other's hot gasps on their bare arms. At the end, Anquetil cracked, after a battle of wills and legs so intense that at times they banged elbows. Poulidor says he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> {{that he has no}} memory of the two touching, although a photograph shows that they did. Of Anquetil, the veteran French reporter Pierre Chany wrote: [...] "His face, until then purple, lost all its colour; the sweat ran down in drops through the creases of his cheeks." [...] Anquetil was only semiconscious, he said. Poulidor gained time but when they reached Paris, Anquetil still had a 55-second lead and won his last Tour de France thanks to the time-trial on the final day.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the night}} wore on, the exhausted, freezing, and soaking wet men aboard the {{overturned}} Collapsible [...] "B" [...] found {{it almost impossible}} to remain on the slick keel. Gracie later wrote that over half the men who had originally reached the collapsible were claimed by exhaustion or cold and slipped off the upturned keel during the night. As dawn broke and it became possible for those in other lifeboats to see them, Second Officer Lightoller (who was also on the collapsible, along with Wireless Operator Harold Bride) used his officer's whistle to attract the other boats' attention; eventually lifeboats Nos. 4 and 12 rowed over and took the remaining men off the overturned boat. Gracie <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired</b> that he was unable to make the jump himself and was pulled into lifeboat No. 12, the last to reach RMS Carpathia when that ship, captained by Arthur Henry Rostron, arrived on the scene.|$|E

2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>tired,</b> I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
