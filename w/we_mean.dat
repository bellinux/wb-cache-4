5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

Cultism, in short, is any major deviation from orthodox Christianity relative to the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith.|$|E

25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E

In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that [...] "socialists must sing what <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> and sing it like <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> it". [...] Under Bush's influence the [...] "music of the workers" [...] moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, Arthur Bourchier's mid-1920s pamphlet Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism, towards an expression with broader popular appeal.|$|E

[...] The United States Third Fleet began shelling the Japanese coast. In the largest bombing raid of the Pacific War, more than 400 B-29s attacked Japan during daylight on August 14, and more than 300 that night. A total of 1,014 aircraft were used with no losses.|$|E
500|$|When the Peano axioms {{were first}} proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by a [...] "natural number". {{of which the}} series of the natural numbers is one instance. Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were consistent; {{if there is a}} proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their {{consistency}} using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.|$|E
500|$|With {{his left}} hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States {{successfully}} {{at the start of}} 1930, propped up by his recent European success. That year Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet On the Dnieper, Op. 51, a work commissioned by Serge Lifar, who had been appointed maitre de ballet at the Paris Opéra. In 1931 and 1932, he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos. The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song, Op. 57, which Prokofiev's friend Myaskovsky – thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union – told him [...] "isn't quite for us... it lacks that which <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by monumentalism – a familiar simplicity and broad contours, of which you are extremely capable, but temporarily are carefully avoiding." ...|$|E

[...] Tynan wrote in 1964, [...] "Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'." [...] In praise of Coward's versatility, Lord Mountbatten said, in a tribute on Coward's seventieth birthday, [...] "There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels – The Master." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy gave the song {{five out of}} five stars, saying that [...] "Once named the least desirable member of Girls Aloud, the transformation of Nicola Roberts from pasty and awkward backing singer into glowing, haute couture pop songstress has been a magnificent spectacle." [...] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard called Roberts' effort the most [...] "intriguing" [...] {{out of all the}} Girls Aloud solo efforts. He said that Roberts had potential for success in the United States, comparing the song to the work of such artists as M.I.A., Robyn and Kelis. He asked readers to imagine that [...] "a young M.I.A. – mixed with Robyn and band Yelle – went on a shopping spree to Urban Outfitters, started chanting [...] "L! O! V! E!" [...] and turned it all into a true summer anthem." [...] A writer from Popjustice noted that [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] "hardly happened by accident" [...] but that [...] "it feels really carefree and spontaneous", explaining [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by that is that you can tell a lot of care and attention has gone into it".|$|E
500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by that, is not proven; {{but that does not}} mean that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E

After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. <b>We</b> <b>mean,</b> really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E

I think they're one of the greatest bands ever." [...] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, [...] "they really changed my life when I was 16 years oldI'd never heard anything that heavy". Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppetsand the staying powera timeless record like that". Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, [...] "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a [...] "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are [...] "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know what <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E
