5|$|After five {{successful}} seasons, Chris Carter <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story}} of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film.

Unsuccessful in convincing the South African Television Company to pursue such a series, he decided to change the medium to that of film.

5|$|After five {{successful}} {{seasons of}} The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story of}} the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film: the 1998 X-Files movie. The film grossed US$83,898,313 in the US and $105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of $189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned $30,138,758 which was 35.9% of its total gross. Initially, the fifth season of The X-Files {{was supposed to be the}} show's last. However, the series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the sixth season of the show began filming.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns {{originated}} during development of XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development of Lightning Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> more stories about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players to forget the story of the previous games, and the team needed to work especially hard as a result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E

25|$|According to Li, {{everything}} {{he has ever}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the world can be}} found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows that violence is never a solution; and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E
25|$|Fei-Wang {{is located}} in an area cut off from time {{in the ruins of}} the Kingdom of Clow created by the {{original}} Syaoran when he wished to turn back time after he placed a death seal on the original Sakura. As a result of this wish, Fei-Wang took the original Syaoran and Sakura prisoner to set up his plan. When the original Syaoran manages to rescue the original Sakura from the death seal, Fei-Wang obtains the powers from the two Sakuras to revive Yūko, breaking a logic that starts causing all the worlds to be destroyed. This leads to a battle against two Syaorans, the two Sakuras, Fai and Kurogane, in which the clones manage to undo Fei-Wang's damage to the world. In the course of the battle, Fei-Wang is mortally wounded by Kurogane, and his body starts disintegrating leading to the belief he was created by a powerful magician. However, before disappearing, he traps the two Syaorans and Watanuki in a void, while stating he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Yūko something. In the original Japanese series, Fei-Wang is voiced by Kazuhiro Nakata. For the English dub of the anime adaptation, Fei-Wang Reed is voiced by Randy Tallman in first season and by R Bruce Elliott in the second season and the OVAs.|$|E

Naomi instantly had second thoughts and when Paul <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> everyone, {{in the hope that}} it might boost his mayoral position, she asked him to keep their engagement a secret. Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh. Paul asked if they could try and work out their differences, but Naomi declined and he told her she would not amount to anything.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the day, UVA's {{incredible}} story fit Erdely's narrative better than Vanderbilt's credible one. Erdely <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of a campus body and university administration behaving indifferently to an unspeakable crime. ... What distinguished the UVA story from anything else ever reported was that the assault did not involve drugs or alcohol, required elaborate planning, and involved so many people that the perps could not have reasonably expected to get away with it—a confluence of factors that caused the allegations to have substantially more in common with ones that ultimately proved to be false, like the Duke lacrosse case and Tawana Brawley incident.|$|E
500|$|This season's {{production}} run (8F) {{was the last}} to be animated by Klasky Csupo, before the show's producers Gracie Films opted to switch domestic production of the series to Film Roman.

Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all.

[...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|The couple's backstory was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} told during season three; however during season two, the Lost writers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story of one}} of the background characters of the show. As Rose and Bernard are the most prominent of these characters, and fans were keen to learn their backstory, they decided to do an episode focusing on the couple. Caldwell's husband was going through health problems during the shooting of the first season, which was the inspiration for Rose's flashbacks in [...] "S.O.S.". Following this episode, Caldwell did not think Rose's healing {{had anything to do with}} the Island and stated [...] "If she is cured, it's because she's willed it herself".|$|E
500|$|The initial {{creative}} {{team was}} writer Jamie Delano and artist John Ridgway, with Dave McKean supplying distinctive painted and collage covers. Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: [...] "...generally I {{was interested in}} commenting on 1980s Britain. That was where I was living, it was shit, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> everybody." [...] The book, originally published as a regular DC Comics title, became a Vertigo title with the imprint's launch in March 1993 (issue #63 of the series). In October 2011, {{it was announced that}} this would join DC titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release, starting in January 2012.|$|E

500|$|Typically, wordless novels used relief {{printing}} {{techniques such as}} woodcuts, wood engraving, metalcuts, or linocuts. [...] One of the oldest printing techniques, {{relief printing}} has its origins in 8th-century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century. [...] It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block; the areas not to be printed (the white areas) are cut away, leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints. [...] The monochrome prints were usually in black ink, and occasionally in a different colour such as sienna or orange. [...] Relief printing is an inexpensive but labour-intensive printing technique; it was accessible to socially conscious artists who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> wordless stories of the working classes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About {{five years ago}} I decided I wanted to write this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day.
