It was a desirable attribute which could be found in all cultivated societies, and something <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> practice for Singapore’s own self-esteem. If tourists do find Singapore a courteous nation, it was because it was ‘incidental’. This ‘prodding’ by Lee Kuan Yew thus saw the birth of the National Courtesy Campaign, which became a recurrent, annual campaign that was seen as a long-term project of aiming to imbue values of courtesy into Singaporeans within a period of 10 years.|$|E

Over the next three semesters, however, the story veered from its original focus of mother-child separation to what Domalpalli later described as a study of [...] "elements of class distinction and conflict that continue to infuse our society and culture even today." [...] Referring to its emphasis, he said the film was also about [...] "fading institutions of folk art, old buildings that are collapsing, things <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be protecting— which are a part of our heritage."

An {{anonymous}} review of Keats's poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 Scots Magazine stated: [...] "Amongst the minor poems we prefer the 'Ode to the Nightingale.' Indeed, we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book; but let the reader judge. The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{find it difficult to}} explain.

[...] At the same time, Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats's poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 The Indicator: [...] "As a specimen of the Poems, which are all lyrical, we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the 'Ode to a Nightingale'. There is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief, which poetry alone presents us in her 'charmed cup,' and which some over-rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true. It does not follow that what is not true to them, is not true to others. If the relief is real, the mixture is good and sufficing." ...|$|E
