5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 June 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion. The North Koreans were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to South Korea's capital of Seoul within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat farther south.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, {{abruptly}} {{crossed the}} operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In {{response to this}} flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally came around and approved an operation against Nanking, though by then many of Japan's units in the field were already <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way.|$|E

It is different from treatment of insomnia, and recognizes the patients' ability to sleep <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own schedules, while addressing the timing problem.

25|$|On 10 July, General Glaise-Horstenau added:Our {{troops have}} to be mute {{witnesses}} of such events; it does not reflect <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> otherwise high reputation... I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Ustaše crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, I could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} ODI against South Africa at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua-Barbuda, West Indies {{appeared}} <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> {{way to a}} second consecutive loss. 200–6 in the 41st over, well short of their winning target of 301, Sammy joined Dwayne Bravo at the crease. But six sixes and two fours later, {{it looked as though}} West Indies might just win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E
25|$|Thirty five {{first half}} points and 547 yards of total offense set the Razorbacks <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> {{way to their}} second win of the season, {{at the expense of}} the South Florida Bulls. Only a field goal with a minute left in the game kept the Razorbacks from having a shutout, which would have been their first in two years. Back-up quarterback Tarvaris Jackson led a 94-yard scoring drive of his own, after three scoring drives by Matt Jones. Jackson would {{eventually}} transfer from Arkansas to Alabama A after Matt Jones became the apparent starting quarterback. South Florida had eight consecutive wins, the second-longest win streak in the nation, coming into this contest.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it was Black {{who was the}} {{original}} target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 scouting trip to Richmond. Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks ("You mean you want him?!") {{and the fact that}} Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge was pointless since the Pirates, <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to a fourth consecutive last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.|$|E

25|$|The Air Ministry still {{saw little}} {{immediate}} {{value in the}} effort (they regarded it as long-range research), and having no production facilities of its own, Power Jets entered into an agreement with steam turbine specialists British Thomson-Houston (BTH) to build an experimental engine facility at a BTH factory in Rugby, Warwickshire. Work progressed quickly, {{and by the end}} of the year 1936 the prototype detail design was finalised and parts for it were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to being completed, all within the original £2,000 budget. However, by 1936, Germany had also started working on jet engines (Herbert A. Wagner at Junkers and Hans von Ohain at Heinkel) and, although they too had difficulty overcoming conservatism, the German Ministry of Aviation (Reichsluftfahrtministerium) was more supportive than their British counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the second time around, Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the order}} to {{withdraw}} was given, the first priority was to hold the large bridgehead from Makhadet Hajlah to the line now held by infantry from the 60th (London) Division in front of Shunet Nimrin, {{and on to the}} Umm esh Shert until the withdrawal from Es Salt was completed. At 17:15 Hodgson ordered the withdrawal of his force. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade covered the first stage of the withdrawal to a rearguard position south-west of Es Salt, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade took up a position across the Umm esh Shert track south-west of Es Salt, and facing east piqueting the heights covering the Umm esh Shert track all the way down from the rearguard position to the Jordan Valley. Two hours after the last wounded and camels left, a force of 3,000 German and Ottoman infantry attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Es Salt. As the wounded were now <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way down to the valley, Chauvel, the commander of Desert Mounted Corps, ordered Hodgson to withdraw to a position south-west of Es Salt covering the Umm esh Shert track.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{the school}} board voted to close three schools, Clearlake middle school, Gardendale Elementary Magnet School, and South Lake {{elementary}} school prompting a large public outcry. The school board proposed the closings and limited public input by holding required public meetings during the 2012 holiday season. The Board did not hold any of the required meetings with the capital oulay committee as required by an interlocal agreement with several municipalities. The Brevard Board of County Commissioners, City of Cocoa, and City of Titusville ccondemend the decision in official letters sent to Superintedent Brian Bingelli and the board. The Board of County Commissioners voted to file a lawsuit against {{the school board}} 3-2, however a minimum of 4 votes were required to initiate the lawsuit per county ordinance.

He commented that [...] "we didn't go into our meeting for Pirates with great expectations, but came out pleasantly amazed at the potential of the game." [...] Joystiq's Mike Schramm compared the game to Fable, noting that [...] "what is there looks good– the combat was solid, if a little shallow, and the graphics and polish are <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, as {{more and}} more Japanese units {{continued}} to slip past the operation restriction line, Tada was also coming under pressure from within the Army General Staff. Many of Tada's colleagues and subordinates, including the powerful Chief of the General Staff Operations Division Sadamu Shimomura, had come around to Matsui's viewpoint and wanted Tada to approve an attack on Nanking. On November 24 Tada finally relented and abolished the operation restriction line [...] "owing to circumstances beyond our control", and then several days later he reluctantly approved the operation to capture Nanking. Tada flew to Shanghai in person on December 1 to deliver the order, though by then his own armies in the field were already <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way to Nanking.|$|E

Nicole began dating a student from university, Angus McCathie (Tim Pocock), they got along <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> first dates. Marilyn was left worried about their agreement and she felt [...] "distanced." [...] Symons explained, [...] "Marilyn is scared of being replaced.
