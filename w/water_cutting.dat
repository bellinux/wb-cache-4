25|$|According to {{information}} {{obtained by the}} Macedonian intelligence service, the attack was conducted by more than six hundred NLA insurgents, supported by volunteers from the Kosovo Protection Corps. The Corps came {{from the town of}} Krivenik in Kosovo and crossed the Macedonian border into Raduša during the night. According to the same information, the NLA plan of action was to neutralise the security forces in the Raduša sector, then penetrate southwards and capture the Rašče water spring which feeds the Macedonian capital Skopje with drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Cutting</b> water supplies would create a humanitarian crisis in the city.|$|E
25|$|The M2 {{was still}} busy between Junctions 1 and 4, and {{suffered}} from HGVs blocking the outside lane. In 2000 work began on widening the M2 from two lanes to four lanes. A {{joint venture between}} Costain, Skanska and Mowlem (CSM) created the company that would undertake the project. The project required the redesign of Junction 2 and Junction 3, and a second Medway Bridge. The existing bridge was converted to a four lane eastbound carriageway (including a hard shoulder). The new bridge formed the westbound carriageway. The entire stretch was lit with streetlights (the old section was not lit). The old Medway Bridge was physically narrowed by removing part of the footpath. High-pressure <b>water</b> <b>cutting</b> equipment was used to cut the concrete into manageable sections for disposal. There is only one path {{open to the public}} now.|$|E
25|$|Kingani {{was spotted}} from the shore, and Spicer-Simson's men quickly {{took to the}} <b>water,</b> <b>cutting</b> Kingani off from her base. Taken by {{surprise}} Junge ordered Kinganis speed to be increased, but as the six-pounder gun mounted in the forepart of Kingani could only fire forward, {{he was forced to}} circle to aim at the lead British boat, Mimi. The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and waved a white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed back to shore.|$|E

50|$|Today {{other forms}} of metal cutting are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. An {{example of this is}} <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting.</b> <b>Water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> involves pressurized <b>water</b> in excess of 620 MPa (90 000 psi) and is able to cut metal and have a finished product. This process is called cold cutting, which eliminates the damage caused by a heat affected zone, as opposed to laser and plasma cutting.|$|R
25|$|Managing CO2 levels was a {{particular}} challenge, {{and a source of}} controversy regarding the Biosphere 2 project's alleged misrepresentation to the public. Daily fluctuation of carbon dioxide dynamics was typically 600 ppm because of the strong drawdown during sunlight hours by plant photosynthesis, followed by a similar rise during the nighttime when system respiration dominated. As expected, there was also a strong seasonal signature to CO2 levels, with wintertime levels as high as 4,000-4,500 ppm and summertime levels near 1,000 ppm. The crew worked to manage the CO2 by occasionally turning on a CO2 scrubber, activating and de-activating the desert and savannah through control of irrigation <b>water,</b> <b>cutting</b> and storing biomass to sequester carbon, and utilizing all potential planting areas with fast-growing species to increase system photosynthesis. In November 1991, investigative reporting in the Village Voice alleged that the crew had secretly installed the CO2 scrubber device, violating Biosphere 2's advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally.|$|E

The vast concave of sky above was of violet, infinite and flawless. Far out dusky amethystine islets clustered like gems on the shining breast of the bay. The little pools of water along the low shores glowed like mirrors of polished jacinth.

40|$|Because of its {{significant}} {{advantages of}} low thermal influence on workpiece and possibility of cutting {{different type of}} materials, the abrasive <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> {{is more and more}} present in industry. One of the bigger costs during abrasive <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> is the cost of abrasives. Recommended and required abrasive flow rate is mostly determined by type of workpiece material and its thickness and pump pressure. In intent to reduce the abrasive mass consumption in cutting, some experiments were done and the paper presents the results of changing the abrasive flow rate (mass flow) and its influence on surface cut quality in abrasive <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting.</b> Abrasive saving possibility and also the influence of cutting nozzle distance from workpiece surface on surface cut quality in abrasive <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental turning {{tests of}} carbon steels at low cuuting speed {{are made by}} using <b>water</b> base <b>cutting</b> fluids in various kinds of tool materials, to {{investigate}} the excessive wear phenomenon at the portion near center of tools in machining of holes using <b>water</b> base <b>cutting</b> fluids. From the experiments, the following results are mainly attained: (1) The reasons of tool wear in the low cutting speed will be not attributed to chemical interaction between tool and work due to temperature, but the actions of mechanical attrition. (2) The amount of wear in <b>water</b> base <b>cutting</b> fluids is remarkably different from dry or cutting oils, which is attributed to the differences of falling type of the built-up-edge and type of chip flow. (3) The selections of suitable cutting conditions and tool materials for the work materials are the most significant for using <b>water</b> base <b>cutting</b> fluids at the low cutting speed...|$|R

60|$|Toward midday the fog lifted {{suddenly}} {{and the wind}} freshened, and lookouts were stationed in the tops. There was little hope indeed of any English merchantmen having come over so far toward the French coast, but British cruisers might be anywhere. A few distant sails could be seen far out on the horizon proceeding up or down channel; but the captain of La Belle Marie {{had no idea of}} commencing operations until very much further away from the shores of England. All day the vessel ran down the French coast; and although he was a captive, and every mile reeled off the log took him further from home, Ralph could not help admiring the speed at which the brig slipped through the <b>water,</b> <b>cutting</b> the waves with her sharp bow and leaving scarcely a ripple behind her, so fine and clean was her run. Very different was this smooth, gliding motion from the quick plunge and shock of the bluff-bowed fishing boat to which he was accustomed. The sails had been scrubbed until there was not a speck upon them. The masts were lofty and tapering, the rigging neat and trim, and every stay as taut as iron.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{which we could}} see upon the shore which seemed to me so {{wonderful}} as the great sheet of water before us. Our numbers and our noise had frightened all living creatures away, and save for a few pterodactyls, which soared round high above our heads while {{they waited for the}} carrion, all was still around the camp. But it was different out upon the rose-tinted waters of the central lake. It boiled and heaved with strange life. Great slate-colored backs and high serrated dorsal fins shot up with a fringe of silver, and then rolled down into the depths again. The sand-banks far out were spotted with uncouth crawling forms, huge turtles, strange saurians, and one great flat creature like a writhing, palpitating mat of black greasy leather, which flopped its way slowly to the lake. Here and there high serpent heads projected out of the <b>water,</b> <b>cutting</b> swiftly through it with a little collar of foam in front, and a long swirling wake behind, rising and falling in graceful, swan-like undulations as they went. It was not until one of these creatures wriggled on to a sand-bank within a few hundred yards of us, and exposed a barrel-shaped body and huge flippers behind the long serpent neck, that Challenger, and Summerlee, who had joined us, broke out into their duet of wonder and admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "After I {{got married}} I sold my horses, and, taking all my money, {{purchased}} two ox-carts, intending {{to make my}} living by carrying freight. One cart I drove myself, and to drive the other I hired a boy whom I called Mula, though {{that was not the}} name his godfathers gave him, but because he was stubborn and sullen as a mule. His mother was a poor widow, living near me, and when she heard about the ox-carts she came to me with her son and said, 'Neighbour Mariano, for your mother's sake, take my son and teach him to earn his bread, for he is a boy that loves not to do anything.' So I took Mula and paid the widow for his services after each journey. When there was no freight to be had I sometimes went to the lagoons to cut rushes, and, loading the carts with them, we would go about the country to sell the rushes to those who required them to thatch their houses. Mula loved not this work. Often when we were all day wading up to our thighs in the <b>water,</b> <b>cutting</b> the rushes down close to their roots, then carrying them in large bundles on our shoulders to land, he would cry, complaining bitterly of his hard lot. Sometimes I thrashed him, for it angered me to see a poor boy so fastidious: then he would curse me and say that some day he would have his revenge. 'When I am dead,' he often told me, 'my ghost will come to haunt and terrify you for all the blows you have given me.' This always made me laugh.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> {{has been}} {{established}} in many areas of industrial manufacturing. The industrial cutting systems have to maintain high quality and security standards. They should enable easy operating even by unskilled workers. During the past years modeling and control solutions for single parameters have been evaluated in research. Industrial users though need more information and functions than these isolated solutions can provide. Therefore an integrated concept is needed, i. e. a process control system that visualizes process parameters, wear and malfunctions and that controls the whole <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> system. This paper describes a concept to combine single control solutions for specific parameters for <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> systems. This integrated concept of process control is based on modeling the entire <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> system. With sensor and control signals as input parameters the system states and the system components are modelled. The software structure using object orienta ted architecture is designed for easy adaptation of new sensors and additional software modules. The modular concept also supports easy adaptation to different machines. This here discussed approach to process control provides control and diagnosis devices and security functions for easy and safe operation. This paper illustrates how integrated concepts of process control can increase cost effectiveness and availability of the <b>water</b> jet <b>cutting</b> system and enable data collection and integration into production lines...|$|R
