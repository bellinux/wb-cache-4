In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E

The role of the energy management system is to yield battery reference current, which is subsequently used by the controller of the DC/DC converter.

40|$|A wider spread {{adoption}} of power electronic converters interfaced renewable energy systems has brought {{more attention to}} harmonic issues to the electrical grid, and means are taken to improve it in the control. More advanced closed-loop harmonic controllers are thus demanded to enhance the renewable energy integration {{in order to be}} grid-friendly. However, usually being treated as a constant factor in the design of harmonic controllers, the grid frequency varies with the generation-load imbalance, and thus may lead to deterioration of the power quality. This paper explores the frequency sensitivity of the most popular harmonic controllers for grid-interfaced converters. The frequency adaptability of these harmonic controllers is evaluated {{in the presence of a}} variable grid frequency <b>within</b> <b>a</b> specified <b>reasonable</b> range, e. g., ± 1 % of the nominal grid frequency (50 Hz). Solutions to the improvement of the frequency variation immunity of the discussed harmonic controllers are also emphasized.

40|$|Katzner et al. 1 Eagle populations {{worldwide}} are {{in decline}} and their demography is generally poorly understood. We use novel sensitivity analysis of stochastic simulation models to analyse the demography {{of the worlds}} highest-density and longest-studied population of eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), at the Naurzum National Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan. Single variable perturbation (a simple elasticity-type analysis) showed that population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survival but provided no information on how interactions between parameters may influence population growth. Multiple-variable perturbations (a more comprehensive elasticity-type analysis) suggested that population growth is relatively more sensitive to adult survival than is indicated by single-variable perturbation but also that when adult survival is <b>within</b> <b>a</b> biologically <b>reasonable</b> range, other parameters are still highly consequential to model outputs. For Naurzum’s imperial eagles, and for other structured populations of vertebrates, effective conservation and management likely requires an approach that addresses the importance of simultaneous variation in multiple vital rates including both survivorship and reproductive output...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Accurate and {{consistent}} segmentation of infant brain MR images {{plays an important}} role in quantifying the early brain development, especially in longitudinal studies. However, due to rapid maturation and myelination of brain tissues in the first year of life, white-gray matter contrast undergoes dramatic changes. In fact, the contrast inverses around 6 months of age, where the white and gray matter tissues are isointense and hence exhibit the lowest contrast, posing significant challenges for segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel longitudinally guided level set method for segmentation of serial infant brain MR images, acquired from 2 weeks up to 1. 5 years of age. The proposed method makes optimal use of T 1, T 2 and the diffusion weighted images for complimentary tissue distribution information to address the difficulty caused by the low contrast. A longitudinally consistent term, which constrains the distance across the serial images <b>within</b> <b>a</b> biologically <b>reasonable</b> range, is employed to obtain temporally consistent segmentation results. The proposed method has been applied on 22 longitudinal infant subjects with promising results. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{find the}} native {{conformation}} (fold), proteins sample a subspace that is typically hundreds of {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than their full conformational space. Whether such fast folding is intrinsic or the result of natural selection, {{and what is the}} longest foldable protein, are open questions. Here, we derive the average conformational degeneracy of a lattice polypeptide chain in water and quantitatively show that the constraints associated with hydrophobic forces are themselves sufficient to reduce the effective conformational space to a size compatible with the folding of proteins up to approximately 200 amino acids long <b>within</b> <b>a</b> biologically <b>reasonable</b> amount of time. This size range is in general agreement with the experimental protein domain length distribution obtained from approximately 1, 200 proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Trp-cage protein confirm this picture on the free energy landscape. Our analytical and computational results are consistent with a model in which the length and time scales of protein folding, as well as the modular nature of large proteins, are dictated primarily by inherent physical forces, whereas natural selection determines the native state...|$|R

The OH(OD) oscillators were treated as mixed cubic – quartic anharmonic systems. The influence of hydrogen bonding on these oscillators was introduced through the changes in the harmonic diagonal force constants (as proposed by Sceats and Rice 1), the other diagonal terms in the potential energy expression being regarded as practically unchanged in the course of the hydrogen bonding. The parameters obtained by empirical correlations, within the proposed model, describe the dependence of the intramolecular potential of the uncoupled OH(OD) species on the hydrogen bond strength...|$|R
