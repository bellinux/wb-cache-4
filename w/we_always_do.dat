2500|$|Gutiérrez {{was handed}} a twenty-second time penalty after the {{stewards}} judged {{him to have}} been responsible for the collision between himself and Grosjean which punctured the Sauber's right-rear tyre although they accepted the view he had brake problems. Gutiêrrez stated his brake problems had appeared in [...] "an inconsistency that sometimes you cannot predict" [...] and that he did not move lines purposefully and the contact with Grosjean was [...] "an unfortunate moment." [...] Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn deemed the incident [...] "unnecessary" [...] and Grosjean said he was not sure as to what happened with Gutiérrez. Concerning Bottas's poor start that dropped him down the field, Williams performance chief Rob Smedley announced the team were investigating the problem and revealed they originally believed it was an issue relating to the clutch. Bottas stated he felt he was too assertive with his clutch and his race was hindered when he was unable to accelerate with the normal amount of speed leaving the chicane: [...] "The start on the formation lap – when <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> the final checks – was a bit compromised because Lewis had a slow getaway, so that maybe hurt a little bit. But definitely the tyres were not in the optimum window." ...|$|E

60|$|MISS SUSAN. Indeed, sir, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> By to-morrow {{this will}} be my dear blue and white room again, and that my sweet spare bedroom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be damned}} if I would! No--stick it out! Do? Why, take old Elk and hold him till the tribe {{produces}} the right man--that's the way <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> before." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{anthropogenic}} climate change will be devastating. Nevertheless, {{most people do not}} seem to be seriously concerned. We consume as much as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> drive as much as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> eat as much meat as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> What can <b>we</b> do to overcome this collective apathy? In order to be able to develop effective measures, we must first get clear about the causes of climate change inaction. In this paper I ask whether moral nihilism (the denial of moral truths) is a significant cause of climate change inaction. The answer to this question depends mainly on the extent to which being a moral nihilist reduces one’s likelihood of taking action against climate change. At first sight, the extent seems to be considerable. I will argue, however, that this assumption is false. Only slightly more non-nihilists than nihilists are led to climate-friendly actions by moral considerations. And in absolute terms, morality plays such a minor role in leading people to act that the difference is barely noticeable...|$|R
60|$|BARON RAFF. What have <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> in Russia when a Czar {{suggests}} reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men {{of thought}} should {{have nothing to}} do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but they always end in a farce.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean that, dear," [...] {{she said}} softly. [...] "I mean--your not quarrelling {{with me when}} I'm unreasonable. Why can't <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All of us. Frank {{invited the}} whole set, {{and we shall}} have a tip-top time. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> at the Minots'," [...] cried Sue, the timid trembler.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Anne, mashing the {{potatoes}} {{with the air}} of one expected to do her duty. [...] "I put a spoonful of sugar in. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> Don't you like it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we had {{our full}} share of fighting, too. I was very {{fortunate}} in only getting hit three or four times, with slugs; but as we were {{for the most part}} fighting against men hidden in the bush, it was unsatisfactory work, though <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> lick them in the end. I can assure you that I do not wish for any more service of that kind.|$|R
2500|$|The Boy Scout Council {{wanted to}} fill the dam in time for their short, three-week summer camping season. When Fish and Game would not make an exception, the Council {{contacted}} California State Senator Bruce McPherson, Vice-Chairman of the California State Senate Environmental Quality Committee, who called the head of Fish and Game, Robert Hight. Hight, now a judge, commented, [...] "We received political pressure from legislators all the time, but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> the right thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>we</b> should <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{the things}} that gentle-folk should do," [...] said Bince, grinning, after being seated safely in the car. They had turned out of the {{driveway}} into Lincoln Parkway.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{as well as}} that," [...] Captain Davenant said, as they {{finished}} the meal, [...] "we shall {{have no reason to}} grumble. But I fear that's too much to expect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no, ma'am,' said John. 'We white-limed {{the walls}} and arches the day 'twas opened, as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> and again {{on the morning of}} the funeral; the place is as sweet as a granary.|$|E
60|$|I am shocked if I {{also made}} the mistake of {{confounding}} those two (and too) similar names.[12] But I think Mr. S-T-A-F-F-O-R-D had better do the Marquis. I am glad to find that we agree, but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! He does not,' cried Laura; 'he only {{looks on}} it as <b>we</b> have <b>always</b> <b>done,</b> {{as a sort of}} romantic {{appendage}} to Redclyffe. I should think better of a place for being haunted.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Working {{with these}} kids is a little tough sometimes," [...] said Karl Malden of the film's {{youthful}} cast. [...] "Still, they're eager and they're learning. And <b>we</b> can <b>always</b> <b>do</b> retakes if something goes wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yakasty Abreu and Elizabeth Espiritusanto {{have done}} several solo {{performances}} {{outside of the}} band and have stated that [...] "If things don't work out with the girls then <b>we</b> can <b>always</b> <b>do</b> our own solo thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, ma'am," [...] said Matlack; [...] "that's {{the only}} one we've got. And now I guess I'll go see about supper. This has been a lazy day for us, but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> calc'late on a lazy day to begin with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I was dressing," [...] {{supplemented}} Pepper. [...] "Come {{to think}} of it, I rather fancy we were all dressing. You see, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> dress when we {{get up in the}} morning, Mr. Crabtree," [...] he added with a simple smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not so sure. She coughed {{a little}} last night, {{and would not}} eat her supper. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> have a little supper. A {{despatched}} crab it was; and when she would not eat it I {{knew there was something}} wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> speak English at home. Our {{father made}} {{a rule that}} <b>we</b> should <b>always</b> <b>do</b> so; {{as he said it}} would be an immense {{disadvantage}} to us, when we returned to England, if we had the slightest French accent. Our mother now speaks English as purely and correctly as our father." ...|$|R

50|$|Novaya Gazeta's deputy {{editor-in-chief}} Sergei Sokolov denies to Index on Censorship any politics behinds the firing. ‘Job cuts, {{including some}} of the star writers, are a result of the investors' decision to cut the funding of the paper. This {{has nothing to do with}} professional performance.' Sokolov added that the job cuts ‘will certainly affect the paper, but not catastrophically'. He said that the newspaper will continue to monitor the secret services, ‘like <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> even before collaborating with Agentura'. Sokolov added that the coverage of Politkovsakya's murder case, which he is overseeing himself, will not be affected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course we'll go," [...] said Lily; [...] "why not? <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> And we'll have blind-man's-buff {{with all}} the Boyces, as we had last year, if uncle will ask them up." [...] But the Boyces were not asked up for that occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. To meet them. They {{are coming}} in to Simla to send down their horns and heads to be dressed at Calcutta. They are {{exclusively}} sporting gentlemen, and they are allowed special faceelities by the Government. Of course, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> that. It is our British pride.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> it Sundays and Thanksgivings? Wouldn't Ma {{wish the}} {{children}} kept safe and warm anyhow?

5000|$|... “...basically it {{was what}} all improvisational groups do. There were {{audience}} suggestions, about, just about everything. We did set pieces and audience suggestion pieces and then <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> one act based on the news, so that it, {{it was kind of}} new and fresh or at least seemed new and fresh, ‘cause they were formulae to get at various kinds of spoofing the news. But, but, you know, and the audience would suggest a movie or a year or a, a nationality or an event of some kind and we’d act it out. But we were determined to do it…” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} {{to some of}} the other Accept albums, Wolf Hoffmann recalls Objection Overruled as an easy one to record: [...] "That was great! I mean, making up and having reunions are always great in a way because you feel that sort of spirit or fresh wind again. It was great! We had a ball back then," [...] adding, [...] "we just really pretty much made records like <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> and felt like we should use the old formulas with no more sort of experiments and just pretty much do what Accept is known for; and that's what we did." ...|$|R
60|$|Your Honours will please {{to observe}} with what lenity we propose to treat these {{enormous}} offenders, {{who have already}} brought such a scandal on our honourable calling, that several well-meaning people have mistaken them to be of our Fraternity; in diminution to that credit and dignity wherewith we have supported our station, as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> in the worst of times.[183] And we further beg leave to remark, that this was manifestly done with a seditious design, to render us less capable of serving the public in any great employments, as several of our Fraternity, {{as well as our}} ancestors have done.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is the {{way with}} them always. They do all our work for us,--sailing either on one tack or the other. That is their use in creation, that when we split among ourselves, as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> {{they come in and}} finish our job for us. It must be {{unpleasant}} for them to be always doing that which they always say should never be done at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{stopped in}} {{this bit of}} a harbour for the night, Miss Rose, that is all;" [...] said Spike, observing that his fair {{passenger}} was looking about her, in some little surprise, at finding the vessel so near the land, and seemingly so much out of her proper position. [...] "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> that, when we first start on a v'y'ge, and before the brig gets used to travelling--do n't we, Mr. Mulford?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the way <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> {{on board}} ship," [...] {{observed}} Galleygo, {{to the group}} of domestics; [...] "whenever any thing of a hallooing character turns up. Sometimes we makes a signal to Admiral Blue and the rest on 'em, to 'stand by to cheer,' and all of us sets to, to cheer as if our stomachs was lull of hurrahs, and we wanted to get rid on 'em. If Sir Jarvy would just pass the word now, you'd have a taste of that 'ere custom, that would do your ears good for a twelvemonth. It's a cheering matter when the one of the trade falls heir to an estate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was standing," [...] writes Mr. Maxim, [...] "immediately between Lord Kitchener and Lord Wolsley (with Lord Roberts {{a little}} to the rear of us), and we were {{laughing}} and chatting as <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when the enemy were about to open fire on us. Suddenly we found ourselves the object of the most terrific hail of bullets. For a few moments the air was black with them. As they went past I could not refrain from exchanging a quiet smile with Lord Kitchener, and another with Lord Wolsley. Indeed I have never, except perhaps on twenty or thirty occasions, found myself exposed to such an awful fusillade.|$|R
