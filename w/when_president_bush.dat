Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time <b>when</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush’s</b> “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”. Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study.This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes {{as well as a}} large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.|$|R
