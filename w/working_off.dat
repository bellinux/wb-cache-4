Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E

However, Eisenhower limited the Board to clarifying the issues rather than recommending a settlement. Realizing that the strike could linger despite the provisions of Taft-Hartley, management offered a three-year contract with small improvements in pay and fringe benefits and binding arbitration over Section 2(b). McDonald rejected the offer. He proposed a contract similar to his proposal of early July, but reduced the union's wage and benefit demand and limited the contract to two rather than three years. <b>Working</b> <b>off</b> a plan devised by Goldberg, McDonald also proposed a nine-member committee consisting of three members from labor, management, and the public to study and resolve work-rule issues.

The nightclub in Blackpool was owned by Moore's friend, boxer Brian London. West Ham lost the tie 4–0. They were all fined a week's wages.

Its genus is Lopholatilus, which [...] is in the family Malacanthidae, commonly known as tilefish. The Malacanthidae {{are part of the}} Percoidea, a suborder of the order Perciformes. L. chamaeleonticeps gained its moniker [...] "great northern tilefish" [...] from its prodigious size and its discovery at relatively high latitudes for a member of the Malacanthidae. When used in cooking, the species is generally referred to as the [...] "golden tile", for the large yellow spots across its blue-green back and lighter-yellow or pink sides.

500|$|The pieces {{featured}} on Agharta {{were part of}} a typical set list for the group, but their performances of each sometimes changed almost beyond recognition from concert to concert. This, along with the track names, led to the widespread misunderstanding that the music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured. Lucas explained that the band started each performance with a [...] "very defined compositional basis" [...] before developing it further in a highly structured yet [...] "very free way"; the [...] "Right Off" [...] segment was improvised from the original recording's E-flat riff. Davis had the band play around a single chord in a piece for several minutes with variations as each member performed in a different time signature; Foster might have been playing in common time and Mtume in compound duple metre or septuple time, while the guitarists would comp in another tempo altogether. [...] "That's a lot of intricate shit we were <b>working</b> <b>off</b> this one chord", Davis remarked. From Lucas' perspective, this kind of [...] "structured improvisation" [...] resulted in significant interplay between the rhythm section and allowed the band to improvise [...] "a lot more than just the notes that were being played in the solos; we were improvising the entire song as we went along." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released.

Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people.

500|$|To {{supplement}} Hardy's endorsement, Gilbert Walker, {{a former}} mathematical lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging {{the young man}} to spend time at Cambridge.

Ross of Madras Christian College, whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, [...] "Does Ramanujan know Polish?" [...] The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail. In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. <b>Working</b> <b>off</b> Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.|$|E
