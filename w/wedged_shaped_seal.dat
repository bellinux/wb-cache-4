Recently, {{construction}} methods using gunpowder {{have been}} widely used to crush bedrock, concrete, etc. However, when these methods are used in urban areas, there can be negative safety and environmental effects. Therefore, there has been a growing demand for electric discharge shock crush, which is a static, non-blasting crush method that does not use gunpowder. This research aims to develop a method of controlling the crack direction during electric discharge shock crush. For the experiment, we used test pieces with a water-cement ratio of 55 %, a height of 200 mm, and a diameter of 100 mm. Then, we created four types of <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> to use on the test pieces, including a two-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> a three-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> (a downward <b>wedge</b> is added), a lateral disc <b>wedge</b> <b>shape,</b> and a four-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> (decahedron). For the discharge characteristics, the current and voltage waveforms had little difference between the test pieces, and it was confirmed that a larger waveform resulted from an increase in the charging voltage. Also, the two-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> could not control the crack direction. However, the three-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> could control a crack in the vertical direction and divide the test piece into two pieces. Thus, {{it is important to have}} a downward wedge (three-way wedge) to control the crack in the vertical direction. In addition, the lateral disc <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> generates a crack in the horizontal direction, and as a result, the test piece was sliced horizontally like a disc. Also, the four-way <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> cracked the test piece in the vertical and horizontal directions along the edges of the wedge. In conclusion, it was found that the <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> controls the crack directions...|$|R

50|$|Following the scherzo is a grand, slow {{third part}} which {{is roughly the}} length {{of the rest of the}} symphony.

This mysterious fugue is interrupted three times by a very sinister palindromic subject, again built out of the <b>wedge</b> <b>shape.</b> This palindromic subject is then used to form a basis for the variations that follow. These variations gradually build up in intensity to an enormous climax, which suddenly subsides to leave the note D# (which is used as a centre point rather than the tonality of the symphony) hanging in the air. Following this is a calm, peaceful coda in which the <b>wedge</b> <b>shape</b> is transformed into rising scales which give one the feeling of gazing into the infinite distances of space.|$|R
