40|$|The {{incidence}} of microbes in the nasal cavities {{of workers in}} three paper and board mills was investigated. A total of 234 persons exposed to microbial aerosols and splashes from paper machine wires and debarker drums formed the exposed group. The control group consisted of 294 workers from the dry working areas: the <b>winding</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> sections. Chi-square {{analysis was used to}} test the differences in the frequency of microbial incidence and various symptoms between the exposed and control groups. The nasal cavities of many workers, particularly workers in the debarkers, proved to be contaminated by Klebsiella pneumoniae, other coliforms, yeasts, and molds; usually only one microbe was involved, but sometimes two or several species were found. Nasal bacteria and yeasts were largely derived from the mill and debarker air; the microbes in the air came mainly from process waters. Lack of association of nasopharyngeal symptoms with either exposure to aerosols or nasal microbial contamination was interpreted as an indication of host defenses that were adequate to protect workers from harmful microbial colonization in paper mill environments...|$|E

50|$|Hurricanes {{draw their}} {{strength}} from the sea, so they quickly weaken {{and begin to}} dissipate when they make landfall. Hurricanes moving over fragmenting marshes toward the New Orleans area can retain more strength, <b>and</b> their <b>winds</b> <b>and</b> large waves <b>pack</b> more speed <b>and</b> destructive power. Scientists working for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources measured some of these effects during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Andrew's surge height dropped from 9.3 ft at Cocodrie to 3.3 ft at the Houma Navigation Canal 23 mi to the north. For every mile of the marsh-and-water landscape it traversed, it lost 3.1 inches of height, sparing some homes farther north from more flooding. Currently Louisiana has 30% of the total coastal marsh and accounts for 90% of the coastal marsh loss in the lower 48 states. The engineering of the river has basically brought the Gulf of Mexico much closer to New Orleans, making it more vulnerable to hurricanes.|$|R

W 7 -X continues the line of stellarator experiments at IPP. To allow for steady state operation W 7 -X has a superconducting coil system with 50 non-planar and 20 planar coils. The coil system is grouped in five equal modules, each consisting of two mirror symmetric half modules. The half modules are assembled from five different non-planar coils, two planar coils and a sector of the coil support structure. All cryogenic parts are enclosed in a cryostat {{to protect them from}} ambient temperature. The magnet system was ordered from the European industry.

As per SST- 1 mission mandate, all TF coils and PF 3 Top had been cold tested at full operational parameters. A dedicated large coil test facility was integrated for these tests. Specially adapted solutions such as magnet preparation cum transport stand, demountable busbar supports, demountable sensor mountings, reusable joints for busbar connections inside cryostat, etc., were developed. These measures led to timely and {{successful completion of}} cold tests and integration of the magnet system on to the SST- 1 machine shell. The functionality of various diagnostics of the magnet system was also established during these tests.

40|$|In {{moving towards}} ITER operation, the {{detailed}} analysis of fault conditions for the magnets becomes of increasing importance, to verify that the magnet protection system can safely manage them without any damage to the magnets. A "protected" Loss of Flow Accident in the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coils, de-tected by the coil flow meters and managed by the Central Inter-lock System, is investigated here using the validated thermal-hydraulic code 4 C. We simulate the entire sequence of events that is foreseen to protect the magnet, aiming at verifying {{the impact on the}} magnet. The LOFA consequences are investigated in terms of both the temperature margin in the <b>winding</b> <b>pack</b> <b>and</b> of the needed re-cooling time, which will affect the availability of the machine. It turns out that, for an "accelerated" discharge (i. e., a linear ramp-down) of the magnet current lasting less than 30 min, no quench should occur, while the corresponding re-cooling time should not exceed 1 h. During the transient, ~ 10 % of the He mass in the coil is vented to the quench tank due to the opening of the safety valves, and requires re-cooling...|$|R

40|$|The TF coils for ITER {{will use}} {{the concept of a}} {{circular}} thin walled Nb 3 Sn cable in conduit superconductor completely enclosed in an insulated groove in steel plates to form the coil pancakes. These are then stacked together to form the <b>winding</b> <b>pack</b> <b>and</b> supported by a AISI 316 LN stainless steel case. The concept is being demonstrated by the fabrication of a racetrack shaped model coil (TFMC) which is designed to operate mecanically, electrically and hydraulically in conditions representative for the ITER T F coils. For this purpose the TFMC will be assembled in the TOSKA facility at FZK Karlsruhe, together with the EURATOM LCT coil which provides an external field. The objectives of the TFMC are as follows: • to develop and verify the full scale TF coil manufacturing techniques; • to establish realistic manufacturing tolerances; • to bench-mark methods for the ITER TF coil acceptance; • to gain information on the coil's behaviour, operating margins and in-service monitoring techniques. The TFMC is actually in an advanced state of manufacture. Thus {{a large part of the}} first three objectives is reached. The TFMC will be delivered to FZK in summer 1999 to be prepared there for testing in TOSKA. Connected wit the ITER TFMC two other progammes are running in parallel, namely...|$|R
