5|$|The Roberts Drive campus <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> {{replaced}} with the Technology Drive campus, located off of KY 67 (Industrial Parkway) at the EastPark industrial park, which offers numerous industrial technology degrees that often reflect the job stock in the Ashland region that include programs in industrial maintenance, machine tool technology, electrical technology and welding. In addition to technical programs offered at the Technology Drive Campus, it also serves as the home for the college's Business and Industry Services.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

60|$|The {{obstacle}} {{arising out}} of conflicting opinions {{in regard to the}} patronage, one must be prepared for in every project of this kind. Mutual giving-way is indispensable, and I hope it <b>will</b> not <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> wanting in this case.|$|R
50|$|Some {{include this}} metaphor as {{description}} of the tactics of harassment. In such cases, a re-defining of another's goals may in reality be intentionally devised so as to assure that an athlete, for example, <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> never <b>be</b> able to finally achieve the ever shifting goals.|$|R
25|$|The Hubbert curve {{satisfies}} these constraints. Furthermore, it {{is roughly}} symmetrical, with {{the peak of}} production reached when {{about half of the}} fossil fuel that <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> produced has been produced. It also has a single peak.|$|E
25|$|The {{free trade}} {{agreement}} eliminates export and import duties {{on a number of}} goods but also contains a number of exemptions that <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> phased out. An agreement was also signed on the basic principles of currency regulation and currency controls in the CIS at the same October 2011 meeting.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of database analysis or data acquisition is the discovery of attribute dependencies; that is, we wish to discover which variables are strongly related to which other variables. Generally, it is these strong relationships that will warrant further investigation, and that <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> of use in predictive modeling.|$|E
50|$|Trapped in a hellish {{nightmare}} {{dimension and}} forced {{to serve as a}} bellhop to a world of non-European immigrants, Red Skull's <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>is</b> so great that he is able to escape his prison. As a result, Red Skull now possesses limited reality warping powers that make him a cosmic threat. He is further aided by Korvac, posing as Kang the Conqueror. He is sent to Galactus's ship to steal more power (in particular the power of omniscience), which would remove all limits to Red Skull's reality warping powers. Skull is ambushed by Korvac, who steals his cosmic powers and banishes him back to Earth.|$|R
50|$|The tram network {{currently}} operates using low-floor trams of {{the types}} NF6D (made by DÜWAG and similar to the R1.1 cars of Bonn tramway's system) and Variobahn (by Stadler Rail). Some lines still use type M high-floor articulated trams (also from DÜWAG), but these <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> also <b>be</b> replaced by Stadler Variobahns.|$|R

25|$|As the {{manuscript}} {{comes to a}} close, Chris explains that he is soon going to be reborn and will forget all that has happened. He ends with a message of hope, telling his readers that death {{is not to be}} feared, and that he knows that in the future he and Ann <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> reunited in Heaven, even if in different form.|$|E
25|$|The Naranja Town Site {{is also in}} the {{planning}} phase, and <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> the largest recreational park in Southern Arizona. The site plans include a performing arts center, aquatics center, recreational fields, tennis, basketball, tether ball, and volleyball courts, canine center, BMX and skate park. However, plans for this park have been put on hold due to the defeat of the bond issue in the November 2008 election.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 4 (T4), the Qantas terminal, is {{operated}} by Qantas Group and {{is dedicated to}} the domestic operations of Qantas, QantasLink & their budget subsidiary Jetstar. The terminal has four jetways and a total of nine gates. It has two member lounge, The Qantas Club, which was expanded in March 2013 to cater for an additional 140 passengers and the Qantas Domestic Business Lounge, which opened on 26 August 2014. The Perth Airport master plan outlines these terminals <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> demolished and replaced by new domestic facilities east of T1.|$|E
50|$|The metaphysical {{considerations}} {{of the existence}} of the supernatural can be difficult to approach as an exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis, the natural, <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> have to <b>be</b> inverted or rejected.|$|R
5000|$|Which {{features}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ultimately</b> adopted {{depends on}} the complete “ecology” of the contact situation, including factors such as demography, social relationships, and surface similarities between languages etc.|$|R
50|$|The mayor will be {{responsible}} for franchised bus services, allowing for standardised fares and branding on all bus services in the county, similar to how London's bus network operates. The mayor <b>will</b> also, <b>ultimately,</b> <b>be</b> responsible for management of the West Midlands Key Route Network, which is to be managed by Transport for West Midlands on behalf of the mayor.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} phase III {{clinical}} trials are reached, {{the formulation of}} the drug should {{have been developed to}} be close to the preparation that <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> used in the market. A knowledge of stability is essential by this stage, and conditions must have been developed to ensure that the drug is stable in the preparation. If the drug proves unstable, it will invalidate the results from clinical trials since {{it would be impossible to}} know what the administered dose actually was. Stability studies are carried out to test whether temperature, humidity, oxidation, or photolysis (ultraviolet light or visible light) have any effect, and the preparation is analysed to see if any degradation products have been formed.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> able to help us to do.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E

40|$|But {{technology}} <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> and usefully <b>be</b> {{better served}} by following the spirit of Eddington, by attempting to provide enough time and intellectual space {{for those who want}} to invest themselves in exploration of levels beyond the genome independently of any quick promises for still quicker solutions to extremely complex problems. ...|$|R
25|$|The Declaration of Montreal on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Human Rights is a {{document}} adopted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on July 29, 2006, by the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights which formed {{part of the}} first World Outgames. The Declaration outlines a number of rights and freedoms pertaining to LGBT and intersex people that it is proposed be universally guaranteed. It encompasses all aspects of human rights, from the guarantee of fundamental freedoms to the prevention of discrimination against LGBT people in healthcare, education and immigration. The Declaration also addresses various issues that impinge on the global promotion of LGBT rights and intersex human rights. Intended as a starting point in listing the demands of the international LGBT movement, it <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> submitted to the United Nations.|$|E

500|$|At {{the present}} time the apiary is used {{exclusively}} for research on native pollinator decline and ecology, with the last beekeeping classes taught at the university nearly a decade ago. The building is currently on the university's [...] "defer and do not reinvest list", suggesting that it <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> dismantled {{at some point in}} the near future.|$|E
5000|$|The {{justification}} for the two layers of models {{over and above the}} information model is that if data set definitions consist of pre-defined data points from a library of such definitions, then all recorded data (i.e. instances of templates) <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> just <b>be</b> instances of the standard content definitions. This provides a basis for standardised querying to work. Without the archetype [...] "library" [...] level, every data set (i.e. chunk of operational content) is uniquely defined and a standard approach to querying is difficult.|$|R
50|$|Baley {{returns to}} Earth a hero. Asked by his boss to reveal any {{weaknesses}} he found, Baley {{says that the}} features once regarded as Spacer strengths, such as their robots and long lives, <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> prove to <b>be</b> weaknesses. They discourage an active, exploratory attitude that Earth-born humans will eventually rediscover once {{they are able to}} leave Earth.|$|R

The companies that <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> do well <b>are</b> the companies that chase happiness. If you {{find a way to}} help people find love, or health or friendship, the dollar will chase that.” ...|$|R
500|$|The sysinstall utility is now {{considered}} deprecated in favor of bsdinstall, a new installer which was introduced in FreeBSD 9.0. bsdinstall is [...] "a lightweight replacement for sysinstall" [...] that was written in sh.

A planning study will identify future interchange locations and a twinning plan for the approximately [...] stretch of the highway between Fort McMurray and the Peter Lougheed Bridge near Fort MacKay that remains undivided. [...] Like the majority of the corridor, this section <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> a six-lane freeway.

500|$|On 15 May 1862 {{the book}} was {{published}} under the full title of On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. In August, Darwin was [...] "well contented with the sale of 768 copies; I shd. hope & expect that the remainder <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> sold", but the book sold slowly and less than 2,000copies of the first edition were printed. An expanded edition translated into French was published in Paris in 1870, and in 1877 Murray brought out a revised and expanded second edition, with the shortened title The various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects. This was also published by D. Appleton & Company of New York in 1877, and a German translation {{was published in the}} same year. Despite being well praised by botanists, only about 6,000copies of the English editions had been sold by 1900.|$|E

40|$|Bullying is {{physical}} and or psychological abuse perpetuated by one powerful child upon another, {{with the intention}} to harm or dominate. Bullying and aggression in schools has reached epidemic proportions. Abusive bullying behaviors begin in elementary school, peak during middle school, and begin to subside in high school. Bullying behaviors are associated with catastrophic violence. Cyberbullying has emerged as one result of the increasingly online social life in which modern teens and children engage. Mediation may be inappropriate. The only safety mechanism that children <b>will</b> <b>ultimately</b> retain <b>is</b> the one between their ears...|$|R
