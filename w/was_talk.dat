During his tenure in the Senate, Brown served on the Council of State from June 23, 1895 through 1901, and on the Senate Judiciary, Coinage, and Foreign Relations committees. In November 1904, though nominated, Brown was not re-elected. There <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of Brown running again in the general elections of 1906 and 1908, but in 1910 he was re-elected.

5|$|Tor Nessling {{resigned}} from Yhteissisu in February 1947. There <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of closing the company. Yhteissisu sold only 103 S-22s in 1947, {{some of which}} had been produced the previous year. 55 lorries were built by the company in 1947. The company's share capital was reduced from 75millionmarks to 7.5million, then increased to 50million; the state became the main owner, having a 44% share of the company. The other owners were Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat, A. Ahlström, Strömberg and Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus. From September, the new general manager of the company was Eero Kytölä. The company lost two million marks in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nevelson's death her {{estate was}} {{worth at least}} $100 million. Her son, Mike Nevelson, removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works, worth millions, to her friend and {{assistant}} of 25 years Diana MacKown, yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise. Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers, MacKown maintained {{that she had never}} had a sexual relationship with Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E
5|$|After England {{lost the}} first three Tests (which {{included}} a 46 all out in the second innings of the third Test) there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of another blackwash series.

This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting nation had won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series was to come in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375. Lara was congratulated by Sobers, who was present on the ground to see his record broken.|$|E

5|$|Although Joachim von Ribbentrop {{had been}} named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring {{continued}} to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government {{with the idea that}} he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or {{near the bottom of}} the league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of keeping {{him in the}} rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher {{was still able to}} contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world.

Bebel <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> German.

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1860–1861, there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> {{throughout}} the region of a possible of war with the South, but Indianapolis had only four militia groups ready to fight: the National Guards, the City Greys, the Indianapolis Independent Zouaves, and the Zouave Guards. On January 7, 1861, the Indianapolis Zouaves volunteered for service if Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, requested it, {{but they were not}} needed until spring. On February 11, 1861, president-elect Abraham Lincoln arrived in Indianapolis, one of several train stops he made en route to Washington, D.C., for his presidential inauguration. The pre-inauguration stop made Lincoln the first president-elect to visit Indianapolis. Two months later, the United States was on the brink of war.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC {{over the issue of}} whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> of calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Nash was {{immediately}} appointed captain of Camberwell and quickly {{became one of}} the most popular figures in the VFA, drawing large crowds to even practice matches. Playing mainly at centre-half-back in his first season but later in the forward-line, Nash was runner-up in the 1938 Camberwell Best and Fairest and won the 1939 Best and Fairest; and in 1939, he finished second in both of the VFA's Best and Fairest awards: the Recorder Cup and VFA Medal. Nash spent four seasons at Camberwell, where he played 74 games and kicked 418 goals, including 100 in 1939 and 141 in 1941. At the start of the 1940 season Nash was still considered amongst the best footballers in the country and, with the transfer of former South Melbourne team mate Bob Pratt and Collingwood full-forward Ron Todd to rival VFA sides Coburg and Williamstown respectively, there <b>was</b> <b>talk</b> that the VFA would now match the VFL for crowds.|$|E
