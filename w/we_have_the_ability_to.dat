This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways {{with the other}} co-founder of Perfect Image, Anthony Pérez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records. Filtro Musik's concept {{initially}} stemmed from its name which means [...] "filter" [...] in English. Guadalupe explained the title, saying [...] "I've been in this industry for 15 years now, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> filter and pick the best". In the coming year, Univision Music Group signed the label to licensing plan to release the album in September 2005, which ensured that the [...] "album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product." [...] Ivy Queen was previously married to fellow reggaeton artist Omar Navarro, known by his stage name Gran Omar. They were divorced in 2005 shortly before the release of Flashback, which influenced {{the composition of the}} album. She denied ever having found him in the act of adultery, while claiming that if she had found Navarro with another woman, she'd be in La Vega Alta, a prison for women in Puerto Rico. She also denied rumors that she had physically assaulted the woman she caught with Navarro. She stated they had not lived with each other for two months citing the [...] "extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer" [...] as being causes {{to the end of the}} nine-year marriage.|$|E

2500|$|The Lucifer Effect {{was written}} in {{response}} to his findings in the Stanford Prison Experiment. Zimbardo believes that personality characteristics could play a role in how violent or submissive actions are manifested. In the book, Zimbardo says that humans cannot be defined as good or evil because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> act as both especially at the hand of the situation. Examples include the events that occurred at the Abu Ghraib Detention Center, in which the defense team—including Gary Myers—argued that it was not the prison guards and interrogators that were at fault for the physical and mental abuse of detainees but the Bush administration policies themselves. According to Zimbardo, [...] "Good people can be induced, seduced, and initiated into behaving in evil ways. They can also be led to act in irrational, stupid, self-destructive, antisocial, and mindless ways when they are immersed in 'total situations' that impact human nature in ways that challenge our sense of the stability and consistency of individual personality, of character, and of morality." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Leibniz, [...] "God is an {{absolutely}} perfect being." [...] He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of {{something with the}} most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection [...] "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" [...] (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: [...] "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are [...] "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" [...] because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says {{that the only way}} we can truly love God is by being content [...] "with all that comes to us according to his will" [...] (IV).|$|E

2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> get a PS3 team together, until we find {{the people who want}} to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E

It was claimed that the special forces command was in the highest stage of readiness for an attack (state G) in December of the following year. Ariel Sharon reportedly said, [...] "Israel - and not only Israel - cannot accept a nuclear Iran. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deal with this and we're making all the necessary preparations to be ready for such a situation."
