25|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the former}} Hughes Aircraft hangars at Hughes Airport, {{including}} the one that held the Hercules, were converted into sound stages. Scenes from movies such as Titanic, What <b>Women</b> <b>Want</b> and End of Days have been filmed in the 315,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) aircraft hangar where Howard Hughes created the flying boat. The hangar will be preserved as a structure eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Buildings in what is today the large light industry and housing development in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Barnes {{immersed}} {{herself in}} risky situations {{in order to}} access experiences that a previous generation of homebound women had been denied. Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of boxing from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as a window into women's modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question “What do <b>women</b> <b>want</b> at a fight?” in an article titled “My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight” published in New York World magazine. According to Irene Gammel, “Barnes’ essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women”.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Gibson {{acted in}} three films that each grossed over $100million: The Patriot, Chicken Run, and What <b>Women</b> <b>Want.</b> In 2002, Gibson {{appeared}} in the Vietnam War drama We Were Soldiers and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson's acting career. While promoting Signs, Gibson said {{that he no longer}} wanted to be a movie star and would only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson appeared in Edge of Darkness, which marked his first starring role since 2002 and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, Edge of Darkness. In 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson was dropped from the talent agency of William Morris Endeavor.|$|E
25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these <b>women</b> <b>want</b> to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it is understandable that how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and make them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E

25|$|Midler {{starred in}} her own sitcom in 2000, Bette, which {{featured}} Midler playing herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing on CBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show's cancellation in early 2001. Midler openly griped about the show's demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-star Kevin Dunn whose departure was attributed to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler by the media. However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded a People's Choice Award for her performance in the show and received a Golden Globe Award nomination the following year. Also in 2000, Midler made an uncredited cameo appearance in Nancy Meyers' fantasy rom–com What <b>Women</b> <b>Want,</b> starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women's thoughts. Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.|$|E

President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau sent letters of appreciation for her service. The New York Times carried word of her retirement, but no interview, and a week later editorialized that [...] "there is modernity here, too. [...] An answer to America's challenge to women.

500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most <b>women</b> <b>want</b> to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E
500|$|Lansky was {{disappointed}} with the track, and wrote in his Idolator article that [...] "Aura" [...] consisted of all [...] "the best and worst things about Lady Gaga amplified"; it was [...] "weird and frustrating and great and terrible and brilliant and a failure all at once". Umema Aimem of The Washington Post criticized the song's lyrics: [...] "The song actually started out well ... but then you lost me when you proceeded to turn such a sacred symbol of [...] into an exotic costume". Mark Hogan of Spin called it [...] "a grasping EDM mess" [...] and [...] "all over the place"; he disliked the burqa lyrics, [...] "along with plenty of moments that bring to mind all the 'blog house' producers following {{in the path of}} Crystal Castles or Simian Mobile Disco circa 2007". Max Kessler of Paper gave [...] "Aura" [...] a lukewarm review; the song had [...] "all the classic Gaga attributes", including [...] "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible". Its lyrics were controversial, with some Muslims accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it. According to Aimem, [...] "Auras lyrics imply that <b>women</b> <b>want</b> to flirt with men; this contradicts Gaga's previous song, [...] "Monster", in which she condemns date rape.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Grady Smith for Entertainment Weekly described its lyricism as [...] "terribly misguided" [...] for One Direction's target audience. Melinda Newman of HitFix, polarised by its lyrical content, wrote that <b>women</b> <b>want</b> men to pretend their flaws {{do not exist}} and not see them. Both Kate Wills of The Independent and Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan criticised the lyrical content as jarring. Although Bill Lamb of About.com shared Smith's sentiment, he favoured Gosling's [...] "beautiful" [...] production of the song and the group's [...] "top notch" [...] vocal performance. Al Fox of BBC Music, who noted a [...] "pursuit for credibility", felt that One Direction were [...] "handing in their identity" [...] with [...] "Little Things". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times dismissed Sheeran's songwriting as [...] "unusually lumpy {{in the hands of}} such a polished group". In contrast, Alexis Petridis for The Guardian described the track as [...] "noticeably more sophisticated lyrically and emotionally than anything else on the album." [...] The Boston Globe editor Sarah Rodman selected the [...] "essential" [...] song as the album's [...] "best" [...] attribute, and Matt Collar from AllMusic considered the ballad [...] "an air of maturity to One Direction's admittedly squeaky-fresh sound." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt that [...] "Little Things" [...] can be interpreted as [...] "minor signs of growth" [...] for the boy band.|$|E
