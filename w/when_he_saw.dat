5|$|Native Americans {{also used}} {{the area around the}} Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners {{eventually}} reached the area in the 1870s-1890s, searching for resources and rich land.

5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu.

5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career.

He was still unsure what to do, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E

There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between {{the two sets of}} supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns {{mounted on the}} centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong {{as that of the}} Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E

5|$|Grant quickly {{raised and}} {{recruited}} {{a company of}} volunteers, and was given the captaincy, accompanying them to Springfield. He perceived that the war would be fought mostly by volunteers, not career soldiers. Governor Richard Yates offered Grant a militia commission to recruit and train volunteer units, which he accepted, but still wanted a field command. He made several efforts through his professional contacts. Major General George B. McClellan refused to see him, remembering the day in Oregon in 1853 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Grant on a drunken spree. With the aid of his advocate, Representative Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, Grant was promoted to Colonel on June 14 and charged with disciplining the unruly 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Transferred to northern Missouri, Grant was promoted to Brigadier General, backdated to May 17, 1861.|$|E
5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E

NG was acquired by Artemis Records toward the end of 1999, and producer Garth Richardson obtained the band's demo. Kittie recorded Spit, produced by Richardson, at EMAC Studios in London, Ontario. Mercedes Lander said that Spit was recorded in nine days.|$|E
