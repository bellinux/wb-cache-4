5|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 40years {{before the}} first {{crossing}} of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} in Siberia, Eichelberger {{was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1919. Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had {{other members of the}} Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first hand, and he was impressed by what he saw of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a match for American troops. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was withdrawn in April 1920.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 88 points, ahead of Mika Häkkinen on 80 points and David Coulthard on 63. Rubens Barrichello was fourth on 55 points, with Ralf Schumacher fifth on 24 points. A maximum of 20 points were {{available}} for the final two races, which meant Häkkinen could still win the title. Michael Schumacher only needed to clinch victory in the race, regardless of where Häkkinen finished, Schumacher <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> ten points ahead of Häkkinen with one race remaining. Otherwise, Häkkinen could win the Championship in the final race {{of the season in}} Malaysia by out-scoring his rival. In the event of a points tie, Michael Schumacher would win the Championship on count-back, having more wins. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading on 143 points, McLaren and Williams were second and third on 133 and 34 points respectively, while Benetton with 20 and Jordan with 17 contended for fourth place. Championship drivers Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella had each gained second-place finishes while Ralf Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had both achieved third place podium finishes.|$|E

5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> happy to accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

25|$|With {{the basic}} need of shelter {{immediately}} settled, {{a short period}} of energetic growth and relative prosperity followed. Farmland was rented, a saw mill and flour mill opened, workshops established, and schools and a theater founded. A periodical press was launched, publishing in French, English, and German, and an office was established in Paris to recruit adherents for the American colony. The Nauvoo cultural life thrived. The Icarians held regular band concerts and theatre productions. Their library consisted of an extensive collection, ranging from reference works to applied science to popular novels, all in English and French, and totaling over 4,000 volumes. By 1855 there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500 participants in the Icarian project.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Montreal {{experienced}} a tremendous economic boom. Massive construction projects, including the Montreal Metro and those {{linked with the}} hosting of Expo 67, brought the city international status. More and more visitors were arriving to the city, especially by airplane but not always by choice. The federal government required European airlines to make Montreal their only Canadian destination. That resulted in 15–20% annual growth in passenger traffic at the city's Dorval Airport. Optimistic about the city's future and its continuing ability to attract more and more visitors, government officials decided {{to build a new}} airport that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> able to absorb increased passenger traffic well into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|India is the fourth-largest civil {{aviation}} {{market in the}} world recording an air traffic of 131 million passengers in 2016. The market is estimated to have 800 aircraft by 2020. In 2015, Boeing projected India's demand for aircraft to touch 1,740, valued at $240 billion, over the next 20 years. This would account for 4.3 per cent of global volumes. According to Airbus, India {{will be one of the}} top three aviation markets in the next 20 years. Airbus is expecting an annual growth rate of over 11 per cent for the domestic market over the next ten years, while the combined growth rate for domestic and international routes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 per cent.|$|E
25|$|As the prototypes took shape, the {{exterior}} lines resembled {{more of a}} Ferrari or Porsche than a typical GM car, but the tight budget was taking its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti's dream of a high performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{the production of the}} whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny car so it was equipped with a smaller oil pan, causing the engine to always run a quart low.|$|E

25|$|Succession to the {{chieftain}}ship or kingship {{was through}} tanistry. When a man became chieftain or king, a relative {{was elected to}} be his deputy or 'tanist' (Irish: tánaiste, plural tanaistí). When the chieftain or king died, his tanist would automatically succeed him. The tanist had to share the same great-grandfather as his predecessor (i.e. was of the same derbfine) and he was elected by freemen who also shared the same great-grandfather. Tanistry meant that the kingship usually went to whichever relative was deemed {{to be the most}} fitting. Sometimes there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one tanist at a time and they would succeed each other in order of seniority. Some Anglo-Norman lordships later adopted tanistry from the Irish.|$|E
25|$|In January 1914, {{his closest}} friend and coworker Joseph Keiley died, which left him distraught for many weeks. He was also {{troubled by the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I for several reasons. He {{was concerned about the}} safety of family and friends in Germany. He needed to find a new printer for the photogravures for Camera Work, which had been printed in Germany for many years. The war caused a significant downturn in the American economy and art became a luxury for many people. By the end of the year, Stieglitz was struggling to keep both 291 and Camera Work alive. He published the April issue of Camera Work in October, but it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year before he had the time and resources to publish the next issue.|$|E
25|$|The final HZ Sandman, {{featured}} {{a choice of}} V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0-litre V8 engine and a limited slip differential. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, the price <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 150percent {{of the cost of}} the basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture—order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured around October 1979.|$|E
