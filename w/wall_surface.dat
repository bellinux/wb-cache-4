25|$|The {{main house}} has a balloon-frame {{structure}} on a concrete foundation. The roof is flat with a parapet wall running along the roof edge to conceal the asphalt roof. There is a large overhanging eave on the northeast front and north sides of the building. The exterior is covered with spatter-dashed stucco. The living room picture windows are casement style, set at a 110 degree angle. The remaining windows are a two-over-two double-hung type with horizontal muntins. The original doors were replaced in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the originals doors so an appropriate Streamline Moderne style door with a round port window was installed during the 1996 renovation. The street front façade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main <b>wall</b> <b>surface</b> that emphasize the design’s horizontal orientation.|$|E
25|$|The central bay of {{the south}} facade of the Hartington City Hall and Auditorium is highly {{effective}} Prairie School architecture (the nearly hidden north facade is similar). The bulk of the <b>wall</b> <b>surface</b> is simple running bond brickwork, forming a uniform ground for the interplay of horizontal and vertical lines. The stone coping at the roofline forms the highest horizontal line. Not far below is a horizontal band of triple corbelling that surrounds the building. This effect is created by projecting three courses of brick out farther than the wall below (as in a corbel), repeating it with three more courses of brick, and then repeating it again for the entire rest of the wall up to the copestone. Steele adds depth and interest to this band by varying the projection {{of each of the}} three brick courses by facade so that corners highlight one or another course (see photo below). This effective horizontal band is similar to but more sophisticated than what Steele used near the top of his noted First Congregational Church (Sioux City, 1916–1918). Additional horizontal lines derive from the original three bands of windows (particularly prior to more recent window alterations). These consistent horizontal lines are dramatically emphasized by the strong counterpoint of the six vertical piers. Yet even these vertical pilasters have horizontal elements in their capitals, consisting of three horizontal bands of projecting brick string courses (which echo the triple corbelling above) and the contrasting capitals of cast stone on top. Across the set of six vertical piers or pilasters along the auditorium, these elements create additional horizontal lines.|$|E

Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from the pressure of crowded spores within.

Many designers were employed as the cathedral has {{a series of}} chapels, each different in concept. Lord Brampton, a recent convert to Roman Catholicism, selected Clayton and Bell to fill his commission for an altarpiece for the Chapel of Saints Augustine and Gregory, representing the conversion of England to Christianity. Clayton designed the mosaics in much {{the way that he}} designed stained glass, in a Victorian Gothic manner, but with a gold background, traditional to the ancient mosaics of Venice. Although the work was to be assembled by Salviati’s workshop on Murano, the tiles were English, having been made by a technique developed by the stained glass firm of James Powell and Sons and manufactured by that firm. Clayton despatched the cartoons and the tiles to Venice, where the expert mosaicists selected and glued them face down to the drawing, a technique said to have been devised by Salviati. The tiles were then adhered to the <b>wall</b> <b>surface</b> and the paper removed, leaving the mosaic intact. Lord Brampton died in 1907, to be commemorated by a mosaic of the “Just Judge”.

A buttress acting in this way must be of perfectly coherent materials, and so strong that though the weight to be borne could easily move it, it cannot break it: this kind of buttress may be called a conducting buttress. Practically, however, the two modes of action are always in some sort united. Again, the weight to be borne may either act generally on the whole <b>wall</b> <b>surface,</b> or with excessive energy on particular points: when it acts on the whole <b>wall</b> <b>surface,</b> the whole wall is generally supported; and the arrangement becomes a continuous rampart, as a dyke, or bank of reservoir.|$|E

The bioassays were performed by exposing 2 - 5 days old unfed susceptible female Anopheles gambiae s. s. (Kisumu strain) to sprayed <b>wall</b> <b>surfaces</b> for a period of 30 minutes. In each sentinel village, mosquito collection was carried out by trained community mosquito collectors. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from 6. 00 pm to 6. 00 am using CDC light traps and clay pot methods for indoors host seekingand outdoors resting mosquitoes respectively. Six traps (2 CDC light traps and 4 clay pots) were set per sentinel village per night for 28 consecutive days in a moon. PCR and ELISA were used for mosquito species identification and sporozoite detection, respectively. Based on the WHOPES recommendation, insecticides should have a minimum efficacy of ≥ 80 % mosquito mortality at 24 hours post exposure on the sprayed <b>wall</b> <b>surfaces</b> to be considered effective. In this study, p-methyl 300 CS was demonstrated to have a long residual efficacy of 21 - 43 weeks post-IRS on mud, cement, painted and wood <b>wall</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Numberof anopheline mosquitoes decreased post-IRS interventions in all sentinel villages. The highest numbers ofanopheline mosquitoes were collected in November-December, 38 - 43 weeks post-IRS. A total of 270 female anopheline mosquitoes were analyzed by PCR; out of which 236 (87. 4 %) were An. gambiae s. l. and 34 (12. 6 %) were An. funestus group. Of the 236 An. gambiae s. l. identified 12. 6 % (n = 34) were An. gambiae s. s. and 68. 6 % (n = 162) were An. arabiensis.

The northern architect neither knew the ancient work, nor possessed the delicate material; and he had no resource but to cover his walls with holes, cut into foiled shapes like those of the windows. This he did, often with great clumsiness, but always with a vigorous sense of composition, and always, observe, depending on the shadows for effect. Where the wall was thick and could not be cut through, and the foilings were large, those shadows did not fill the entire space; but the form was, nevertheless, drawn on the eye by means of them, and when it was possible, they were cut clear through, as in raised screens of pediment, like those on the west front of Bayeux; cut so deep in every case, as to secure, in all but a direct low front light, great breadth of shadow.|$|E
