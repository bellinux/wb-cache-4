5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{party had}} survived major setbacks, {{including}} several prolonged illnesses which had curtailed their earning powers. Although Leopold {{did not reveal}} {{the full extent of}} the tour's earnings, or its expenses, the material benefits from the tour had evidently been considerablebut so had the costs. The librarian of St Peter's Abbey, Salzburg, thought that the gifts ("gewgaws") alone which they brought back were worth about 12,000 florins, but estimated the total costs of the enterprise at 20,000 florins. The expenses were certainly high; in a letter to Hagenauer sent in September 1763, after ten weeks on the road, Leopold reported expenses to date as 1,068 florins, an amount covered by their concert earnings without, however, any significant surplus. Leopold stated that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved, because we have to travel in noble or courtly style for the preservation of our health and the reputation of my court".

500|$|In late 1730, {{news came}} to Paraguay {{that a third}} {{replacement}} governor was on the way, Ignacio de Soroeta. [...] Rumors spread that Soroeta {{was a friend of}} the Jesuits and Reyes. [...] Mompó rallied his followers, called the comuneros, and raised a force of 300 outside the city. [...] A delegation of the comuneros sent to the cabildo demanded that the new governor be denied entry. [...] Barúa demanded that the comuneros disband; when they refused, he resigned his post in frustration. [...] The comuneros demanded new elections of the cabildo, which, unsurprisingly, they won. [...] Only those members who had accepted the rebel line were re-elected, while the other cabildo members were replaced by comuneros. [...] When Soroeta arrived, he was informed he was not wanted, and only allowed to stay in Asunción for four days under virtual house arrest. [...] Convinced there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, Soroeta left; Barúa and Bishop Palos of Asunción also left. [...] The city was entirely under comunero control. [...] Despite the new comunero influence on the cabildo, Mompó desired an even more radical shift. [...] He apparently felt that he could not abolish the cabildo directly; instead, he created his own parallel governmental structure, [...] the Junta Gobernativa, whose members were elected by the people.|$|E

The Suffolk constabulary file on the case was released in 2005 under the UK’s Freedom of Information Act and can be accessed on their website. It includes a letter dated 28 July 1999 written by Inspector Mike Topliss who notes that one of the police constables who attended the scene on the first night returned to the site in daylight in case he had missed something. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen and he remains unconvinced that the occurrence was genuine," [...] wrote Topliss.

2500|$|McCulloch was {{the editor}} of The Scotsman of Edinburgh; he replied cuttingly in a review printed {{on the front page}} of his {{newspaper}} in March, 1827. He implied that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly felt his ox gored, and his review of Definitions is largely a bitter defence of his own Principles of Political Economy, and his counter-attack [...] "does little credit to his reputation", being largely [...] "personal derogation" [...] of Malthus. The purpose of Malthus's Definitions was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus's work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained [...] "by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to" [...] words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch's review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus's critiques of other writers.|$|E
