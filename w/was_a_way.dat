5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking). The funeral ale <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or {{the master of the}} homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E

5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} several reasons. Firstly, her selection showed that the government truly respected women's contributions to the nationalist movement. Secondly, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for Sjahrir {{to show that the}} Indonesian people were committed to the needs of their people, by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage {{by mutual agreement}} that probably {{began in the late}} 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E

After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career.
