5|$|During her London winter, Potter {{developed}} her work, and, by {{the middle}} of June 1904, Benjamin Bunny was almost finished. Many of the sketches from her Fawe Park holiday were little altered in their migration to the book, and, upon completion of the work, Potter declared she <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> be finished with the rabbits.|$|E
5|$|The ANGAU Detachment {{reached the}} town of Mokerang on 9 March and found fifty inhabitants. The Detachment <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find islanders had not been {{deliberately}} ill-treated by the Japanese. The retreating Japanese had stripped their gardens of food, leaving the civilian population hungry, so ANGAU arranged {{for them to be}} provisioned by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March, news of Victor's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Barrosa reached Soult {{and he left}} Badajoz to return to Andalusia, anxious that the siege of Cádiz had been lifted. Reaching Seville on 20 March he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find that Victor's siege lines still held and Andalusia {{remained}} under French control. Before his departure Soult had consolidated his gains in Extremadura by garrisoning Badajoz with 11,000 French troops {{under the command of}} Marshal Édouard Mortier.|$|E

5|$|Sarah <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> {{move back}} to England. The Duke of Marlborough {{became one of the}} king's close advisers, and Sarah moved back into Marlborough House, where she flaunted her eldest granddaughter, Lady Henrietta Godolphin, in the hope of finding a {{suitable}} marriage partner. Henrietta eventually married Thomas Pelham-Holles, first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, the Kulikovskys {{travelled}} to London by Danish troopship. They were {{housed in}} a grace-and-favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants. On 2 June 1948, Kulikovsky, Olga, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guri and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guri and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's companion and former maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka") departed Liverpool on board the Empress of Canada. After a rough crossing, the ship docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The family proceeded to Toronto, where they lived until they purchased a 200-acre (0.8km2) farm in Halton County, Ontario, near Campbellville. Kulikovsky <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> move out of Toronto, and escape media attention.|$|E

5|$|The ballet {{was first}} {{shown in the}} United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine's 1920 version was {{performed}} by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski, with Martha Graham dancing {{the role of the}} Chosen One. The production moved to New York, where Massine <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously. The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, Terra Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|After L'Enfant departed, Ellicott {{continued}} the city survey {{in accordance with}} his revised plan, several larger and more detailed versions of which were also engraved, published, printed and distributed. As a result, Ellicott's revisions {{became the basis for}} the capital city's future development. When he later quit the City of Washington project, Ellicott <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> escape the political pressures surrounding that venture.|$|E

25|$|Two schoolfriends, who {{had also}} been {{evacuated}} from Singapore to Batavia, heard that Gorton was in hospital, arranged {{for them to be}} put on a ship for Fremantle, which left on 23 February and treated Gorton's wounds. When the ship arrived in Fremantle, on 3 March, one of Gorton's arm wounds had become septic and needed extensive treatment. However, he was more concerned about the effect that the sight of his mutilated face would have on his wife. It is reported that Betty Gorton, who had been running the farm in his absence, <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> see Gorton alive.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she heard the sound of gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> see that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
25|$|During {{a show in}} November 2013 on Black Flag's Australian tour, pro skater {{and band}} manager Mike Vallely, who {{previously}} sang with the band in 2003, came on stage, took Reyes' microphone, ousted him from Black Flag and sang the band's last two songs, Reyes said he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> {{be removed from the}} band citing difficulties working with Ginn. In January 2014, Vallely was named the band's new lead singer. Vallely apologized for the band's antics in 2013 and revealed that the band had begun working on material for a new album with a tour to tentatively begin in May. Shortly after the announcement, Dave Klein announced he too was leaving the band. In 2014, Ginn filled out the line up with adding new members Tyler Smith on bass, and Brandon Pertzborn on drums. Black Flag has been inactive since the completion of their 2014 tour. The offshoot band Flag however, continues to play shows.|$|E

25|$|Banting and Best {{presented}} their results to Macleod {{on his return}} to Toronto {{in the fall of}} 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He then supplied Banting and Best with a better laboratory, and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success; and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However, six weeks required to extract the isletin forced considerable delays. Banting suggested they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands; he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the extract. In December 1921, Macleod invited the biochemist James Collip to help with this task, and, within a month, the team felt ready for a clinical test.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} intervening, between finding Bridger and finding Fitzgerald, Glass and four others were {{dispatched}} in February 1824 with mail for Fort Atkinson. They traveled up the Powder River, then {{across to the}} Platte River. There they constructed skin boats and traveled down the Platte River to {{the lower end of}} the Black Hills. Glass and his party discovered a settlement of 38 lodges of Arikara. Their leader, who was known by Glass, declared the tribe to be friendly and invited them in so the men went ashore. While smoking with him in his lodge, Glass noticed their equipment being taken by the residents and realized it was a trap. The men quickly fled but two were killed by the pursuing war party. Glass managed to hide behind some rocks until the Arikara gave up their search, but was separated from the two other survivors. He <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find his knife and flint in his shot pouch and traveled to Fort Kiowa surviving off the land.|$|E
500|$|At the March NFL Combine, Streets ran {{the third}} fastest 40-yard dash {{in a time}} of 4.42 seconds. Streets was {{regarded}} as between the 6th and 8th best wide receiver in the 1999 NFL Draft according to most expert analyses in April. [...] However, he ruptured his right achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game prior to the draft and was expected to be sidelined for six to eight months. As a result, he was the twentieth wide receiver selected. [...] Streets, who was on crutches {{at the time of the}} draft, <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> have been drafted.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, LBC&W {{designed}} {{and began to}} build a new office complex at 1321 Bull Street to accommodate its continuously growing staff. The architects <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> leave the cramped conditions of the rooms above McGregor's Drug Store.|$|R
5000|$|As an Israeli once wrote, [...] "I admire your {{cartoonist}} M. Kahil. He {{has such}} an incisive, unassuming style. A style {{that is so}} lacking in our miserable region. It <b>is</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>to</b> find that the 'enemy' is human." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{caused more}} cheering, for the workmen had {{suspected}} that the new hands would be voted illegally, and they <b>were</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find {{that it was a}} [...] "square deal all 'round," [...] as one of them remarked with satisfaction.|$|R
500|$|The jury's foreman assured Robert Dudley in {{a letter}} of his own that for all they could find out, it {{appeared}} to be an accident. Dudley, desperately seeking to avert damage from what he called [...] "my case", <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> hear the impending outcome, but thought [...] "another substantial company of honest men" [...] should undertake a further investigation [...] "for more knowledge of truth". This panel should include any available friends of Lady Amy's and her half-brothers John Appleyard and Arthur Robsart, both of whom he had ordered to Cunmor immediately after Amy's death. Nothing came of this proposal.|$|E
500|$|Bagley, {{unaware of}} Rose's {{humanitarian}} gesture, left {{most of the}} food, water, and medical supplies with Lieutenant Commander John K.

Bagley, Lieutenant Commander Norman Scott (Jacob Jones executive officer) and four crewmen (brought along to row), set out for aid in the nearby Isles of Scilly. At 13:00 on 7December, Bagley's group was sighted by a British patrol vessel just six nautical miles (11km) from their destination. The group <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> find that the British sloop [...] had found and taken aboard most of the survivors earlier that morning; a small group had been rescued {{on the night of the}} sinking by the American steamer [...]|$|E
500|$|Curteis {{ran into}} several {{problems}} while directing the film. Owing to his absence of feature film experience, the film's tight schedule, and limited funding, he became quickly overwhelmed, and The Projected Man started going over its budget and falling behind on schedule. Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened {{to take over}} production as {{they did not want}} to increase the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that [...] "I think Curteis <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> step out because he simply didn't know any longer what to do." [...] Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film; as Gordon said, [...] "one tries not to publicize such incidents." ...|$|E
