5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was normalised.

5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|Some {{theories}} {{attempt to}} explain Daily's tempestuous behaviour, {{one of which was}} put forth by Frank Vaccaro in his 1999 edition of The National Pastime. His theory explains that, in Daily's day, except in cases of injury, for a pitcher to be relieved from his position, another player already in the game would have to relieve him, and the pitcher would have to take a position in the field. His physical condition did not allow him many opportunities to play any other positions, so this compelled his managers to leave him in the game longer, even when his performance was declining. He was allowed to play in the field on several occasions, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> warranted it, as he is credited as playing three games in the outfield, two at second base, and one at shortstop.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{importance}} of situated cognition, {{it is not easy to}} figure out its structure. The major reason for this is the argument that cognition cannot be discernable from <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> where it operates. However, the traditional model(dimension-based model) is still needed for understanding the cognitive mechanism and for providing developmental diagnosis. We employed three-step approach for separating cognition and situation on a set of situational judgment data we collected from the domain of insurance sales. As a result of three-step approach we obtained three dimensions of practical knowledge: flexible thinking, pursuit of shor-term goals, and understanding the core problems. However, it should be emphasized, those dimensions are knowledge structure that are interpretable and useful in <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> that are critical for insurance sales domain. Also we developed a method of computing proportion of variance attributable to <b>situations</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>situation</b> is perceived as multiple dimensions instead of unidimension and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> are correlated...|$|R
5|$|The TSQ-81 antenna only {{received}} {{minor damage}} during the attack, and the U.S. suffered no casualties. However, the only 105mm howitzer {{operated by the}} Hmongs received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective. At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, {{on the basis that}} the situation had become critical. About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing up towards the U.S. facility at Lima Site 85. At 21:15 Sullivan considering evacuating all U.S. personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the Seventh Air Force contacted the U.S. Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on top of Phou Pha Thu was no longer under their control.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region {{who were involved in}} building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E
5|$|By staying and {{fighting}} the Viet Cong had surprised the Australians, who {{expected them to}} withdraw rapidly to their jungle bases following their attack on Lang Phuoc Hai as they had on previous occasions. This assumption had led the Australians to commit forces in a piecemeal fashion <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> required a deliberate battalion attack supported by blocking forces, a co-ordinated indirect fire plan, and APCs. Yet such an operation would have required considerable time to plan and execute, and Townsend had been ordered not to become too heavily engaged. Ad hoc and planned in haste, Operation Bribie went badly for the Australians from the start with delays in deploying the reaction force. Expecting only minor contact, Graham had finally sent the battalion out after midday and ordered it to return before nightfall. Yet this restriction {{had a significant impact}} on the operation, and limited the time available to commanders at all levels for planning and reconnaissance, thereby preventing a more deliberate approach. Once committed, the Australians realised that they had struck at least a company from D445 Battalion with elements of a heavy weapons company, possibly supported by North Vietnamese reinforcements and at least five machine-guns, one heavy machine-gun and two recoilless rifles. Graham had intended to land 6 RAR behind the Viet Cong in order to cut-off their withdrawal, yet instead they had almost landed directly on top of them. Further misjudgement and circumstance affected the Australian response once the battle began, with the initial reports that the Viet Cong position was a 'camp' proving incorrect, as had the belief that the dense scrub made the area unsuitable for cavalry. Meanwhile, A Company's initial assault had lacked adequate artillery support, while B Company's final assault had been hampered by the requirement for A Company's supporting fire to cut-off early. The resulting friction had then culminated in A Squadron's difficulty linking-up with B Company in the dense vegetation, further delaying their relief.|$|E
