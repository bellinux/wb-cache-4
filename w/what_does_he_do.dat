500|$|At one time, Brooklyn Dodgers fans hated O'Malley so {{much for}} moving their beloved team that he was {{routinely}} mentioned along with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as the most villainous 20th-century men; one version of a joke went, [...] "If a Brooklyn man finds himself {{in a room with}} Hitler, Stalin, and O'Malley, but has only two bullets, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Shoot O'Malley twice." [...] Some still consider him among the worst three men of the 20th century. Much of the animosity was not just for moving the team, but robbing Brooklyn of the sense of a cohesive cultural and social identity that a major sports franchise provides. Despite the long-standing animosity of Brooklyn fans and their supporters in baseball, O'Malley was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 after having been elected by the Veterans Committee with the minimal number of votes necessary for acceptance.|$|E

If he is a U.S. citizen you produce the papers. If he's not a U.S. citizen, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> He hides them. He's hiding them. We need the truth. We need the {{documents}} unsealed. We need to know what's going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Churchill's many fanciful {{strategic}} ideas {{collided with}} sound military strategy {{it was only}} Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{who was able to}} stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: [...] "When I thump the table and push my face towards him <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. I know these Brookes â€“ stiff-necked Ulstermen and there's no one worse to deal with than that!" [...] It has been claimed that part of Churchill's greatness was that he appointed Brooke as CIGS and kept him for the whole war.|$|E

6000|$|... --What is he? he asked. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Wasn't {{he in the}} {{stationery}} line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was always}} {{frightening}} me, always breaking out with fresh astonishers, {{in new and}} unexpected places. Toward evening on the second day, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe! ...|$|E
6000|$|These points {{then being}} {{arranged}} {{to the poor}} fellow's satisfaction, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but send out for half a quire of pink note-paper, and in a filagree envelope despatch a note of invitation to the ladies at the [...] "Bootjack":-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{came the}} Reformation. Down went {{the worship of}} the Mother. And there was man still saddled to his repose-destroyer. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> then?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He hears {{nothing more}} {{remarkable}} than {{that a person}} visiting him, who {{is interested in the}} case, refuses to accept the verdict at the Macallan Trial as a final verdict, and proposes to reopen the inquiry. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> upon that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am fearing, my angel, that I have {{offended}} you. You {{have too}} surely said to yourself, This miserable Harry {{might have made}} me happy by writing two lines--and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> He sends a message in words which tell me nothing.|$|E
6000|$|MYRRHINA. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do,</b> the {{beautiful}} young hermit? Does he sow or reap? Does he plant a garden or catch {{fish in a}} net? Does he weave linen on a loom? Does he set {{his hand to the}} wooden plough and walk behind the oxen? ...|$|E
6000|$|Bless me, Martin {{thought to}} himself, he doesn't know what I was talking about. He hasn't {{understood}} {{a word of}} it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with his education, anyway? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> How did the {{brainstorm}} burst? Did he jump at {{you from}} behind a door and bite a piece out of your leg, or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say he was a teapot?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh!' rejoined Ralph, 'I {{thought you}} did. Well! Handsome or not handsome, to {{this old man}} there comes a young fellow who casts all manner of fierce defiances in his teeth--gums I should rather say--and tells him in plain terms that his {{mistress}} hates him. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> that for?

6000|$|... "I {{guess they}} was {{powerful}} green {{to do anything}} o' the sort," [...] said Big Waller.

6000|$|... "He told me {{that you}} and he were in the field {{hospital}} together for a time, and before then he helped you in some way when you were wounded, but he never said much about it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> You may smoke while you tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said just}} what you said when you were {{speaking}} of Missouri a while ago, that {{he was afraid of}} guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly over. I signed 'em.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, despised," [...] nodded Killian, {{filling a}} long pipe, [...] "and, to {{my way of}} thinking, justly despised.

60|$|There was an {{engaging}} shyness in Bella, coupled with {{an engaging}} tenderness of love and confidence and pride, in thus first calling him by name, which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was, once more {{to give her the}} appearance of vanishing as aforesaid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the {{gun that}} your uncle {{used to keep}} in the garden, and that wasn't there. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with it?

6000|$|They {{descended the}} precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, {{and set off}} at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road.

6000|$|... "Do?" [...] Mr. Pike's {{voice was}} fraught with {{surprise}} that I should not know. [...] "Do? Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to old Captain Somers?

6000|$|... "A {{powerful}} {{argument in}} favour of kindness to animals!" [...] said Psmith.
