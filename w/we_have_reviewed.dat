[...] The First Circuit approved those instructions, with a rather substantial caveat:We conclude that though a few isolated sentences of the charge may have been unclear or overstated, the instructions {{taken as a whole}} were largely consistent with the position plaintiff argued before us. Therefore, we will not reverse {{on the basis of the}} court's instructions. This holding is a narrow one, and it may be useful to point out what we do not hold. We have no occasion to pass on portions of the court's instruction other than those discussed above. Even as to those portions we have considered, the issue we have decided, technically, is not whether those portions are correct as a matter of law, but whether they conform to the objecting party's view of the law. Finding they do, we see no remaining controversy. Because there are no sure yardsticks against which to measure the court's instructions, we cannot say that even those we considered are correct or the best possible, but we have not found any law conflicting with the portions of the charge <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>reviewed.</b>|$|E

This [...] "Explanations" [...] text includes the (c. 280) Lingbao wufu jing 靈寶五符經 [...] "Scripture of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans", which says:The Third Immortal King told the Emperor: In the old days I followed a dietetic regimen and attained immortality. My teacher made me increase the sweet spring in my mouth and swallow it {{in accordance with the}} following incantation: [...] "The white stones, hard and rocky, are rolling on and on. The gushing spring, bubbling and pervasive, becomes a thick juice. Drink it and attain long life - Longevity forever longer!" [...] These twenty-two words—you should follow them! If you can actually do this and nourish on the True One without stopping, swallow from your flowery pond without interruption, then your inner energy will grow and remain strong, never to be weakened. You attain the Tao by avoiding all grains. You will never again have to follow the rhythm of the moon and plant or harvest. Now, the people of mysterious antiquity, they reached old age because they remained in leisure and never ate any grains. As the Dayou zhang 大有章 (Verse of Great Existence) says: [...] "The five grains are chisels cutting life away, making the five organs stink and shorten our spans. Once entered into our stomach, there's no more chance to live quite long. To strive for complete avoidance of all death, keep your intestines free of excrement!" [...] (tr. Kohn 1993:149-150)Campany uses internalism and externalism to analyze how early texts justified the idea that shiqi 食氣 [...] "eating qi" [...] is better than shigu [...] "eating grains". For examples (2005:2), [...] "We eat X because X makes us live long" [...] is an internalist rationale based upon essential properties or benefits; [...] "We eat X and not Y, which is what those other people eat" [...] is an externalist claim based upon cultural stereotypes. After comprehensive analysis of how early texts describe [...] "grain" [...] (i.e., [...] "mainstream food") avoidance, from the (c. 320 BCE) Zhuangzi to the (c. 320 CE) Baopuzi, Campany (2005:43) concludes the (c. 280 CE) Lingbao wufu jing is the earliest passage [...] "in which grains are attacked as a food source based on what we might call negative internalist reasons—that is, {{on the grounds that they}} cause actual harm to the body in specific, theorized ways." [...] Before the 3rd century, Chinese classical texts did not claim that [...] "grains" [...] actually harm the body, they argued that [...] " [...] qi and other more refined substances, when ingested and circulated in esoterically prescribed ways, give superior and (for some texts at least) longevity-inducing nourishment."One of the striking things about the texts <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>reviewed</b> is that most of them offer very little by way of an internalist critique of grains or other everyday foods. That is, they all recommend avoiding grains and offer what they tout as superior alternatives, but on the question of precisely why grains are such inferior nourishment they have little or nothing to say. What little internalist critique we do find comes quite late — apparently Eastern Han at the earliest — and does not seem well developed: ordinary foods, described as rotten and smelly, impurify a body that must be brought into qi-based resonance with heaven. This impurity is located specifically in the intestines. … In most discussions, then, it is not that prescribers and practitioners of transcendence arts portrayed ordinary food as harmful; it is rather that they had what they considered superior alternatives to offer. But, why these diets of qi or of rare herbs and minerals should be regarded as superior to one of ordinary food is a question that very often remains unanswered; we are merely, but repeatedly and in diverse ways, told that they are superior. (2005:48)Echoing Claude Lévi-Strauss, Campany (2005:50) suggests that grains, inexorably linked with all their cultural and institutional symbolisms, were [...] "good to oppose" [...] rather than being seen as intrinsically [...] "bad to eat." [...] One of the major reasons for consuming wild plants and exotic foods was the inherent contrast with eating everyday [...] "grains".|$|E
