5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E

He <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

25|$|Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges {{very similar}} to a {{dramatic}} soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease {{in which the two}} voice-types sing – a mezzo <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and will go up to notes like high B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower tessitura.|$|E

25|$|A vector bundle (E, p, M) is smooth, if E and M are smooth manifolds, p : E → M is {{a smooth}} map, {{and the local}} trivializations are diffeomorphisms.

In this section we <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> on C∞-bundles. The most important example of a C∞-vector bundle is the tangent bundle (TM,πTM,M) of a C∞-manifold M.|$|E

25|$|Long draw is spun from a carded rolag. The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> in the thinnest part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.|$|E
25|$|The US force {{level will}} drop to between 10,000 and 20,000 troops {{according}} to the Long War Journal.

US/ISAF troops will continue their training of Afghan National Security Forces soldiers. Counterterrorism forces <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> mostly on high-value targets. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated on 12 November 2012 that the Obama Administration will cease combat operations by the end of 2014, but it is still refining its timeline for withdrawing the remaining 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

25|$|Further {{practical}} aspects {{concern the}} amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how much noise there is in the output. All of these are a function of the loop filter of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator {{is in the form of}} short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes frequency modulation of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with harmonics. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> on when building a synthesizer system.|$|E

One of the stores is located at Madison Square Garden, where Horton played {{as a member of}} the New York Rangers from 1969 to 1971. In 2009, Tim Hortons opened its first store in Albany, NY, with more stores on the way. Tim Hortons continued its southward expansion in the US by opening a restaurant at Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, in mid-December 2009. In November 2010, Tim Hortons announced it was closing 36 stores in the northeastern United States due to high competition with New England-based Dunkin' Donuts and Au Bon Pain. The stores, which made less than half the average company per-store sales, were concentrated heavily in the Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, areas, the former of which also has a concentration of stores from the locally-competing Honey Dew Donuts chain, itself with some 150 outlets in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. In the announcement, the chain stated that it <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> its efforts on its core markets such as western Canada. In the same statement, the company announced the sale of its portion of distribution company Maidstone Bakeries to Tim Hortons' European partners. It will use the C$400million generated by the sale for a stock buyback.|$|E

He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for this sequel {{at the bottom of the}} Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story.
