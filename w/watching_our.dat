500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> first version of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Johnston of Time Out New York wrote [...] "Let's face it: no film {{could ever}} match the {{expectations}} some have for Episode IThe Phantom Menace. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided you accept {{it on its}} own terms...Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, {{not the other way}} around." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said the film did [...] "plenty right" [...] and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto. David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said the film's better moments [...] "don't merely balance out the weaker onesthey topple them." [...] Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, [...] "there is still much pleasure to be had <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> full-blown Jedi guides in action." [...] He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance, and said the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi was [...] "the saga's very best lightsaber battle".|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that it was weird for her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple of those moments. It's cool." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway to take you where they want to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E
60|$|As we {{drew near}} to the cottage, I saw a lady {{standing}} by the gate, <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> approach. It was the Widow Canby.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Thus will I sit and sing, {{with love}} in my arms; <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> two herds mingle together, and below us the far, divine, cerulean sea.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Years later, Filipelli {{acknowledged}} that [...] "if {{you are a}} fan of Les Charlots, it's best that you don't <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> last films..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dash it! cousins can," [...] said Val. [...] "Next Long Vac.--it {{begins in}} June, you know, {{and goes on}} for ever--we'll <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll keep {{over this}} way a bit where there's {{no danger of}} his comin'. <b>Watch</b> <b>our</b> men try to get up that stairway! Ain't they the dandies!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Turkey feathers," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. [...] "But {{there are no}} wild turkeys down there, and I know it. Father was right, the Comanches are <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> home and {{surrounding}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be not so sure," [...] he answered, [...] "for I {{think that}} the Power follows us even down this dark gulf of death. I think also that I feel the sleepless eyes of Hes <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> secret souls." ...|$|E
6000|$|As we {{approached}} its mouth, where the Abati were crowded together, <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> conference, I heard them murmur, [...] "The Sultan, the Sultan himself!" [...] {{and saw the}} prince Joshua mutter some eager words to the officers about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cap'n Pennel, you're gettin' {{to make an}} idol of that 'ere child," [...] said Miss Ruey. [...] "We have to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> hearts. It minds me of the hymn,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] {{said the}} little man, winking slyly at Uncle Henry, [...] "you {{will do well}} to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> supper, my dear, and see that it doesn't boil over." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> companions. [...] "Indeed he is--extraordinarily amusing." [...] It {{was highly}} {{interesting}} to me to hear at last of Long's [...] "type of mind." [...] "See how amusing {{he is at the}} present moment to Mrs. Server." ...|$|E
60|$|Our canoe now passed quite near another batteau, {{the officer}} {{in command of}} which was {{standing}} erect, seemingly <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> movements. He appeared to be unhurt, but was probably intrusted with some special duty. As we paddled by, the following curious conversation occurred.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{accept your}} terms for the present," [...] Arthur answered, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "I had to see you. There are strangers {{continually}} <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> diggings, and making inquiries about Isobel. There are things happening which I cannot understand at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tonight, {{the moon}} that <b>watched</b> <b>our</b> lightsome wiles-- [...] That beamed upon {{us through the}} deodars-- Is wan with gazing on {{official}} files, [...] And desecrating desks disgust the stars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I move we {{make him}} stay around the camp," [...] {{suggested}} Tom. [...] "He can <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> stores, keep the fire furnished with wood, {{and do some}} of the cooking." ...|$|R
30|$|The most {{frequent}} notification {{was that the}} user was not wearing the <b>watch.</b> <b>Our</b> system {{was designed to be}} worn 24 h a day—otherwise it sends a reminder to the carer.|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} fond of my mother, though he lectured her soundly for her {{weakness}} in indulging me. I can see him as {{he sat at the}} head of the supper table, carving liberal helpings which Mary and Helen and Willie devoured with country appetites, <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> plates.|$|E
60|$|With {{a strong}} breeze, all sail set, {{and the ship}} {{in the hands of}} four or five men, {{exhausted}} by two nights' <b>watching,</b> <b>our</b> situation was bad enough; especially as the mate seemed more reckless than ever, and we were now to tack ship several times close under the land.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's more likely, sir, {{that some}} of the privateersmen have got ashore on planks and empty casks, and are prowling about in the weeds, <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> boats. Three or four of them would be too much for you, Captain Cuffe, as the scoundrels all carry knives as long as ship's cutlasses." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have said}} it was {{interesting}} to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> big hero, Number 666, in the performance of his arduous duties. He occupied the crossing on the city side of the circus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps we {{can play}} it very soon. We'll have to <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> chance," [...] was the answer. Slugger held out his box of {{cigarettes}} to Codfish. [...] "Here, Henry, have another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think, then, {{they see}} us, and <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> movements, Deerslayer? I was in hopes {{they might have}} fallen back into the woods, and left us to {{ourselves}} for a few hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} is most desirable," [...] Wulf agreed. [...] "The question is, {{who are we}} to send? It would be a terribly dangerous enterprise. Even now there are a score of men from the village <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> movements from the wood above. At any rate we must wait until nightfall." ...|$|E
60|$|So I called Marie, who was <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> talk {{somewhat}} anxiously {{while she}} went about her tasks. She came at once, {{a very different}} Marie to the starving girl of a while before, for although she was still thin and drawn, her youth and beauty were returning to her fast under the influences of good food and happiness.|$|E
60|$|We all {{bowed and}} said we should be delighted. Even Bastin {{appeared}} anxious to revisit Egypt in such company, though when he was there it seemed to bore him. But what she meant about taking us I could not guess. Nor had we time to ask her, for she went on, <b>watching</b> <b>our</b> faces as she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{can manage}} that, sooner or later. The main thing is, we must <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> chances and strike {{as soon as}} the right moment arrives. Now then, what do you say, Shepley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hilda <b>watched</b> <b>our</b> rescuers with parted {{lips and}} agonised eyes. Then she felt Sebastian's pulse. [...] "Thank Heaven," [...] she cried, [...] "he still lives! They {{will be here}} before he is quite past confession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is reason}} in this, Signore, wert thou beyond the wiles of this mysterious city. But in what manner thou embark, without drawing {{the notice of}} those who doubtless <b>watch</b> <b>our</b> movements, on thy person?" ...|$|R
