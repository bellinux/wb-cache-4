Comparison of a {{chemical}} composition of flour from wheaten germs with different nuts types shows that they don't concede on a nutrition value, and in the vitamins content of both some macro and microcells surpass nuts several times. Thus, considering preference of consumers of natural products and the maximum exception of compounding of synthetic taste-aroma maker, a problem of formation of nut aroma in the final product made with nuts replacement takes place. In our work we studied influences of heat treatment on aroma formation of <b>wheat</b> <b>germs</b> flour with application of piezo-sorption of "an electronic nose". Various content of easily volatile organic compounds in an equilibrium gas phase over tests depending on conditions of heat treatment is established: {{most of them in}} aroma of test 2, the smallest – in tests 1 and 4. On intensity of aroma or the contents of separate classes of easily volatile compounds the test differs from test standard. It is found out on responses of separate sensors that the equilibrium gas phase over samples contains hydrophilic connections and water, the content of nitrogen-containing and specific (aromatic) connections, esters is essential. On intensity of aroma or the maintenance of separate classes of easily volatile compounds the tests differ from test standard. Thus for the tests 3, 4, 5 the content of high-polarity volatile compounds increases (including ketones, alcohols), the content of esters, acids decreases. On a ratio of separate classes of connections in an equilibrium gas phase noticeable influence of time of heat treatment on redistribution of connections of RGF for flour of <b>germs</b> of <b>wheat</b> is determined.

In order to examine this, a short term human study was undertaken to evaluate the relative native folate bioavailabilities from spinach, Camembert cheese and <b>wheat</b> <b>germs</b> compared to pteroylmonoglutamic acid as the reference dose. The study had a single-centre, randomised, four-treatment, four-period, four-sequence, cross-over design, i. e. the four (food) items to be tested (referred to as treatments) were administered in sequences according to the Latin square, so that each experimental treatment occurred only once within each sequence and once within each study period. Each of the 24 subjects received the four experimental items separated by a 14 -day equilibrium phase and received a pteroylmonoglutamic acid supplement for 14 days before the first testing and between the testings for saturation of body pools. Folates in test foods, plasma and urine samples were determined by stable isotope dilution assays, and in urine and plasma, the concentrations of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate were evaluated. Standard non-compartmental methods were applied to determine the biokinetic parameters C, t and AUC from baseline corrected 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations within the interval from 0 to 12 hours. The variability of AUC and C was moderate for spinach and oral solution of pteroylmonoglutamic acid but high for Camembert cheese and very high for <b>wheat</b> <b>germs.</b> The median t was lowest for spinach, though t showed a high variability among all treatments. When comparing the ratio estimates of AUC and C for the different test foods, highest bioavailability was found for spinach followed by that for <b>wheat</b> <b>germs</b> and Camembert cheese. The results underline the dependence of folate bioavailability {{on the type of}} food ingested. Therefore, the general assumption of 50 % bioavailability as the rationale behind the definition of folate equivalents has to be questioned and requires further investigation. This journal i...|$|R

When there are abundant substrates available, fungus captures substrates quicker than mites due to their shorter life cycle and greater reproductive potential. [...] This leads to the slow development of mites and higher mortality. A. penicillioides can also alter the physical nature of substratum, which impedes mites' movement and increases food handling time. Female mites are more susceptible to these deleterious effects because they need to invest energy for egg production.|$|R

Although {{it was originally}} reported in patients with normolipemic xanthomas, severe hypercholesterolemia {{have been reported in}} patients with sitosterolemia, especially in children. Sitosterolemia is caused by increased intestinal absorption and decreased biliary excretion of sterols resulting from biallelic mutations in either ABCG 5 or ABCG 8, which encode the sterol efflux transporter ABCG 5 and ABCG 8. Patients with sitosterolemia show extreme phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from almost asymptomatic individuals to those with severe hypercholesterolemia leading to accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiac death. Hematologic manifestations include hemolytic anemia with stomatocytosis, macrothrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and abnormal bleeding. The mainstay of therapy includes dietary restriction of both cholesterol and plant sterols and the sterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe. Foods rich in plant sterols include vegetable oils, <b>wheat</b> <b>germs,</b> nuts, seeds, avocado, shortening, margarine and chocolate.
