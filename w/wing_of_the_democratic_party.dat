5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{successor}} in the Senate was William Cabell Rives, {{a conservative}} Democrat. In February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, {{which was to}} expire the following month. Rives had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found Rives a more politically expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split among three candidates, including Rives and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.|$|E

He also was state commander of the American Legion.|$|E
25|$|Jackson ran for {{president}} twice, and both campaigns were noted for the hostile reception they received from the left <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Jackson's one-on-one campaigning skills, which were so successful in Washington State, did not translate as well on the national stage. Even his supporters admitted that he suffered from a certain lack of charisma.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{raised his}} {{national}} profile by speaking out on Soviet-U.S. relations and Middle East policy regularly, {{and he was}} considered a front-runner for the nomination when he announced {{the start of his}} campaign in February 1975. Jackson received substantial financial support from Jewish-Americans who admired his pro-Israel views, but his support of the Vietnam War resulted in hostility from the left <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perez became wealthy by subleasing state mineral lands. In 1940, {{the state}} Crime Commission {{investigated}} Perez {{at the request}} of then Governor Sam Houston Jones. In 1943, Jones sent state troopers to Plaquemines Parish to enforce his appointment of an anti-Perez parish sheriff. Perez and Jones both came out of the conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> but whereas Perez had been a Huey Long backer, Jones was staunchly anti-Long.|$|E
25|$|Byrd was {{a member}} of the <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> that opposed {{desegregation}} and civil rights imposed by the federal government. However, despite his early career in the KKK, Byrd was linked to such senators as John C. Stennis, J.

25|$|Roosevelt named Wallace {{chairman}} of the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) and of the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board (SPAB) in 1941. Both positions became important with the U.S. entry into World War II. As he began to flex his newfound political muscle in his position with SPAB, Wallace came up against the conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{in the form of}} Jesse H. Jones, Secretary of Commerce, as the two differed on how to handle wartime supplies.|$|E
25|$|After Carlisle's term as Lieutenant Governor {{ended in}} 1875, {{he ran for}} and won {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives for Kentucky's 6th district. On the main issues of the day, Carlisle was in favor of coining silver, but not for free coinage, and favored lower tariffs. He became a leader of the low-tariff <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> and was chosen by House Democrats to become Speaker in 1883 over Samuel J. Randall, a leader of the party's {{protectionist}} wing.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{was inaugurated}} as the fifth Governor of Oklahoma on January 9, 1923. Walton {{represented}} the progressive <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and his policies reflected this. Despite this, {{many of the}} programs in his domestic policy (the Reconstruction League) were accepted by the Oklahoma Legislature and 1923 proved {{to be one of}} the most progressive legislative sessions in the state’s history. Among Walton’s reforms were an expanded farm cooperative program to aid troubled farms, a revision of the Workman's Compensation Law for improved benefits to employees, and stronger warehouse inspection laws to satisfy Oklahoma’s cotton and wheat farmers.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2003, as <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2004 presidential {{campaign}} {{was starting to}} pick up, the organization voiced concern that <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> contenders might be taking positions too far left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream general electorate. Early front-runner Howard Dean, who attracted popular support {{due in large part}} to his anti-war views despite his reputation as a centrist governor of Vermont, was specifically criticized by DLC founder and CEO Al From. From's criticism of Dean was also likely due to the former governor's opposition to the Iraq War, which most party centrists, including From, endorsed. Dean's claim to hail [...] "from <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party" [...] (a phrase originally used by Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota) has been interpreted by some as subtle(?) criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DLC and the New Democrats in general. Indeed, Dean once described the DLC as <b>the</b> [...] "Republican <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party." [...] <b>The</b> DLC countered that Dean represented the [...] "McGovern-Mondale wing" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, [...] "defined principally by weakness abroad and elitist, interest-group liberalism at home." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Wellstone {{formed an}} {{exploratory}} committee and a leadership PAC, the Progressive Politics Network, that {{paid for his}} travels to Iowa and New Hampshire, two early primary states in the nomination process. He spoke before organized labor and local Democrats, using the slogan, [...] "I represent <b>the</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party". Governor Howard Dean later incorporated that phrase into his stump speech in the 2004 US presidential election.|$|R

25|$|Historically, the Republican Party has {{included}} a liberal wing {{made up of}} individuals who, like members of the liberal <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> believe {{in the power of}} government to improve people's lives. Before 1932 leading progressive Republicans included Theodore Roosevelt, Robert M. La Follette Sr., Charles Evan Hughes, Hiram Johnson, William Borah, George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Fiorello La Guardia. Prominent liberal Republicans, 1936 to the 1970s, included Alf Landon, Wendell Willkie, Earl Warren, Thomas Dewey, Prescott Bush, Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., George W. Romney, William Scranton, Charles Mathias, Lowell Weicker, and Jacob Javits. Since 1976, liberalism has virtually faded out of the Republican Party, apart from a few Northeastern holdouts.|$|E
25|$|Before the Roe v. Wade {{decision}} making abortion legal in the United States, the pro-life {{movement in the}} United States consisted of elite lawyers, politicians, and doctors, almost {{all of whom were}} Catholic. The only coordinated opposition to abortion during the early 1970s came from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Family Life Bureau, also a Catholic organization. Mobilization of a wide-scale pro-life movement among Catholics began quickly after the Roe v. Wade decision with the creation of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). The NRLC also organized non-Catholics, eventually becoming the largest pro-life organization in the United States. The pro-life <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> was also led by Catholic Robert P. Casey, Sr. other pro-life Democrats including, Sargent Shriver, Raymond Flynn and Bob Casey, Jr.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal {{government}} to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E

Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the Free Soil Party, which {{was concerned about the}} threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly-colonised western territories. Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison derided the party philosophy as [...] "white manism." ...|$|E
500|$|Cleveland was a {{formidable}} policymaker, {{and he also}} drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide {{in addition to the}} party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver alienated the agrarian <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, [...] "n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not." [...] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, generally ranked among the second tier of American presidents.|$|E
500|$|When Stanley sought {{re-election}} to {{his seat}} in 1924, he faced an uphill battle. No Kentucky senator had been re-elected {{to his seat}} in over forty years (though senators had been popularly elected only since 1914). His opposition to prohibition cost him the support of pro-temperance voters and Democratic governor William J. Fields. He was also opposed by the Ku Klux Klan, then a powerful organization in the state, because of his opposition to bigotry and secret organizations. His Republican opponent Frederic M. Sackett secured {{the support of the}} Beckham <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> Despite having his own private stock of liquor, Sackett took a pro-temperance position in the campaign and was endorsed by the Anti-Saloon League. Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham added his endorsement, calling Sackett [...] "one of the best men I know". In the general election, Stanley lost his seat by almost 25,000 votes. Sackett's victory meant Kentucky would have two Republican senators {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|E
