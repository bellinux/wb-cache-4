In a relatively small ship he was required to stand sea watches, but also had direct responsibility for all details of ensuring royal life ran smoothly. The ship returned to England on 3 June.

In an interview in 2014, Heinz Prüller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: [...] "In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own funeral." [...] At another occasion, he said about the track: [...] "It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money." ...|$|E
