On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E

You know, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E

It peaked at No. 9 on the Canadian Albums chart. Allmusic's review gives the album three stars, commenting, [...] "Evancho's vocals are {{impressive}} as always, and the arrangements are mostly tasteful, with only occasional moments of bombast". The Salt Lake City Tribune rated the album [...] "A-", writing: [...] "some {{of us are}} still taken aback <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> such a strong, womanly voice float out of an 11 year-old child. ... Her best offering is the cherubic 'Believe'."

2500|$|In his {{introductory}} {{essay in}} the booklet accompanying the Opera Rara recording, Jeremy Commons takes many of the above comments one step further by drawing attention {{to the way in}} which the composer takes the melody of Elena's opening cavatina (Oh mattutini albori! / [...] "Oh rays of morning"), brings it back and into the duet with Uberto (Elena: Scendi nel piccolo legno / [...] "Step down into my little craft"), echoes it in the orchestra when the couple arrive at the island, and then re-introduces it right at the end of act 2 <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> Uberto singing it off-stage in the form of a canzoncina: Aurora! ah sorgerai ( [...] "Dawn! Ah! Will you always / Arise inauspiciously for me?"). Commons explains that this linking [...] "is evidence that Rossini was taking the first step towards a concept of an opera, not as a series of disparate items, but as an organized whole in which the parts refer back and forth to each other, adding extra resonances each time that material returns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ian Hislop, {{editor of}} the British satirical {{magazine}} Private Eye, stated, [...] "I am appalled and shocked by this horrific attack– a murderous attack on free speech {{in the heart of}} Europe.... Very little seems funny today." [...] The editor of Titanic, a German satirical magazine, declared, [...] "e are scared <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> about such violence. However, as a satirist, we are beholden to the principle that every human being has the right to be parodied. This should not stop just because of some idiots who go around shooting". Many cartoonists from around the world responded to the attack on Charlie Hebdo by posting cartoons relating to the shooting. Among them was Albert Uderzo, who came out of retirement at age 87 to depict his character Astérix supporting Charlie Hebdo. In Australia, what was considered the iconic national cartoonist's reaction was a cartoon by David Pope in the Canberra Times, depicting a masked, black-clad figure with a smoking rifle standing poised over a slumped figure of a cartoonist in a pool of blood, with a speech balloon showing the gunman saying, [...] "He drew first." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film had {{its opening}} premiere on March 2, 1965 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's [...] "romantic {{nonsense}} and sentiment", the children's [...] "artificial roles", and Robert Wise's [...] "cosy-cum-corny" [...] direction. Judith Crist, in a biting {{review in the}} New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as [...] "icky sticky" [...] and designed for [...] "the five to seven set and their mommies". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film [...] "the sugar-coated lie people {{seem to want to}} eat", and that audiences have [...] "turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs". [...] Wise later recalled, [...] "The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews." [...] Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "three hours of visual and vocal brilliance", and Daily Variety called it [...] "a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast". The [...] "wildly mixed film reviews" [...] reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country, and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.|$|E
5000|$|A sizable {{and highly}} imaginative march, notable for its element of chaos and its {{extremes}} of orchestration. Berg {{is said to}} have declared: [...] "There had to come a day <b>when</b> <b>we</b> could <b>hear</b> how a chord of eight tones really sounds in the brasses!".|$|R

50|$|Many {{characters}} speak simultaneously, and we {{are aware}} of the discreteness of their conversations, but as their comments bleed into those of others, the effect is to undermine the dialogue.

5000|$|Fusiform cells (also {{known as}} {{pyramidal}} cells).

60|$|As {{the truest}} society {{approaches}} always nearer to solitude, so the most excellent speech finally falls into Silence. Silence is audible to all men, at all times, {{and in all}} places. She is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> inwardly, sound <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> outwardly. Creation has not displaced her, but is her visible framework and foil. All sounds are her servants, and purveyors, proclaiming not only that their mistress is, but is a rare mistress, and earnestly to be sought after. They are so far akin to Silence, that they are but bubbles on her surface, which straightway burst, an evidence of the strength and prolificness of the under-current; a faint utterance of Silence, and then only agreeable to our auditory nerves when they contrast themselves with and relieve the former. In proportion as they do this, and are heighteners and intensifiers of the Silence, they are harmony and purest melody.|$|E
