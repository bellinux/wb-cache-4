5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} celebrity of sorts at Michigan. He was {{mentioned}} in several issues of Time magazine, and his wedding was even {{announced in the}} magazine. In addition, his time at Michigan defined an era {{in a way that}} became a permanent reference because his contemporaries <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that they were at Michigan in the Chappuis years. In 1988, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E
5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that.

When asked, he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he was keeping it for a great victory.|$|E
5|$|The patrons {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally {{applicable}} to horse racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports <b>would</b> <b>say</b> who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English <b>would</b> <b>say</b> instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she <b>would</b> <b>say</b> yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E
