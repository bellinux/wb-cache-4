5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of {{one standard deviation}} (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of}} the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo.

5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means.

Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> of functions both within and between species.
