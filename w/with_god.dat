5|$|As the Word, Jesus was {{eternally}} present <b>with</b> <b>God,</b> {{active in}} all creation, {{and the source}} of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.|$|E

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united <b>with</b> <b>God.</b> This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Moses {{begins with}} Moses' asking God about {{the purpose of}} creation. Moses is told in this account that God made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life. The book also {{provides}} an enlarged account of the Genesis creation narrative and expands the story of Enoch, the ancestor of Noah. In the narrative, Enoch speaks <b>with</b> <b>God,</b> receives a prophetic calling, and eventually builds a city of Zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven. The book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing the coming of Christ, in effect Christianizing the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity <b>with</b> <b>God.</b> This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's relationship <b>with</b> <b>God.</b> Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly unchaste or sexually abused individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation <b>with</b> <b>God)</b> is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E

5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated <b>with</b> <b>God</b> identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible.

5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites <b>with</b> <b>God,</b> so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede <b>with</b> <b>God</b> so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love <b>with</b> <b>God</b> Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E

In Digital Devil Saga 2, two new main characters are introduced Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society.

5|$|In Hymns of Divine Love (also called Hymns of Divine Eros) most {{of which}} were {{completed}} during his time in exile, Symeon describes his vision of God as uncreated divine light. That experience of divine luminosity is associated by Symeon with the Holy Trinity, <b>with</b> <b>God,</b> and sometimes with Christ. The Hymns are similar in theme to the Discourses, but are written with poetic meter and rhyme. He began writing them {{at the same time as}} the Discourses but only finished editing them during the last thirteen years of his life at the monastery of St. Macrina. There are 58 hymns totaling approximately 11,000 verses.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>god</b> Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) {{and those of}} Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E
