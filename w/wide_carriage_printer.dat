Programming {{languages}} used : Visual C++ 6. 0 and Microsoft Foundations Classes. Drilling Parameters Monitoring and Database Recording In the oil industry real-time well drilling monitoring is an important issue. The importance of this came from the amount of investment required {{and the level of}} uncertainties present in the well project. Thus, being able to reduce the risks in the drilling process is fundamental to the oil industry. Real-Time drilling monitoring can improve decision-making based in the geological model, avoiding possible problems and increasing efficiency. The drilling monitoring system consists of: 1. Sensors power supplies and interfaces panel, including intrinsically safe barriers. 2. Atlas G. I. P. uses 4 - 20 mA current loop sensors for analog signals, that provide noise immunity (it is virtually impossible to have electrical noise from a sensor) and digital sensors: 	Optical shaft encoder 	Pressure sensors 	Proximity sensors 	Ultrasonic system for mud pit levels 	Amp clamp type sensor 	Temperature sensors 3. 12 bit data acquisition board 4.

Similar principles were applied to the electric train sets, where quick passenger egress promoted a punctual service.|$|R

500|$|The {{station was}} built by Messrs Baker & Son of Canon's Marsh, Bristol. The buildings, {{constructed}} in a Gothic Revival style, cost £20,000, with the main buildings on the northern platform. There was a large booking hall with sizeable fireplaces at each end. Pointed ground floor doorways gave access to the hall, which was adjacent to the booking offices and waiting rooms. It is believed that the station master's lodgings in this building were never used as such. A <b>wide</b> <b>carriage</b> drive led down to the northern platform, which {{was linked to the}} southern platform by a glass-covered footbridge. There was originally no waiting room on the southern platform, but one was built in October 1898. The platforms were mostly covered by [...] "ridge and furrow" [...] glass roofs, supported by iron columns. The station was flooded in August 1883, which resulted in the installation of extra drainage. There was a large goods yard to the south of the platforms, accessed from the west, with a 28-lever signal box at the west end of the southern platform.|$|R

40|$|The first {{hospital}} {{outbreak of}} vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carriage rates of VRE and ampicillin-resistant enterococci (ARE) in Sweden were investigated. Clonal relationships and mutations in fluoroquinolone resistance determining regions among ARE collected nation-wide were studied. Risk factors for ARE infection, shedding of ARE {{and the presence}} of the virulence gene esp in ARE isolates and patients on a hematology unit and other units at Uppsala University Hospital were further investigated. The first Swedish hospital VRE outbreak was due to clonal spread of E. faecium, vanA. The nation <b>wide</b> <b>carriage</b> rates of ARE and VRE were 21. 5 % / 1 % and 6 % / 0 %, among hospitalized patients and non-hospitalized individuals respectively. All ARE and VRE were E. faecium and > 90 % resistant to ciprofloxacin. All VRE carried vanB. Carriage of ARE was independently associated with > 5 days of antibiotic treatment. Phenotypic and genetic typing showed a significantly higher homogeneity among ARE compared to matched ASE E. faecium isolates. Mutations conferring high-level ciprofloxacin resistance were found only in ARE. Risk factors for ARE infection included long duration of hospital stay and exposure to antibiotics. Skin carriage was associated with ARE shedding. ARE bacteremia was independently associated with prior ARE colonization and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Death was more common in ARE septicemia cases compared to controls. Esp was significantly more common in ARE surveillance compared to ARE blood isolates from patients on the hematology ward. In conclusion, VRE were rare but clonally related multi-resistant ARE E. faecium were highly prevalent in Swedish hospitals. Spread of ARE in hospitals during the 1990 s is suggested to be the main explanation for the emergence of ARE in Sweden. Spread was facilitated by use of antibiotics and probably by the presence of virulence genes in E. faecium isolates...|$|R
