5|$|Kentikian {{retained}} her WIBF and WBA belts with {{a unanimous}} decision win over Elena Reid from the United States on March 20, 2009. Reid, who {{was well known}} in Germany after two controversial bouts with Halmich in 2004 and 2005, remained largely passive from the opening bell and Kentikian controlled her through {{the majority of the}} fight. Reid did not win a single round on the official scorecards. On July 4, 2009, Kentikian fought the Interim WBA Super Flyweight Champion Carolina Gutierrez Gaite of Argentina. Kentikian used her speed and combinations to dominate her opponent through the ten rounds, winning every round on the judges' scores. Kentikian ended 2009 by fighting the undefeated Turkish-German Julia Sahin (20–0) on 10 October for the vacant WBO Female Flyweight title. Kentikian overwhelmed Sahin with her higher <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> early on. Sahin spent most of the fight covering up from Kentikian's many flurries. Kentikian gave Sahin a ten-round beating and won a unanimous decision to become the new WBO Female Flyweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his <b>work</b> <b>rate,</b> longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether changes in {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) following intensive cycling training contribute to the mechanism of training-induced bradycardia. Thirteen healthy untrained subjects, ages 18 - 27 years, underwent recordings of heart rate (HR) and VO 2 max before and after 8 weeks of cycling, 25 - 60 min/day, 5 days/week at > 80 % maximum HR (HRmax). Heart rate recordings were obtained during supine rest and submaximal exercise and were analysed for the following components of HRV: low frequency (LF, 0. 041 - 0. 15 Hz); high frequency (HF, 0. 15 - 0. 40 Hz); LF/HF ratio and total power (TP, 0 - 0. 40 Hz). At posttraining, VO 2 max was significantly increased while HR was significantly reduced at rest and all absolute exercise <b>work</b> <b>rates.</b> Training-induced lower HR was accompanied by significantly greater HF and TP during rest as well as LF, HF, and TP during all absolute exercise <b>work</b> <b>rates.</b> Posttraining HR {{and the majority of}} HRV measures were similar to pretraining values at the same relative exercise intensity (% HRmax). These results indicated that 8 weeks of intensive cycling training increased HRV and cardiac vagal modulation during rest and absolute exercise <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> but had little effect during relative exercise <b>work</b> <b>rates.</b> Increased vagal modulation resulting from intensive exercise training may contribute to the mechanism of training-induced bradycardia...|$|R

40|$|The present paper aims {{to study}} the {{regional}} pattern of work participation of scheduled caste population in secondary sector of economy in Uttar Pradesh and how their secondary <b>work</b> participation <b>rates</b> (Total, Rural and Urban) are related with various socio-economic indicators. The entire study {{is based upon the}} district level secondary data obtained from Census of India, 2001 and the State Planning Institute, Lucknow, 2001. Carl Pearson co-efficient of correlation and student t test techniques are used to find out the relationship between secondary <b>work</b> participation <b>rate</b> of scheduled caste population (Total, Rural and Urban) and various other socio-economic indicators. From the results it is clear that secondary <b>work</b> participation <b>rates</b> of scheduled caste population is high in the central and southern part of the state, whereas, western districts are showing low level of secondary <b>work</b> participation <b>rates</b> of scheduled caste population. It is also clear from the results of co-efficient of correlation that scheduled caste sex ratio have indirect bearing on secondary <b>work</b> participation <b>rates</b> of total scheduled caste population.

25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, <b>work</b> <b>rate,</b> tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel.

Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The exercise-induced rise in {{arterial}} potassium concentration ([K+]a) {{may contribute}} to exercise hyperpnea and could {{play a role in}} exertional fatigue. This study was designed to determine whether the exercise-induced rise in [K+]a is altered in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and whether physical training affects K+ homeostasis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 10 subjects with CHF (ejection fraction, 23 +/- 3. 9 %) and 10 subjects with normal left ventricular function (NLVF) who had undergone previous coronary artery graft surgery (ejection fraction, 63 +/- 8. 6 %). Subjects performed an incremental cycle ergometer exercise test before and after a physical training or detraining program. Changes in [K+]a and ventilation (VE) during exercise were closely related in both groups. Subjects with CHF did less absolute work and had reduced maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) compared with subjects with NLVF (P <. 01). Exercise-induced rises in [K+]a, VE, norepinephrine, lactate, and heart rate were greater at matched absolute <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> in subjects with CHF than in subjects with NLVF (P <. 01). However, when the rise in [K+]a was plotted against percentage of VO 2 max to match for relative submaximal effort, there were no differences between the two groups. Physical training resulted in reduced exercise-induced hyperkalemia at matched submaximal <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> in both groups (P <. 01) despite no associated change in the concentration of arterial catecholamines. At maximal exercise when trained, peak increases in [K+]a were unaltered, but peak concentrations of catecholamines were raised (P <. 05). The decrease in VE at submaximal <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> after training was not significant with this incremental exercise protocol, but both groups had an increased peak VE when trained (P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-induced rises in [K+]a, catecholamines, and VE are greater at submaximal <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> in subjects with CHF than in subjects with NLVF. Physical training reduces the exercise-induced rise in [K+]a but does not significantly decrease VE during submaximal exercise with this incremental cycle ergometry protocol. The reduction in exercise-induced hyperkalemia after training is not the result of altered concentrations of arterial catecholamines. The pathophysiological significance of the increased exercise-induced hyperkalemia in CHF and the mechanisms of improved K+ homeostasis with training have yet to be established...|$|R
