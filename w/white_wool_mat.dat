40|$|Abstract. Glass <b>wool</b> <b>mat</b> {{is widely}} used {{in the fields of}} {{building}} engineering, transport facilities and refrigeration equipment. In this paper, the effect of material parameters such as density, thickness, porosity, and flow resistivity on the normal incidence absorption coefficient has been studied. In addition, fiber length is also investigated to achieve appropriate strength. The prediction error of normal incidence absorption coefficient by modified Johnson–Allard model is less than 5 % in the frequency range between 800 Hz and 5 kHz. We could use the modified Johnson–Allard model to determine the parameter of glass <b>wool</b> <b>mat</b> for better development...|$|R

50|$|There {{were four}} {{different}} floor plans: 8 x 8 m, 8 x 10 m, 8 x 13 m, and 8 x 16 m. The individual modules {{of the steel}} houses were assembled on site. The rectangular outer wall panels were made of 1 mm thick steel plate with a size of 1 x 2.51 m and were placed next to each other. The interior walls were made of hardboard or plywood panels, which were insulated by glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> from the outer steel sheets. The roof structure was formed from standardized trusses 8 m in length. The floor was well insulated with glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> and consisted of tongue and groove planks that were mounted on the modular steel frame construction.|$|R

40|$|Traditional practises {{employed}} in designing and installing peripheral drainage systems around subgrade construction {{have not been}} entirely successful, particularly where the basement space is to be finished. A new method is introduced where drainage along the basement wall {{takes place in a}} 10 mm mineral wool layer having a density of 50 kg/m[3]. In the experiment two such layers were placed against the foundation wall. This new method is a modification of the standard method of replacing free draining backfill. It would have the two fold purpose of providing a free draining layer so that water could readily reach the footing drains and also supply a heat insulating layer {{on the outside of the}} foundation. Laboratory tests simulating field conditions indicate that glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> make a suitable draining and capillary disrupting layer against a basement wall, provided that, as always, satisfactory draining around the foot of the foundation was provided. Laid in two layers and without continuous joints, the glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> used in the Norwegian Building Research Institute test setups showed better properties than the more conventional techniques they were compared with. No water penetration was recorded and the mats showed no sign of plugging. The Norwegian Building Research Institute hopes to be able to test several other ways of draining basement walls so that different solutions for different applications can be recommended.

50|$|Natural {{sand and}} {{recycled}} glass are mixed and heated to 1,450 °C, to produce glass. The fiberglass is usually {{produced by a}} method similar to making cotton candy, by forcing it through a fine mesh by centripetal force, cooling on contact with the air. Cohesion and mechanical strength are obtained {{by the presence of}} a binder that “cements” the fibers together. A drop of bonder is placed at each fiber intersection. The fiber mat is then heated to around 200 °C to polymerize the resin and is calendered to give it strength and stability. Finally, the <b>wool</b> <b>mat</b> is cut and packed in rolls or panels, palletized, and stored for use.|$|R
