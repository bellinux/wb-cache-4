5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E

I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression.

My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1970s, ABC—which {{had become}} the top-rated {{television}} network in the United States—began looking for stronger affiliates across the country. KMSP-TV (channel 9), the Twin Cities' ABC affiliate since 1961, had long struggled in the ratings. ABC had approached independent station WTCN-TV (channel 11, now KARE), CBS affiliate WCCO-TV (channel 4), and KSTP-TV to affiliate with the network. Channel 5 surprised the industry in August 1978 by announcing its intention to sever ties with third-place NBC after 30 years to join ABC. The affiliation switch occurred on March 5, 1979 and was ABC's biggest coup at the time. “We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the 1980s in a leadership position with a network which we think has the management, team and depth to be the best. That's ABC. We're just absolutely thrilled,” said KSTP's Stanley S. Hubbard, son of station founder Stanley E. Hubbard. In 2000, Hubbard Broadcasting purchased independent station KVBM-TV (channel 45; now KSTC), creating Minnesota's first commercial television station duopoly (though there is a longstanding public television duopoly: KTCA/KTCI).|$|E

500|$|As {{the first}} female {{presenter}} of Grandstand, Helen Rollason was a pioneer of British sports broadcasting, an industry that was predominantly male at the time, and she established a precedent that allowed others to follow. Sue Barker, Hazel Irvine, Gail McKenna, Shelley Webb and Gabby Yorath all followed in Rollason's footsteps to become noted UK sports presenters, with Yorath joining ITV as their first female sports presenter in the late 1990s, where she co-hosted the football show On the Ball and was a contributor to The Premiership. Yorath paid tribute to Rollason shortly after her death, saying she would be [...] "an icon for young girls who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> that field because she showed what could be done. She was a great example to everyone." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E

[...] Jones accepted the role to get something different from her job in the TV series Mad Men. While discovering that like the show First Class was set in the 1960s, the actress considered that: [...] "'s so, so far from Betty and from Mad Men, and it takes place in that time but it doesn’t feel like a period movie." [...] The actress described the revealing costumes of the character as [...] "insane," [...] saying, [...] "She's got quite the bod, which is very intimidating".

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Out Magazine, Amos used the song [...] "Maybe California", a track from the album in which a mother ruminates on leaving her husband and child(ren) [...] "better off" [...] as she contemplates suicide, to explain just how personal writing and composing both the song and the record as a whole were for her: [...] "I wouldn’t have written this record if I hadn’t been pushed — {{for all kinds of}} reasons. I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> all of it but “Maybe California” doesn’t come from nowhere. You’re not able to write that by having a drink with somebody who’s had the experience and you haven’t. You have to be pushed to that place." [...] She speaks of the mother figure in the song: [...] "there's nothing that she can give to stop this terrible emotional cancer that has taken over her family - her life - everything around her." [...] Adding credence to the notion that the song is deeply autobiographical, Amos chose to highlight the despair older, more mature women, such as herself, face: [...] "I began to realize how serious this quiet, tragic problem was and that it's not okay to talk about it, whereas teen suicide - it gets discussed and it's almost something where there are [...] for it. But mothers contemplating this - my God - they're just going to put you in a nuthouse." ...|$|E
