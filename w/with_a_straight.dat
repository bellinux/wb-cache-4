5|$|Barnes lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours. After registering his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. Barnes stepped out to attack Laker but missed; luckily for him, Evans failed to collect the ball as it turned down the leg side.|$|E
5|$|Silva re-opened {{the action}} {{standing}} {{with a combination}} of punches and kicks. Jackson answered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> right hand, knocking Silva on to the canvas. Jackson followed Silva down and looked to finish the fight in Silva's closed guard. Jackson moved into side control shortly after and landed a clean knee strike to Silva's head followed by several punches, again to the head to end the round.|$|E

5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks {{are long and}} broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{retained}} the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made {{a world record}} Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When he was on 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls {{in an attempt to}} break Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit out, but the Englishman blocked them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> bat.|$|E
5|$|Bond rapidly rebuilds his {{position}} {{before the next}} break. Le Chiffre's girlfriend, Valenka, spikes Bond's martini with poison. Bond vomits and retreats to his Aston Martin to inject himself with an antidote. MI6 instructs him to use the defibrillator, but a wire is disconnected; Vesper saves Bond by reconnecting the wire. Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond wins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> flush.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} fight as undisputed welterweight champion, he fought Cosme Rivera on May 14, 2005, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Judah sent Rivera down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> {{left hand to}} the face less than 30seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard {{several times in the}} second round, and in the third round, he {{connected}} with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to stagger backwards and fall into the ropes before hitting the canvas. Rivera rose at the count of five, but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
5|$|In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie {{arrives and}} orders them to {{retrieve}} the diamonds and ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off his ear <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> razor. He is about to set Nash on fire, but is shot dead by Orange. Orange explains to Nash {{that he is an}} undercover police officer and that the police will arrive soon.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{played a}} steady grass season, with a win–loss of 6–3, the second-best result judged by wins {{in her career}} on grass. She reached {{the second round of}} Wimbledon {{for the first time since}} 2011. Kuznetsova withdrew from most of the North America tournaments, {{including}} the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati, due to a left leg injury. At the US Open, she lost in the first round to Kristina Mladenovic. Kuznetsova renewed herself in Guangzhou, reaching the quarterfinals. She eventually received her first trophy this season at the Kremlin Cup <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets victory over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the final, becoming the 15th title in her career.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-year}} {{absence from the}} Copa Libertadores, Atlético {{qualified}} for the 1981 edition as runner-up of the 1980 Campeonato Brasileiro, which it had lost to Flamengo. The refereeing in the finals had been controversial, as Atlético forward Reinaldo was sent off <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> red card after scoring a brace. Brazil's representatives were once again drawn into Group 3, together with Olimpia and Cerro Porteño, whom Atlético faced {{for a second time}} in a group stage of the Libertadores. The two encounters between the Brazilian clubs ended 22, and both won two and drew two matches against the Paraguayans, meaning Atlético and Flamengo were tied on points. According to the competition's rules, a one-game playoff in a neutral stadium had to be played between the clubs to decide which one would advance to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|After strong grass court {{seasons in}} 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who were seeded {{first and second}} respectively. He began his title defence with {{straight}} sets wins over David Goffin and Blaž Rola, defeating the latter {{for the loss of}} just two games. Murray continued his good form, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut and Kevin Anderson, the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinal. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semifinals {{for the first time since}} 2008. After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to 10th in the world, his lowest ranking since 2008.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae.

5|$|At the US Open, Murray {{entered a}} Grand Slam tournament as {{defending}} champion {{for the first}} time, and started strongly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets win against Michaël Llodra. He backed this up with wins over Leonardo Mayer, Florian Mayer and Denis Istomin to reach the quarterfinals at a major for the 11th straight tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in straight sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals. Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the Great Britain Davis Cup team in their World Group Play-off tie on clay against Croatia, where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16-year-old Borna Ćorić in straight sets, Murray teamed up with Colin Fleming to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavić in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the World Group by defeating Dodig in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Barnes lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching triple figures. Having registered his century and fulfilled his bet, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He stepped out of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side. Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the long on boundary and two fours. Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by Cyril Washbrook from the bowling of Yardley. He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> bat and {{stretching}} forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past mid on for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.|$|E

5|$|Federer's season {{turned around}} in the final masters event of the clay season when he {{defeated}} Nadal on clay {{for only the second}} time to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals. In the final, he faced Söderling, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.|$|E
5|$|He {{played his}} first tournament since {{undergoing}} wrist {{surgery in the}} 2016 Delray Beach Open. In his first competitive match in almost a year, del Potro defeated Denis Kudla in two sets. He followed this up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets win over Australian John-Patrick Smith. He defeated Jérémy Chardy in two sets in the quarterfinal, reaching his first semifinal since 2014; which he lost to eventual champion Sam Querrey. He returned to Indian Wells, competing in the first round, winning against Tim Smyczek in two sets. He lost in the next round to Tomas Berdych in straight sets. His next tournament was the Miami Open. He won his first match against countryman Guido Pella in two sets. He was set to play Roger Federer {{for the first time}} in more than two years, but just hours before the match Federer withdrew due to a stomach virus. He then played lucky loser and countryman Horacio Zeballos and lost in straight sets. He then competed in his first clay-court tournament since 2013 at the BMW Open. He won his first clay-court match in three years against Dustin Brown, beating him in two sets.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian Open well <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
