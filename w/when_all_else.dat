25|$|According to Eliade, heavenly Supreme Beings are {{actually}} less common in more advanced cultures. Eliade speculates that {{the discovery of}} agriculture brought a host of fertility gods and goddesses into the forefront, causing the celestial Supreme Being to fade away and eventually vanish from many ancient religions. Even in primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the High God is a vague, distant figure, dwelling high above the world. Often he has no cult and receives prayer {{only as a last}} resort, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> has failed. Eliade calls the distant High God a deus otiosus ("idle god").|$|E

Eventually, Eric protectively confronts and kills a stalker after Amy and Lauren. He is tried and found not guilty, but does so by lying on the witness stand. Maxine is disappointed in him, so he decides to move to Canada with his boyfriend, Mark.|$|E
2500|$|Apu, as the lying {{statue of}} Jesus is fondly called by devotees, {{has become a}} symbol of hope for people longing for a {{connection}} to the divine especially <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> failed. His image is supine, bruised, caught in the final act of love and sacrifice that has spelled salvation for those who believe in Him. [...] Every kiss that lands His badly bruised feet or a touch that grazes His battered hand comes with a deep conviction that through His death and resurrection, He made all things new. [...] Apung Mamacalulu bestows mercy beyond the grave.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{sculpture}} on the High Road of a man sitting next to a bee hive. Again, this is another reference to the [...] "Bee". The sculpture is popularly known as the [...] "Bee-man", [...] "the man of Beeston", [...] "The Beekeeper" [...] or [...] "Bee King", though its actual title is 'The Beeston Seat'. This was designed and sculpted by renowned artist Sioban Coppinger in 1987, modelled on her friend Stephen Hodges as he 'has that timeless ability to exude calm <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> are succumbing to stress'. The piece is a popular photo opportunity to visitors to Beeston, frequently being dressed in hats and scarves in cold weather, and sun hats and sunglasses in summer.|$|E
2500|$|Masami Eiri is {{introduced}} {{as the project}} director on Protocol Seven (the next-generation Internet protocol in the series' time-frame) for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories. He had secretly included code of his very own creation to give himself absolute control of the Wired through the wireless system described above. He then [...] "uploaded" [...] his own brain, conscience, consciousness, memory, feelings, emotions – his very self – into the Wired and [...] "died" [...] a few days after, leaving only his physical, living body behind. These details are unveiled around {{the middle of the}} series, but this is the point where the story of Serial Experiments Lain begins. Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and [...] "abandon the flesh", as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of unconditional love, romantic seduction and charm, and even, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> fails, threats and force.|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E

40|$|In South Asia, cricket {{has come}} to bear the promise of {{delivering}} lasting peace to a region tormented by a half century of strife. It may seem flippant {{to suggest that a}} sport will accomplish this <b>when</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>else</b> has failed, but consider the following. Mounting enmity between India and Pakistan is threatening to devour the entire region. Decades of failed diplomacy testify to the futility of conventional peace moves, and intransigent foreign policy positions bring the two neighbours ever closer to a nuclear flashpoint. India and Pakistan may speak the same language, but their deadlock cries out for a new medium of communication. Like marmalade, tweed jackets, and other things English, cricket is an acquired taste, which makes it slow to pick up but impossible to let go of. Introduced to the subcontinent in the 1800 s, by the 1920 s it was commanding great popularity in colonial India. In 1932 India became a Test playing country and, five years after the partition of 1947, Pakistan followed suit. In a cheerless, gloomy existence towards the bottom end of health and economic indices, the two nations found joy in cricket. It is easy to see why. Cricket provided a global forum for Pakistan and India to demonstrate talent and spirit, and defeat more advanced nations, such as England and Australia. Naturally enough, it cast a spell on the masses, became the embodiment of national self esteem, and turned cricket players into icons and celebrities...|$|R
