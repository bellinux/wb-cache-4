These two networks are majority-owned by Hutchison Asia Telecommunications, a wholly owned subsidiary of CK Hutchison. Its operations in Europe are run by a separate division, 3 Group Europe.

25|$|According to {{information}} provided in MediaTek's Q1 2014 financial results conference call, {{in terms of}} product mix, MediaTek's smartphone chipset shipments consisted of 5-10% single-core, 45-55% dual-core, 30-35% quad-core and 5-10% octa-core. Most octa-cores were sold in China, while the export market (chips sold directly to manufacturers {{in countries such as}} India) was dominated by dual-core. In terms of baseband technology (smartphones only), <b>WCDMA</b> was 50-55%, TD 25-30% and EDGE 10-15%. According to MediaTek's Q3 2014 conference call, dual-core shipments for entry-level devices continued to be important {{in the second half of}} 2014 with an increase in export shipments as MediaTek's competitiveness China was affected by the transition to 4G.|$|E
25|$|PMC-Sierra offers {{communication}} ICs for metro access, metro transport, FTTH/PON, Ethernet over SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network (OTN) {{and wireless}} base transceiver stations (BTS). PMC-Sierra sells products {{for what is}} known as Ethernet in the first mile, which generally uses a passive optical network to residential areas. PMC-Sierra semiconductor devices allow wireless service providers to deploy wireless mobile phone network equipment. This includes MIPS-based network processors for wireless back haul and radio frequency integrated circuits for wideband radio modules. The company's UniTRX chipsets are highly integrated, low-power RFICs for wideband radio modules that operate in the 400MHz to 4GHz frequency range. These solutions address the performance requirements of 3GPP and 3GPP2 macro base station radio transceivers and support multiple standards such as MC-GSM, cdma2000®, <b>WCDMA,</b> and LTE.|$|E
25|$|Telecom {{originally}} {{operated a}} TDMA (AMPS, Digital D-AMPS/TDMA) mobile network; this was superseded by its CDMA network. The TDMA network {{was turned off}} on 31 March 2007, {{and most of its}} customers migrated to CDMA. The CDMA EV-DO network was marketed as T3G, a 2 MB third-generation mobile system. Telecom announced on 8 June 2007 the intention to build a W-CDMA/UMTS network, to be called XT Mobile Network, based on <b>WCDMA</b> HSPA technology, to replace its current CDMA EV-DO network. The network was launched on 29 May 2009. The specifications of XT were chosen to bring it into line with a number of other networks in overseas territories, such as Telstra's Next G (in Australia); furthermore, 850MHz services can cover greater geographic distances and penetrate buildings more effectively than higher frequencies. The CDMA network ran in parallel with XT until it was shut down on 31 July 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 2007, the 025 D-AMPS ("TDMA") {{cellular}} network was closed down. Then on 8 June of that year, Telecom Mobile {{announced plans to}} build a hybrid W-CDMA/UMTS-CDMA 850MHz network, based on the <b>WCDMA</b> HSPA technology, to eventually replace its current CDMA EV-DO network. On 29 May 2009, Telecom launched its new network, branded as [...] "XT", to the public.|$|E
5000|$|System: GSM/EGSM 850/900/1800/1900 (quad band), <b>WCDMA</b> 900/2100 (E71-1 version), <b>WCDMA</b> 850/1900 (E71-2 version), <b>WCDMA</b> 850/2100 (E71-3 version) and HSDPA class 6, {{maximum speed}} 3.6 Mbit/s/384 kbit/s (DL/UL) ...|$|E
50|$|Since <b>WCDMA</b> often {{operates}} at higher frequencies than GSM (2,100 MHz {{as opposed to}} 900 MHz for GSM), the cell radius can be considerably smaller for <b>WCDMA</b> than for GSM cells as the path loss is frequency dependent. <b>WCDMA</b> now has networks operating in the 850-900 MHz band. In these networks, at these frequencies, the coverage of <b>WCDMA</b> is considered better {{than that of the}} equivalent GSM network.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a Radio Access Bearer (RAB) {{is to provide a}} {{connection}} segment using the <b>WCDMA</b> Radio Access Network (<b>WCDMA</b> RAN) for support of a UMTS bearer service.

50|$|The first pre-commercial trial {{network with}} 3G was {{launched}} by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001.

In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second <b>WCDMA</b> network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on <b>WCDMA.</b> 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on <b>WCDMA</b> and two more on the EV-DO standard.|$|E

5000|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) had {{prepared}} the specifications for a 3G mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed {{hard for the}} <b>WCDMA</b> (wideband CDMA) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support <b>WCDMA</b> over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using {{its own version of}} <b>WCDMA</b> called FOMA. Ericsson was a significant developer of the <b>WCDMA</b> version of GSM, while US-based chip developer Qualcomm promoted the alternative system CDMA2000, building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999 [...] when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm’s wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.|$|E
