[...] The following season Margate <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> top of the table in January, however, after much speculation Kinnear accepted the vacant manager's position at Dover Athletic.

500|$|Hubbard became Parsons' [...] "magical partner" [...] for a sex magic ritual {{involving}} {{that was}} intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess. Although they got on well as fellow occultists, tensions {{between the two men}} were apparent in more domestic settings. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard [...] "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when the two of them <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the table together, the hostility was almost tangible." [...] Despite the tensions between them, Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of [...] "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing.
