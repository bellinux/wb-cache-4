40|$|Abstract. Self-assembled {{monolayer}} (SAM) {{systems of}} alkanethiol and TTF-substituted alkanethiol molecules on Au substrate and metal nanoparticles are investigated. TTF-substituted alkanethiol molecules form charge transfer complex <b>SAM</b> <b>with</b> TCNQ molecules, where charge transfer (CT) rate becomes {{similar to that}} in bulk TTF TCNQ crystal. TTF-substituted alkanethiol <b>SAMs</b> <b>with</b> long alkyl chains shows Coulomb-blockade-type electron transport owing to the resistance of the long alkyl chain bridge. In Pt nanoparticles <b>with</b> alkanethiol <b>SAMs</b> on their surface, CT takes place from core Pt nanoparticle to surface SAMs, producing an electron deficient state in Pt core nanoparticle. Pd nanoparticles <b>with</b> <b>SAMs</b> of mixtures of alkanethiol and TTF-substituted alkanethiol molecules take a large reduction of the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility, which is brought about by CT. Key words. Nanoparticle – self-assembled monolayer – interface – quantum size effect – TTF donor – charge transfer. 1...|$|R
