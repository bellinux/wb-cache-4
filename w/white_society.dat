5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson to choose to do so. <b>White</b> <b>society</b> simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by <b>white</b> <b>society</b> and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into <b>white</b> <b>society</b> and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and <b>white</b> <b>society,</b> constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham clubs often {{featured}} exotic trappings, such as vivid {{lighting and}} murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated {{in his later}} stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians {{a sense of pride}} and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> They often played for elite <b>white</b> <b>society</b> audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Lucas {{attempted}} to branch out into non-minstrel material. In 1875, for instance, he performed alongside Emma and Anna Hyer in Out of Bondage, a musical {{drama about a}} freed slave who is made over to fit into upper-class, <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> He followed this by another stint in black minstrelsy, and in 1876, he was playing with Sprague's Georgia Minstrels, alongside both James A. Bland and Billy Kersands.|$|E
25|$|Recent works about Ford's {{depictions of}} Native Americans {{have argued that}} {{contrary}} to popular belief, his Indian characters spanned a range of hostile to sympathetic images from The Iron Horse to Cheyenne Autumn. His depiction of the Navajo in Wagon Master included their characters speaking the Navajo language. The distinguishing mark of Ford's Indian-themed Westerns is that his Native characters always remained separate and apart from <b>white</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} <b>white</b> <b>society</b> in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented the antithesis of the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E

25|$|Southern land owners regained {{control over}} {{almost all of}} the land they had claimed before the war. The {{national}} dialogue about land ownership as a key to success for freedpeople gave way (in the sphere of White politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of <b>White</b> <b>society</b> in the South, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.|$|E
25|$|By 1800, many {{political}} leaders {{were convinced that}} slavery was undesirable, and should eventually be abolished, and the slaves returned to their natural homes in Africa. The American Colonization Society, which was active in both North and South, tried to implement these ideas and established the colony of Liberia in Africa {{as a means to}} repatriate slaves out of <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> Prominent leaders included Henry Clay and President James Monroeâ€”who gave his name to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. However, after 1840 the abolitionists rejected the idea of repatriation to Africa.|$|E
25|$|During this period, U.S. Government policy {{focused upon}} {{acquiring}} Indian lands, restricting {{cultural and religious}} practices and sending Native American children to boarding schools. Progressives agreed that the situation was serious and that something {{needed to be done}} to educate and acculturate Native Americans to <b>white</b> <b>society,</b> but they differed as to education models and speed of assimilation. Reformist progressives, a coalition led by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Native American educators and Christian organizations, promoted rapid assimilation of children through off-reservation Indian boarding schools and immersion in white culture.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was largely}} {{accepted}} into <b>white</b> <b>society,</b> both {{on stage and}} off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone. As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones.

25|$|Malcolm begins {{religious}} conversion as {{a disciple}} of Elijah Muhammad.

Malcolm X preaches a doctrine of separation from <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> However, a pilgrimage to Mecca softens his beliefs, teaching him that Muslims come from all races, even whites, and he endeavors to break free of the strict dogma of the Nation of Islam, with tragic results. He is assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City.|$|E

25|$|Numerous 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century {{contemporaneous}} documents {{indicate that the}} policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aborigines were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact (population shrank from 1,250,000 in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930), whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population {{would be unable to}} sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in <b>white</b> <b>society,</b> and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} structure at St. Peter's changed in 1889, and this proved controversial. Most Jesuit missions in Montana were on Indian land, {{and it was}} common for white settlers {{in the area to}} pay tuition and have their children educated alongside Native Americans at Jesuit schools. The Jesuits believed this integrated educational system also prepared Native Americans for participation in <b>white</b> <b>society.</b> But as the borders of the Piegan Blackfeet territory shrank over time, St. Peter's Mission found itself standing on non-Indian ground. At the request of Bishop Brondel, Father Damiani made the highly controversial decision in 1889 to segregate the Native American children. Nonetheless, both whites and Native Americans credited the school with providing a clean, safe, warm place to live; three meals a day; and an excellent education. Piegan Blackfeet leaders later credited the mission with giving their tribe well-educated leadership other tribes lacked.|$|E
