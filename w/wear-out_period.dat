50|$|While {{the bathtub}} curve is useful, not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function, {{for example if}} units are retired or have {{decreased}} use during or {{before the onset of}} the <b>wear-out</b> <b>period,</b> they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve.|$|E
50|$|Every {{product has}} a failure rate, λ {{which is the}} number of units failing per unit time. This failure rate changes {{throughout}} the life of the product. It is the manufacturer’s aim to ensure that product in the “infant mortality period” does not get to the customer. This leaves a product with a useful life period during which failures occur randomly i.e., λ is constant, and finally a <b>wear-out</b> <b>period,</b> usually beyond the products useful life, where λ is increasing.|$|E
40|$|We study {{distributed}} {{detection and}} fusion in sensor networks with bathtub-shaped failure (BSF) {{rate of the}} sensors which may or not send data to the Fusion Center (FC). The reliability of semiconductor devices is usually represented by the failure rate curve (called the “bathtub curve”), which {{can be divided into}} the three following regions: initial failure period, random failure <b>period,</b> and <b>wear-out</b> failure <b>period.</b> Considering the possibility of the failed sensors which still work but in a bad situation, it is unreasonable to trust the data from these sensors. Based on the above situation, we bring in new characteristics to failed sensors. Each sensor quantizes its local observation into one bit of information which is sent to the FC for overall fusion because of power, communication, and bandwidth constraints. Under this sensor failure model, the Extension Log-likelihood Ratio Test (ELRT) rule is derived. Finally, the ROC curve for this model is presented. The simulation results show that the ELRT rule improves the robust performance of the system, compared with the traditional fusion rule without considering sensor failures...|$|R

A repairable mechanical system (as agricultural tractor) is subject to deterioration or repeated failure. In this study, the regression model was used to predict the failure rate of MF 399 tractor. The machine failure pattern was carefully studied and key factors affecting the failure rate were identified in five regions of Khouzestan province. The tractors grouped in four sub groups according to annual use hours and maintenance policies (corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance). Results showed that the majority of recorded failures were observed in the electrical system (20. 3 %) for each machine sub-group. Maximum and minimum annual repair and maintenance costs were related to other (tire, ring, ball bearing and operator seat) and brake system respectively. According to the results of the research, different annual use hours and maintenance policies affected failure rate. The tractors included in 300 - 1, 000 PM subgroup were mostly in the useful life period while the machines were towards the wearing out period of machine life for 300 - 1, 000 CM subgroup. The tractors maintained under 1, 200 - 2, 000 PM subgroup showed an obvious indication of <b>wear-out</b> <b>period</b> entrance, while the tractors were mostly in the <b>wear-out</b> <b>period</b> for the 1, 200 - 2, 000 CM sub group. The tractors included in 300 - 1, 000 annual use hours were commonly in a randomized breakdown period during their useful life but these tractors tend to enter the wear out period in the 1, 200 - 2, 000 annual use hours...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to analyze the}} risks of HV circuit-breakers, develop the probabilistic models, breakdown the cost structure and establish the improved maintenance strategies. Normally, HV circuit-breakers have been maintained by using manufacturers’ guidelines and experiences of operators. It is not well proved that such maintenance programs are effective regarding costs and performance. Although there are many literatures introducing the optimal maintenance for HV circuit-breakers, most of them propose only the ideas and mathematical models without the reference from the failure database. In this context it was challenging to design and investigate reliability and maintenance strategies {{in connection with the}} failure database. This thesis was constructed of three main parts to handle such problems. In the first part, the failure modes and effects analysis method was applied to determine the risks of components of HV circuit-breakers. The second part was to develop the probabilistic models to investigate the reliability of HV circuit-breakers and failure development. In the last part the cost structure of HV circuit-breakers was determined. In addition, the optimal maintenance strategies during useful and <b>wear-out</b> <b>period</b> were established. The failure database of HV circuit-breakers collected by the Institute of Power Systems, Darmstadt University of Technology had been implemented in all parts...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{power systems}} {{play a key}} role in {{production}} and services in both the industrial and commercial sectors and significantly affect the private lives of citizens. A major asset of any power delivery system is the transformer. Transformers represent extensive investment in any power delivery system, and because of the notable effect of a transformer outage on system reliability, careful management of this type of asset is critical. In North America, a large proportion of transformers is approaching the end of their life and should be replaced. In many cases, unexpected transformer outages can be catastrophic and cause both direct and indirect costs to be incurred by industrial, commercial, and residential sectors. Direct costs include but are not limited to loss of production, idle facilities and labour, damaged or spoiled product, and damage to equipment. For commercial customers, the effects may include damage to electrical and electronic equipment, and in some cases damage to goods. For residential customers, outages may cause food spoilage or damage to electrical equipment. In addition to direct costs, there are several types of indirect costs may also result, such as accidental injuries, looting, vandalism, legal costs, and increases in insurance rates. The main goal of this research was to assess the health and remaining lifetime of a working transformer. This information plays a very important role in the planning strategies of power delivery systems and in the avoidance of the potentially appalling effects of unexpected transformer outages. This thesis presents two different methods of assessing transformer end of life and three distinct methods of determining the health index and health condition of any working transformer. The first method of assessing transformer end of life is based on the use of Monte Carlo technique to simulate the thermal life of the solid insulation in a transformer, the failure of which is the main reason for transformer breakdown. The method developed uses the monthly average ambient temperature and the monthly solar clearness index along with their associated uncertainties in order to estimate the hourly ambient temperature. The average daily load curve and the associated uncertainties in each hourly load are then used to model the transformer load. The inherent uncertainties in the transformer loading and the ambient temperature are used to generate an artificial history of the life of the transformer, which becomes the basis for appraising its remaining lifetime. The second method of assessing transformer end of life is essentially an economic evaluation of the remaining time to the replacement of the transformer, taking into consideration its technical aspects. This method relies on the fact that a transformer fails more frequently during the <b>wear-out</b> <b>period,</b> thus incurring additional maintenance and repair costs. As well, frequent failures increase during this period also costs related to transformer interruptions. Replacing a transformer before it is physically damaged is therefore a wise decision. The bathtub failure model is used to represent the technical aspects of the transformer for the purposes of making the replacement decision. The uncertainties related to the time-to-failure, time-to-repair, time-to-switch, and scheduled maintenance time are modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, which enables the calculation of the repair costs and the cost of interruptions. The repair, operation, and interruption costs are then used to generate equivalent uniform annual costs (EUACs) for the existing transformer and for a new transformer, a comparison of which enables the determination of the most economical replacement year. The case studies conducted using both methods demonstrate their reliability for determining transformer end of life for assessing the appropriate time for replacement. Diagnostic test data for 90 working transformers were used to develop three methods of estimating the health condition of a transformer, which utilities and industries can use in order to assess the health of their transformer fleet. The first method is based on building a linear relation between all parameters of diagnostic data in order to determine a transformer health index, from which the health condition of the transformer can be evaluated. The second method depends on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in order to find the health condition of any individual transformer. The diagnostic data for the 90 working transformers together with the health indices calculated for them by means of a specialized transformer asset management and health assessment lab, were used to train an ANN. After the training, the ANN can estimate a health index for any transformer, which can be used in order to determine the health condition of the transformer. The third method is based on finding a relation between the input data and the given health indices (calculated by the specialized transformer asset management and health assessment lab) using the least squares method. This relation then can be used to find the health index and health condition of any working transformer. The health condition determined based on these methods shows excellent correlation with the given health condition calculated by the specialized transformer asset management and health assessment lab...|$|E
