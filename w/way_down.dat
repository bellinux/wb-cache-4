5|$|The Long Way Round team reunited in 2007 {{for another}} {{motorcycle}} trip from John o' Groats in Scotland to Cape Town in South Africa. The journey, entitled Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down,</b> lasted from 12 May until 5 August 2007. McGregor's brother Colin joined the motorcycle team {{during the early}} stages of the Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down</b> journey, and his father Jim also rode on sections of both Long Way Round and Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} NASA flight {{plan called for}} a crew rest period before extra-vehicular activity, Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong made his <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the ladder first.|$|E
5|$|McGregor is {{involved}} in charity work, including UNICEF UK since 2004 and GO Campaign. During the Long Way Round journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions saw some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during the Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down</b> trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did some work for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for the GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He {{has worked with the}} Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in Long <b>Way</b> <b>Down.</b> In 2012, he travelled with UNICEF immunization workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission.|$|E

5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E

5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime.

Long, thick hair has been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia and back before she worked her <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began {{the first of two}} African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After {{returning to}} the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia on 28 April.|$|E

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off {{on the island of}} Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the <b>way</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E

5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} <b>way</b> <b>down</b> from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, the cheek teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that {{there was no difference in}} width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
