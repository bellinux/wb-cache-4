25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every moment <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E

500|$|Harrington handed former SDS {{activist and}} New York City {{journalist}} Jack Newfield {{a speech by}} AFL–CIO President George Meany. Addressing the September 1972 Convention of the United Steelworkers of America, Meany ridiculed the Democratic Party Convention, which had been held in Miami: <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> from the gay-lib [...] {{people who want to}} legalize marriage between boys and boys, and between girls and girls... <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> from the people who looked like Jacks, acted like Jills, and had the odor of Johns [...] about them.

Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E
