25|$|The self-wringing mop {{is a type}} of mop {{designed}} to be <b>wrung</b> out without getting a user's hands wet. The first self-wringing mop was invented in 1990 by Joy Mangano. The mop head was created from 300 feet of cotton and was developed so {{that it was possible to}} be <b>wrung</b> out by turning a plastic handle above the mop head itself. It became widely used in America by the mid 1990s.|$|E

On December 30, 1905, Steunenberg, who had clashed with the WFM during several strikes, was killed by an explosion {{at his home in}} Caldwell, Idaho. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member who had once acted as Moyer's bodyguard, was arrested for the crime. Using coercion and intimidation (including restricted food rations and threats of immediate execution), Pinkerton agent James McParland <b>wrung</b> a 64-page confession from Orchard. The confession named Moyer and other WFM leaders as the instigators of the bombing plot.|$|E
25|$|A few in{{transitive}}s {{derive from}} transitive roots through the suffix -ek, {{though this is}} a fossilized suffix {{and is no longer}} productive. For example, dierek (to be found) from diar (to find); dilipek (for a thatch roof to be mended) from dilip (to mend a thatch roof). Sometimes this results in two intransitive derivations of a single transitive root, usually with a semantic nuance: transitive wengid (to wring), intransitive wengiweng (to wring/be <b>wrung),</b> intransitive wengidek (to be twisted); transitive widinge (to deceive), intransitive widing (to deceive/be deceived); intransitive widingek (to be deceitful). The suffix was apparently much more productive earlier in the language's history, even among active verbs.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Seckenheim (June 1462) saw {{the army}} of the Electoral Palatinate led by Frederick I, Elector Palatine and his ally Dieter von Isenburg face an invading army led by Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden, Ulrich V, Count of Württemberg, Louis I, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken and George of Baden, the Bishop of Metz. Without warning, Frederick {{suddenly}} struck at the invaders, trapping them in the fork of two major rivers. Though about 300 knights cut their way out, causing many non-combatant casualties, the Palatine forces were victorious. Frederick captured three of the enemy leaders and <b>wrung</b> ransoms and territorial concessions from them. Seckenheim is now part of the city of Mannheim in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The combat occurred during the Mainz Feud (Mainzer Stiftsfehde), part of the larger Bavarian War (1459–63).|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the period of {{re-examination}} of the British military presence in Canada and its ultimate withdrawal that the last invasion of Canada occurred. It was not carried out by any official US government force, but by an organization called the Fenians. The Fenian raids (1866–1871) were carried out by groups of Irish Americans, mostly Union Army veterans from the American Civil War who believed that by seizing Canada, concessions could be <b>wrung</b> from the British government regarding their policy in Ireland. The Fenians had also incorrectly assumed that Irish Canadians, who were quite numerous in Canada, would support their invasive efforts both politically and militarily. However, most Irish settlers in Upper Canada at that time were Protestant, {{and for the most part}} loyal to the British Crown.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were <b>wrung</b> out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath {{and went up to}} the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are <b>wrung</b> with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that the summit of the mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E

Disraeli was highly gratified by the dispute, which propelled him to general public notice for the first time. He did not defeat the incumbent Whig member, Henry Labouchere, but the Taunton constituency was regarded as unwinnable by the Tories. Disraeli kept Labouchere's majority down to 170, a good showing that put him {{in line for a}} winnable seat in the near future.|$|E

The region sees four distinct seasons. Rainfall is most likely between July and September, while May and June are the driest months. Orographic precipitation, which results from moisture <b>wrung</b> out of storm systems ascending the mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most of the summer and winter precipitation, and rainfall increases with higher elevation. Occasional aberrant northward excursions of the intertropical convergence zone may boost precipitation in some years.|$|E

On 16 October 2005, on the Day of Solidarity With Belarus, the political groups Zubr and Third Way Belarus encouraged all opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election. Their chosen candidate was Alexander Milinkevich. Lukashenko reacted by saying that anyone going to opposition protests would have their necks <b>wrung</b> [...] "as one might a duck". On 19 March 2006, exit polls showed Lukashenko winning a third term in a landslide, amid opposition reports of vote-rigging and fear of violence. The EcooM organisation gave Lukashenko 84.2% of the vote and Milinkevich just 2%, while the Belarusian Republican Youth Union gave Lukashenko 84.2% and Milinkevich 3.1%. The Gallup Organisation noted that EcooM and the Belarusian Republican Youth Union are government-controlled and both released their exit poll results before noon on election day even though voting stations did not close until 8pm.|$|E

2500|$|To produce pu'er, many {{additional}} {{steps are}} needed {{prior to the}} actual pressing of the tea. First, a specific quantity of dry máochá or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the final weight of the bingcha is weighed out.

A ticket, called a [...] "nèi fēi" [...] (...) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or {{in the midst of the}} leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth.

2500|$|This prosaic preoccupation, Călinescu notes, led Caragiale {{to depict}} the dust-covered mahala quarters, the passage of loaded trucks, and the clamor of {{boarding}} school girls walking down boulevards. Various works in this series also display their author's sympathy for the urban underclass, showing the beggars' losing battle with the natural elements, or unloved old women reduced to envying the happy couples they meet on the street. In more or less allusive poems, included by Cioculescu among the [...] "desacralizing" [...] texts, Caragiale also tests the limits of propriety, and questions the sexual taboos of his generation, from schoolgirls fantasizing about being kept women, to the moral severity imposed on churchgoers {{and the impact of}} sexual inhibition on the subconscious. The poet's sensibility for such themes touched not just his choice of subjects, but also his appreciation of other poems. In a 1922 letter to critic Tudor Vianu, Ion Barbu recalled that Caragiale's enthusiasm for Răsturnica, which can be read as a grotesque but compassionate homage to a dead prostitute, far exceeded his own: in Barbu's definition, Răsturnica was [...] "that smut which <b>wrung</b> tears from Luchi Caragiale".|$|E

During the same period, the field ambulance treated almost {{an equal number of}} patients needing dressings and for minor ailments. Some were kept in hospital for a few days. In five weeks, the field ambulance cared for the equivalent of two regiments or two-thirds of the total brigade. According to Falls, [...] "in general, however, the Force's standard of health was very high." [...] These minor ailments included very painful boils which were inevitable in the dust, heat and sweat of the Jordan Valley. They often started where shirt collars rubbed the backs of necks, then spread {{to the top of the}} head and possibly the arm pits and buttocks. These boils were treated by lancing or hot foments sometimes applied hourly and requiring a day or two in hospital. Foments were made from a wad of lint wrapped in a towel heated in boiling water, <b>wrung</b> as dry as possible then quickly slapped straight on the boil.

During this period Costello sought help from a psychiatrist, who advised him {{to distance himself from}} old associates such as Genovese and spend more time with politicians. In the early 1950s, U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee began investigating organized crime in New York in the Kefauver hearings. The Committee summoned numerous mobsters to testify, but they refused to answer questions at the hearings. The mobsters uniformly cited the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a legal protection against self-incrimination. However, when Costello was summoned, he agreed to answer questions at the hearings and not take the Fifth Amendment. As part of the agreement to testify, the Special Committee and the U.S. television networks agreed not to broadcast Costello's face. During the questioning, Costello nervously refused to answer certain questions and skirted around others. When the Committee asked Costello, [...] "What have you done for your country Mr. Costello?", he famously replied, [...] "Paid my tax!". The TV cameras, unable to show Costello's face, instead focused on his hands, which Costello <b>wrung</b> nervously while answering questions. Costello eventually walked out of the hearings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{biography}} about Douglas Bader by Paul Brickhill, Reach for the Sky, {{was published}} in 1954. Some 172,000 copies were sold {{in the first few}} months alone. The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain. Brickhill had originally offered Bader fifty per cent of all proceeds, sealing the arrangement with a handshake. As sales soared, Bader became concerned that, after tax, he would make very little, and he insisted on a new deal, in writing. So, Brickhill agreed to make him a one-off payment from his company Brickhill Publications Limited of £13,125, the majority of which would be for [...] 'expenses', and tax-free, with only a small portion for 'services' and therefore taxable (£ today). The Inland Revenue subsequently waived any tax liabilities on Bader's earnings. After film director Daniel M. Angel bought the film rights and teamed up with Lewis Gilbert to write the screenplay, Bader came to regret the limiting new deal he had <b>wrung</b> from Brickhill. He was so bitter, he refused to attend the premiere, and only saw the film eleven years later, on television. He never spoke to Brickhill again, and never answered his letters. The feature film of the same title was released in 1956, starring Kenneth More as Bader, topping the box office in Britain that year.|$|E

Lloyd George [...] "read [...] all night", and mentioned it to Churchill, who wrote in 1928 that it held [...] "a permanent place in war literature", and described it as [...] "one of those cries of pain <b>wrung</b> from the fighting troops ... like the poems of Siegfried Sassoon [...] should be read in each generation, so {{that men and women}} may rest under no illusions about what war means". H. A. L. Fisher called it [...] "a masterpiece", whilst Montgomery thought it [...] "the best story of front line war"; from a purely literary perspective, it received a very positive review from Arnold Bennett. Other reviews described it as [...] "the best book published about life in the trenches" [...] (New Statesman) and [...] "one of the most interesting and moving English war books" [...] (Athenæum). However, it was not a commercial success. The war was not the most popular of themes among the reading public in 1919, and the book saw only limited sales; it was not reissued for another five years, with a second edition appearing in January 1924. Assisted by Herbert's growing popularity as a writer, it gained in popularity during the war novel boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s – five editions between 1928 and 1936 – but never reached the fame that many of its supporters feel it deserved.
