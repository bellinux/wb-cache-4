5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leucopterus and M. l. edouardi {{are both}} {{generally}} smaller than their mainland relatives, and both subspecies {{tend to have}} smaller family groups that consist of only one male and one female, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> helper bird. While the island subspecies and mainland species {{have been found to}} have similar social structure, breeding pairs on both islands have, on average, smaller clutches, longer incubation times, and fewer live fledglings. Additionally, while M. l. leuconotus is considered of least concern by the IUCN due to its widespread occurrence, both island subspecies are considered vulnerable by the Australian government due to their delicate nesting sites that are easily disturbed by human construction and habitation.|$|E

Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} {{thousand}} years of Khmer history, Cambodia was ruled {{by a series of}} Hindu kings <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> Buddhist king, such as Jayavarman I of Funan, Jayavarman VII, who became a mahayanist, and Suryavarman I. A variety of Buddhist traditions co-existed peacefully throughout Cambodian lands, under the tolerant auspices of Hindu kings and the neighboring Mon-Theravada kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|The sixteen books, in prose <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> {{excursion}} into poetry, can {{be categorized}} into two parts: Books 1-9, which deal with Norse mythology, and Books 10-16, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with Gorm the Old, the first factual documented King of Denmark. The last three books (14-16), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against Slavic peoples (the Northern Crusades), are very valuable {{for the history of}} West Slavic tribes (Polabian Slavs, Pomeranians) and Slavic paganism. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple at Rügen Island.|$|E
60|$|So far the day {{had been}} typical of the Autumn season, {{somewhat}} gray, <b>with</b> only <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> showing of the sun. Now, however, it became rapidly darker, and presently a few flakes of snow sifted down through the air.|$|R

25|$|Cutting {{down his}} pace {{and the length}} of his run up, Lillee now {{concentrated}} on moving the ball off the seam <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> faster or slower ball for variation. During the season of his return to official cricket, Lillee collected 35 Test wickets in six matches against the West Indies and England, and gave Australia's bowling attack stability while the selectors experimented with the team. In the World Series Cup, his changed style helped to bring him 20 wickets (at 12.7 average) in eight ODIs, including 4/12 against West Indies and 4/28 against England, both at the SCG. However, the tour of Pakistan that followed was ruined for Lillee by flat batting pitches prepared by local curators to blunt his effectiveness. He managed just three wickets in three Tests.|$|E
25|$|SR 574 {{begins at}} a stop-controlled T-intersection at SR 566 in {{northern}} Seneca Township. The route heads northeast through mostly forest <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> driveway for lake access. The road curves {{to the northwest}} after entering Wayne Township, passing the main entrance road for the Seneca Lake State Park. Shortly after the access road, the state route descends in elevation to a small village with a cluster of houses and turns onto {{the top of the}} Senecaville Dam. The route enters Guernsey County and is now {{on the top of the}} earthen dam. After crossing the dam's main spillway, SR 574 intersects the driveway to the Senecaville Lake Fish Hatchery. The route finishes crossing the dam, passes a small baseball field, and ends at SR 313 in Richland Township.|$|E
25|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} consists {{mainly of}} mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{seems to have}} become a key prey item. The black-chested buzzard-eagle is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of the rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Among the native fauna degus (Octodon) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus) are important prey, but mammals as formidable as a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) – two to over three times as heavy as the birds and certainly not defenceless – are occasionally hunted and killed by this hawk. Its diet is rounded off <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> bird – including carnivorous species like the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and sizeable prey such as Penelope guans or the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) –, large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened. It is {{near the top of}} the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the first}} few summers, the number of shows was {{gradually}} increased until a peak of eight productions was reached in 1938. By 1940, the count was stabilized at six titles per season through the early '60s, <b>with</b> only <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> anomalous number.|$|R

500|$|The {{popularity}} of Wheel of Fortune has led {{it to become}} a worldwide franchise, with over forty known adaptations in international markets outside the United States. Versions of the show have existed in such countries as Australia, Denmark, France, , Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The American version of Wheel has honored its international variants <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> theme of special weeks known as [...] "Wheel Around the World", the inaugural episode of which aired when the 23rd syndicated season premiered on September 12, 2005.|$|E
500|$|For many years, Weinberg's gear {{included}} Ludwig and Pearl Drums and Zildjian cymbals; he subsequently {{switched to}} DW Drums, but continues to use Zildjian cymbals. He also uses Remo heads and previously using Regal Tip drumsticks and brushes, he now uses Vater drumsticks, notably the 5A Nude wood tip model and Wire Tap brushes. His setup {{has always been}} simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal {{and a pair of}} hi-hats, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> third crash: [...] "I've got four drums.

5000|$|Many of the artist's older {{songs are}} given an updated, stadium rock sound; Jones plays mostly piano and organ, <b>with</b> only <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> hint of his {{trademark}} synthesizers.

500|$|In 1938 the {{magazine}} was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor. [...] Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, {{the magazine}} is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s. [...] Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then numerous {{attempts have been made}} to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973. [...] The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy & Horror because of licensing issues, with the original title returning in 1998. [...] As of 2016, the most recent published issue was dated Spring 2014.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and The Independent {{have each}} {{released}} two separate reviews; {{they were more}} mixed. Sam Wollaston enjoyed the first two episodes, but called it a [...] "pathetic male fantasy." [...] Andrew Anthony has said that [...] "no scene lasted more than about 25 seconds {{in the first two}} episodes and no element of plot information was left unspoken. The dialogue is close to pure exposition, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> clunkily macho line thrown in as a concession to dramatic atmosphere. Show, don't tell, say the screenwriting gurus. This was show and tell." [...] From The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe stated the series may be enjoyed by those who like explosions and Spooks-like operations. Rhiannon Harries was almost negative in her review, believing Strike Back was [...] "in almost every respect, a terrible piece of television drama," [...] although part of Harries enjoyed watching it. Harries noted that Luther was more recommended.|$|E
500|$|Musicians on the {{battlefield}} were drummers and buglers, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> fifer. [...] Buglers had to learn forty-nine separate calls just for infantry, with more needed for cavalry. [...] These ranged from battle commands to calls for meal time. [...] Some of these required musicians were drummer boys not even in their teens, which allowed an adult man to instead be a foot soldier. [...] The most notable of these under aged musicians was John Clem, also known as [...] "Johnny Shiloh". [...] Union drummers wore white straps to support their drums. [...] The drum and band majors wore baldrics to indicate their status; after the war, this style would be emulated in civilian bands. [...] Drummers would march {{to the right of}} a marching column. [...] Similar to buglers, drummers had to learn 39 different beats: fourteen for general use, and 24 for marching cadence. [...] However, buglers were given greater importance than drummers.|$|E

60|$|Lawson again led the {{way across}} the square in search of the commissioner's office. The large, bare waiting-room was filled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dozen or more redmen, all wearing new blue suits and wide black hats.

It was plain they were expecting <b>an</b> {{audience}} <b>with</b> the great white chief.|$|R

500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, on the 150th {{anniversary of}} Brazilian independence, PedroI's remains (though not his heart) {{were brought to}} Brazil—as he had {{requested}} in his will—accompanied by much fanfare and with honors due to a head of state. His remains were reinterred in the Monument to the Independence of Brazil, {{along with those of}} Maria Leopoldina and Amélie, in the city of São Paulo. Years later, Neill Macaulay said that [...] "riticism of Dom Pedro was freely expressed and often vehement; it prompted him to abdicate two thrones. His tolerance of public criticism and his willingness to relinquish power set Dom Pedro apart from his absolutist predecessors and from the rulers of today's coercive states, whose lifetime tenure is as secure as that of the kings of old." [...] Macaulay affirmed that [...] "uccessful liberal leaders like Dom Pedro may be honored <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> stone or bronze monument, but their portraits, four stories high, do not shape public buildings; their pictures are not borne in parades {{of hundreds of thousands of}} uniformed marchers; no '-isms' attach to their names." ...|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1890s, Edwin became {{head of the}} Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company {{and then}} the Model Land Company, both of which sold land for the {{railroad}}s. [...] In 1900, after twenty years living in Lake Worth, {{the family moved to}} Flamingo in Monroe County, near the Everglades. [...] Edwin had heard that railroad tycoon Henry Flagler planned to build his railroad through the area, and that the then primitive city of Flamingo would flourish as a result; Flagler later changed his mind, deciding to build to Key West instead. [...] Guy and his brother, who continued working as guides and hunters, each received {{a quarter of a mile}} of land on Florida Bay as part of their father's deal with the Model Land Company. [...] While working variously as a postman, farmer and boatman during his 20s, Guy continued to augment his income <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>occasional</b> plume hunt. [...] In 1899, he married the young widow Sophronia ("Fronie") Vickers Kirvin from Key West. [...] Their first child, Morrell, was born a year later.|$|E
