The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> this money ended up – he doubted that much of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E

25|$|The {{two primary}} grapes of the Cote de Nuits, pinot noir and Chardonnay, are {{believed}} to be indigenous to the Burgundy wine region. Through centuries of trial and error, the two varieties have shown to produce the most consistent quality in the region. Broadly speaking, pinot noir tends to be planted in areas with high proportion of marl while Chardonnay is most often found in vineyards that are dominated by limestone. As the Cote de Nuits has many areas with significant amounts of marl, pinot noir is the dominant planting in the area. As a grape variety, pinot noir is very reflective of the terroir it is grown in which, coupled with the highly variable soils of the area, can cause two Cote de Nuits wine producers in the same year and by the same producer to be dramatically different due to <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> they were grown.|$|E

500|$|It {{was decided}} that the police, failing to notice that the {{presented}} security badges were fake, had given [...] "tacit" [...] permission for the group to enter the restricted zone. Further, {{the actions of the}} police on the scene, who themselves may have been unaware of <b>where,</b> <b>exactly,</b> the legally restricted area began, caused the Chaser team to proceed much further {{into the heart of the}} security zone than they had intended to or realised. This meant their breach of the law had happened largely due to an exculpating mistake of fact on the part of Morrow, who intended to end the stunt before crossing into restricted territory, but who received no explicit indications as to where that territory began − and was indeed waved farther into it by the police. The ABC welcomed this development; Morrow commented: [...] "I think it's just great that justice hasn't been done". The police remained unapologetic.|$|E
500|$|The {{pterosaur}} {{wing membrane}} {{is divided into}} three basic units. The first, called the propatagium ("first membrane"), was the forward-most part of the wing and attached between the wrist and shoulder, creating the [...] "leading edge" [...] during flight. This membrane may have incorporated the first three fingers of the hand, as evidenced in some specimens. The brachiopatagium ("arm membrane") was the primary component of the wing, stretching from the highly elongated fourth finger of the hand to the hind limbs (though <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> on the hind limbs it anchored is controversial and may have varied between species, see below). Finally, at least some pterosaur groups had a membrane that stretched between the legs, possibly connecting to or incorporating the tail, called the uropatagium; the extent of this membrane is not certain, as studies on Sordes seem to suggest that it simply connected the legs but did not involve the tail (rendering it a cruropatagium). It is generally agreed though that non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs had a broader uro/cruropatagium, with pterodactyloids only having membranes running along the legs.|$|E
500|$|Holland {{referred}} to Veronica's line [...] "I don't want his apology" [...] {{in the scene}} in which Logan assaults Gorya Sorokin as indicative {{of one of the}} main themes of the series: [...] "She's not interested in apologies. She's driven by a nihilistic need for action and payback." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN wrote that the scene [...] "had an air of ambiguity that could be interpreted in many ways." [...] The reviewer elaborated that Veronica's smile could have indicated further romantic interest or that Logan might have been killed in retaliation for attacking Gorya. Zacharek stated that the episode's ending [...] " [...] truncated, unfinished. It gave us no clear signposts telling us <b>where,</b> <b>exactly,</b> these characters are headed next, where they'll end up." [...] Holland said that the theme of the final scene [...] "seemed emphatically clear and killingly accurate. Life's a bitch until you die." [...] Goldman wrote that the ending was fitting for the series: [...] "Veronica Mars wasn't exactly a show that was driven by happy thoughts or events, even though we wouldn't have minded the characters ending up happy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{final round}} of {{negotiations}} started at the royal kraal {{on the morning of}} 30 October. The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering [...] "the whole country". When the izinDuna demurred, Thompson insisted, [...] "No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the izinDuna, who did not seem to know where these places were. [...] "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through [...] "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.|$|E
500|$|Tainton and {{the other}} white opponents of the {{concession}} contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E
500|$|Back at Nico’s apartment, Bruno {{reveals that}} the stolen key was the Key of Solomon; Susarro would need it to access a special armillary in an ancient building, the {{location}} of which is unknown. Whilst looking at the Omega Stone, George realises he saw the same symbol, {{in exactly the same}} style as the key, in the Congo, leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate. [...] The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it, and manage to evade Petra, who had come after them and the site. [...] Upon returning to Paris, the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico's apartment was ransacked, and taken to Prague, leaving Nico to find out <b>where</b> <b>exactly</b> by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues, quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro. [...] Whilst there, they manage to track down Bruno, along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt, and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist, and known to Susarro. He promptly returns to Paris to confront them, while Bruno is taken to Egypt. George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well, and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based, only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded. Despite finding bodies, George manages to find survivors of the attack, including the Preceptor for the chapter's temple. The Preceptor tasks George with stopping Susarro, revealing the key was taken from them, before handing over a third stone key needed to pinpoint the armillary, bearing a psi symbol on it, and knighting George.|$|E
