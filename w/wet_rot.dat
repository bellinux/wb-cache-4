5|$|Lord Wraxall's widow, Ursula, Lady Wraxall, {{was left}} with two {{children}} under two years of age, little income, and a large estate. Noted for her efficiency and practicality, when the clock tower, {{the focal point of}} the house, needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and <b>wet</b> <b>rot,</b> she simply had it disassembled, stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed.|$|E
25|$|After the war, John Chattell (born 1931) {{bought the}} estate, {{dividing}} the house into eleven apartments. However, dry and <b>wet</b> <b>rot</b> became increasingly problematic {{and the house}} uninhabitable; its listed building description (written after a visit in November 1953) noted that it was already 'empty and boarded up', and placed it at Grade II status (it was later upgraded to Grade I). In 1973, rock band Led Zeppelin bought Hammerwood at auction {{with the hope of}} turning it into a music centre, recording studio and flats. Although the house did make an appearance {{at the beginning of the}} film The Song Remains the Same, their plans did not progress. Significant vandalism saw three tons of lead removed from the roof, compromising it in fourteen different places and allowing thousands of gallons of water to leak into the structure. The progression of the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>rot</b> accelerated, leading the house to become increasingly structurally unsafe (with the collapse of a first-floor bathroom which had previously been held aloft by its own plumbing leading to the bath installed therein falling into the Drawing Room below, and overflowing onto its 18th century parquet flooring). The house was subsequently boarded up in 1976, and put on sale in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Persons with ONJ {{may have}} either {{necrotic}} bone or bone marrow {{that has been}} slowly strangulated or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a fibrous marrow since fibres can more easily live in nutrient starved areas, a greasy, dead fatty marrow (<b>wet</b> <b>rot),</b> a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone infarct, a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.|$|E

50|$|Most {{specimens}} will {{be found}} under <b>wet</b> <b>rotting</b> logs of conifer forests, or clinging to the underside of stones. They seem not to walk about during the day, and generally move rather sluggish. Adult specimens are found at the earliest in mid-autumn, and even later at higher elevations. As they depend on high humidity, {{it is difficult to}} transport them alive for further study.|$|R
50|$|This species breeds in wet {{tropical}} areas. Up to 50 eggs can be laid by {{a female}} and these will take 10 to 14 days to hatch. The larva {{can be seen in}} the egg before emerging.

2500|$|In the 20th {{century the}} {{population}} of Keynsham grew, {{partly due to the}} construction of the Somerdale Factory. Douglas Percival Hatchard, who had taken over as the vicar in 1901, [...] continued work on the church school and raised money for the restoration of the church. Heating was provided by the Keynsham Electric Light Company from their plant next to the church. The mission church at Chewton Keynsham continued as a dependent chapel and was often served by lay readers. After World War I a memorial was built. The vicar during World War II was Vernon Graham Havergal Shaw. He was pacifist which brought him into conflict with members of the church council and churchwardens as they thought prayers should be said for the troops, however the vicar disagreed. He left the parish in 1945 and was replaced by Trevor Wright, who was in charge when further problems were uncovered in the church during the 1950s. The woodwork was affected by deathwatch beetle and <b>wet</b> <b>rot</b> and repair work costing over £15,000 was needed. Mervyn Wedgewood took over as the vicar in 1956 as the town expanded further. He led the establishment of new classes and groups for the population and {{the construction of a new}} church dedicated to St Francis. The old church rooms were demolished to make way for a bypass, in the 1960s and the compensation money used for the construction of a new church hall and vicarage. During the 1970s a team ministry was established.|$|E
6000|$|We {{entered this}} haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an {{introductory}} passage into a melancholy little square that {{looked to me}} like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and <b>wet</b> <b>rot</b> and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, [...] "Try Barnard's Mixture." ...|$|E

Whereby German affairs are come to be greatly overgrown with funguses in our Time; and give symptoms of dry and of <b>wet</b> <b>rot,</b> wherever handled. George I., we say, had his Tabagie; and other German Sovereigns had: but none of them turned it to a Political Institution, as Friedrich Wilhelm did. The thrifty man; finding it would serve in that capacity withal. He had taken it up as a commonplace solace and amusement: it is a reward for doing strenuously the day's heavy labors, to wind them up in this manner, in quiet society of friendly human faces, into a contemplative smoke-canopy, slowly spreading into the realm of sleep and its dreams. Friedrich Wilhelm was a man of habitudes; his evening Tabagie became a law of Nature to him, constant as the setting of the sun. Favorable circumstances, quietly noticed and laid hold of by the thrifty man, developed this simple evening arrangement of his into a sort of Smoking Parliament, small but powerful, where State-consultations, in a fitful informal way, took place; and the weightiest affairs might, by dexterous management, cunning insinuation and manoeuvring from those that understood the art and the place, he bent this way or that, and ripened towards such issue as was desirable.|$|E

The Austrian Head-Commissioner has 5 pounds (thirty thalers) a day; but he is an elderly fat gentleman, pursy, scant of breath; cannot stand the rapid galloping about, and thousand-fold inspecting and detailing; leaves it all to Nussler; who goes like the wind. Thus, for example, Nussler dictates, at evening from his saddle, the mutual Protocol of the day's doings; Old Pursy sitting by, impatient for supper, and making no criticisms. Then at night, Nussler privately mounts again; privately, by moonlight, gallops over the ground they are to deal with next day, and takes notice of everything. No wonder the boundary-pillars, set up in such manner, which stand to this day, bear marks that Prussia here and there has had fair play!--Poor Nussler has no fixed appointment yet, except one of about 100 pounds a year: in all my travels I have seen no man of equal faculty at lower wages. Nor did he ever get any signal promotion, or the least exuberance of wages, this poor Nussler;--unless it be that he got trained to perfect veracity of workmanship, {{and to be a}} man without dry-rot in the soul of him; which indeed is incalculable wages. Income of 100 pounds a year, and no dry-rot in the soul of you anywhere; income of 100,000 pounds a year, and nothing but dry and <b>wet</b> <b>rot</b> in the soul of you (ugly appetites unveracities, blusterous conceits,--and probably, as symbol of all things, a pot-belly to your poor body itself): Oh, my friends! ...|$|E

This process makes hoses smaller and somewhat rigid, thus allowing more fire hose to be packed or loaded into the same compartment on a fire fighting apparatus.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – Information on {{the role}} of mites in the genus Tarsonemus Canestrini and Fanzago, 1876 in the {{epidemiology}} of apple core <b>rots</b> (<b>wet</b> and dry) is limited. The aims of this study were to (1) assess the effect of different apple developmental stages (buds, blossoms, 4 -cm diameter fruit, mature fruit and mummies) on the relative abundance of Tasonemus mites, (2) determine if there is a tendency of Tarsonemus mites to be associated with <b>wet</b> core <b>rot</b> (WCR) and dry core rot (DCR) apples, and (3) evaluate the suitability of three core-rot-associated fungal genera as food sources for the mites. Investigations into four orchards, two core-rot-susceptible (Red Delicious) and two-core-rot resistant (Granny Smith), revealed that Tarsonemus mites were the dominant mite genus in all the apple developmental stages in all orchards. The Tarsonemus mites had the highest incidence in mature fruits and mummies in all the orchards. In the cores of healthy and DCR Red Delicious fruits, Tarsonemus mites had a high occurrence of 56 % and 84 %, respectively. In these fruits, a significant association was found between DCR and the presence of mites in the core.

This yield {{reduction}} is mainly due to physical damage to new shoots re-growing after cutting. There is a subsequent reduction in root stored carbohydrates and reduced plant vigor. Soil Compaction can be a contributing factor to reduced yield. Compaction is especially evident under irrigated sandy loam soils and on heavy soils that are driven upon when <b>wet.</b> Crown <b>rot</b> diseases increase when there is damage to plants such as the mechanical damage caused by wheel traffic.

Earlier traffic treatments resulted in much less damage (5 - 8 %). New “grazing and wheel traffic resistant ” varieties that were selected by testing under wheel traffic conditions have less traffic caused yield reduction than many of the standard varieties. The percentage of field area exposed to harvest traffic varies with the type and size of equipment, the need for extra trips to turn hay in wet conditions, and the configuration of the equipment to track over previous equipment tracks.
