40|$|NMi has {{developed}} a sealed-water calorimeter for absorbed dose to water measurements in high-energy photon beams. The calorimeter has as a unique feature that it is transportable, and can therefore {{be used to determine}} absorbed dose rates on location in accelerator beams. The electronic detection circuit of the calorimeter is based on a method that involves a high-precision digital multimeter (DMM), rather than on a more traditional technique that employs Wheatstone bridges. To test its performance the NMi <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> was compared directly with the absorbed-dose-to-water standard based on the NMi graphite calorimeter for 60 Co gamma radiation. A preliminary evaluation of this comparison yields a value of 1. 0010 ± 0. 0051 (1 σ) for the ratio of the dose rate determined with the <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> compared to that derived from the graphite calorimeter. Furthermore the NMi <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> was tested in high-energy photon beams, measurements of absorbed-dose-to-water rates were performed at the BNM-LNHB with a Saturne 43 accelerator for 6, 12, and 20 MV photon beams. By calibrating a set of 5 NE 2611 A chambers against the <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter,</b> beam quality correction factors kQ were derived that agreed very well with the literature. Presently, a NCS subcommittee Uniformity Dosimetry Protocols is working on implementing absorbed-dose-based Codes of Practice (CoPs) for external beam radiotherapy in Belgium and The Netherlands. These CoPs will be consistent with international recommendations and replace the current CoPs based on air kerma calibration factors. In agreement with the recommendation given in IAEA TRS- 398, that preferably experimental kQ values should be used, the subcommittee is presently performing kQ measurements in nine representative clinical photon beams with the portable NMi <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> for four different graphite-walled ionization chamber types. First preliminary results of the kQ measurements will be presented...|$|E

Several laboratories have developed techniques to calibrate these sensors but with varying procedures and apparatus. No recent work has been conducted to check the degree of agreement between the calibrations from different laboratories for solar applications [1] [2]. This paper describes the results of the comparison of 4 sensors: 3 Gardon heat flux gauges and a <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> were compared at the Big Solar Furnace in Odeillo for varying heat flux density and incoming angles up to 1500 kW/m 2 and 25 to 80 °. Two Vatell commercial gauges had been calibrated with an electric heated radiative plate. One of them had been further corrected for the spectral distribution difference between the radiative plate (mostly infrared) and concentrated solar applications (mostly visible) [3]. One HyCal commercial gauge had been calibrated against a Kendall water-cooled absolute radiometer. The <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> was representing cavity absolute radiometers exhibiting total apparent absorptivity. We have observed an agreement within 10 % of all the sensors, but with a separation in two subgroups: on one hand the radiative plate calibrated gauges agreeing each around 1 %, solar corrected or not, and on another hand the radiometer calibrated gauge and the <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> Additional experimental findings concerning angular response are also presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{are testing}} a {{high-resolution}} ultrasonic thermometer with a noise {{floor at the}} µK level to improve the accuracy of radiation dosimetry methods that rely upon water calorimetry as a primary standard. Conventional <b>water</b> <b>calorimeters,</b> based upon the original design of Domen, detect temperature changes in irradiated water with thermistors that are sealed inside a thin sheath of glass. Recovering absorbed dose to water from these measurements requires the application of correction factors {{to compensate for the}} effects of self-heating of the thermistors, of excess heat induced in nonwater materials by the radiation, and of heat transfer due to dose gradients within the phantom. The ultrasonic approach dispenses with nonwater materials inside the water phantom, thereby eliminating or reducing sources of excess heat and the corresponding dose gradients. The prototype instrument, which involves a single ultrasonic transducer and an analog pulsed phase-locked loop, has been tested in 60 Co, and initial measurements have yielded values of absorbed dose to water that are within 10 % of the nominal value, with a temperature sensitivity of 10 μK. A digital prototype of this instrument can improve temperature sensitivity by an order-of-magnitude and make practical two dimensional dose profiles in water by using tomographic reconstruction of multiple-channel ultrasonic projections...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of the <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> direct measurement of absorbed dose in water becomes possible. This could lead to the establishment of an absorbed dose rather than an exposure related standard for ionization chambers for high energy electrons and photons. In changing to an absorbed dose standard it is necessary to investigate the effect of different parameters, among which are the energy dependence, the air volume, wall thickness and material of the chamber. The effect of these parameters is experimentally studied and presented for several commercially available chambers and one experimental chamber, for photons up to 25 MV and electrons up to 20 MeV, using a <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> as the absorbed dose standard and the most recent formalism to calculate the absorbed dose with ion chambers. ^ For electron beams, the dose measured with the calorimeter was 1 % lower than the dose calculated with the chambers, independent of beam energy and chamber. ^ For photon beams, the absorbed dose measured with the calorimeter was 3. 8 % higher than the absorbed dose calculated from the chamber readings. Such differences were found to be chamber and energy independent. ^ The results for the photons were found to be statistically different from the results with the electron beams. Such difference could not be attributed to a difference in the calorimeter response. ...|$|E

Additionally, it is important that different proton therapy centers be able to correctly compare results with one another, necessitating a global standard for accurately determining proton dose. ^ Historically, radiation dosimetry has depended on a quantity w, the average energy required to produce an ion pair. This quantity has been used both in photon and proton radiation dosimetry. The value for photons is fairly well known (∼ 0. 2 % uncertainty), but the proton value contributes significantly (∼ 4 %) when used for proton dosimetry. ^ Dose measurements were made with a combination of ionization chamber and <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> in order to determine the w value in water for proton beams delivered by the Indiana University Cyclotron. A unique calorimeter was developed for this research in which an existing design was modified by eliminating an air jacket in order to reduce the bulkiness of the calorimeter. A novel method was developed and implemented to correct for heat loss which improved the accuracy of the calorimeter in the high intensity proton beam of the cyclotron. ^ Three separate experiments were performed at 164 MeV, 162 MeV and 133 MeV, with several measurements done at each energy.

Methods: A functioning calorimeter prototype was constructed in-house and used to obtain reproducible measurements in clinical accelerator-based 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV electron beams. Corrections for the radiation field perturbation due {{to the presence of}} the glass calorimeter vessel were calculated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The conductive heat transfer due to dose gradients and nonwater materials was also accounted for using a commercial finite element method software package. Results: The relative combined standard uncertainty on the ESWcal dose was estimated to be 0. 50 % for the 9 - 20 MeV beams and 1. 00 % for the 6 MeV beam, demonstrating that the development of a water calorimeter-based standard for electron beams over such a wide range of clinically relevant energies is feasible. The largest contributor to the uncertainty was the positioning (Type A, 0. 10 %- 0. 40 %) and its influence on the perturbation correction (Type B, 0. 10 %- 0. 60 %). As a preliminary validation, measurements performed with the ESWcal in a 6 MV photon beam were directly compared to results derived from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) photon beam standard <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> These two independent devices were shown to agree well within the 0. 43 % combined relative uncertainty of the ESWcal for this beam type and quality. Absorbed dose electron beam quality conversion factors were measured using the ESWcal for the Exradin A 12 and PTW Roos ionization chambers. The photon-electron conversion factor, kecal, for the A 12 was also experimentally determined. Nonstatistically significant differences of up to 0. 7 % were found when compared to the calculation-based factors listed in the AAPM's TG- 51 protocol.

Although the CP violating phase can be measured accurately by studying νµ → νe and νµ → νe oscillations at HK, there appear multiple solution ambiguities which can be solved only by determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the twofold ambiguity in the mixing angle. We show that very long baseline experiments with higher energy beams from J-PARC and a possible huge <b>Water</b> Čerenkov <b>Calorimeter</b> detector proposed in Beijing can resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy. If such a detector can be built in China, future experiments with a muon storage ring neutrino factory at J-PARC will be able to lift all the degeneracies in the three neutrino model parameters. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{irradiation}} {{facility and}} {{the characteristics of}} the measurement devices are described that are capable to determine the absorbed dose to water in an intense mixed neutronphoton field. The collimated irradiation field of the PTB has a diameter of approximately 40 mm and is generated with the cyclotron beam via the d(E_d = 13. 3 MeV) +Be reaction. A water absorbed dose rate of up to 15 mGy/s at a distance of 585 mm from the neutron source can be achieved. The absolute absorbed dose to water is determined with a calorimeter with an uncertainty of less than 2. 5 %. The <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> is transportable and can be used at the customer's site. A tissue-equivalent ionisation chamber is applied as a secondary standard instrument. The photon dose of the mixed field is determined with a Geiger-Mueller counter. An open-to-air ionisation chamber with an active volume of 0. 125 cm" 3 and made from polymethyl methacrylate is connected to a flexible hose and is operated in a water phantom. It serves as a relative dose transfer device. (orig.)

40|$|At BNM-LNHB, the {{references}} {{in terms of}} absorbed dose to water are based on graphite calorimeter measurements. In the cobalt- 60 beam, measurements were performed directly with the graphite calorimeter in a graphite phantom. Absorbed dose to water in a water phantom was then determined using a transfer method by means of relative measurements made with ionisation chambers and Fricke dosimeters. Our medical linac (Saturne 43 from GE-Medical Systems) is being characterised {{in the same way}} for three photon beam qualities 6 MV, 12 MV and 20 MV. Special attention was given to the vacuum-gaps correction, {{one of the most important}} source of uncertainty. We carried out measurements in a graphite device similar to the calorimeter, using a very small diode embedded in a body corresponding to the calorimeter core. Measurements were made alternatively with and without vacuum gaps in the graphite phantom. The ratio of the results leads directly to the vacuum-gap correction factor. Monte-Carlo calculations were also carried out using both EGS 4 and PENELOPE codes. The results are in good agreement, regarding the uncertainties. At present, a <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> is being realised. The aim is to get an absorbed dose standard independent of and complementing those based on graphite calorimetry. Particular attention will be devoted to the possibilities in terms of uncertainty compared with those attainable using graphite calorimetry...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{increased}} use of proton beams for clinical purposes has enhanced the demand for accurate absolute dosimetry for protons. As calorimetry is the most direct way to establish the absorbed dose and because water has recently been accepted as standard material for this type of beam, the importance of water calorimetry is obvious. In this work we report <b>water</b> <b>calorimeter</b> operation in an 85 -MeV proton beam and a comparison of the absorbed dose to water measured by ionometry with the dose resulting from water calorimetric measurements. To ensure a proper understanding of the heat defect for defined impurities in water for this type of radiation, a relative response study was first done in comparison with theoretical calculations of the heat defect. The results showed that pure hypoxic water and hydrogen-saturated water yielded the same response with practically zero heat defect, in agreement with the model calculations. The absorbed dose inferred from these measurements was then compared with the dose derived from ionometry by applying the European Charged Heavy Particle Dosimetry (ECHED) protocol. Restricting the comparison to chambers recommended in the protocol, the calorimeter dose was found to be 2. 6 % +/- 0. 9 % lower than the average ionometry dose. In order to estimate the significance of chamber-dependent effects in this deviation, measurements were performed using a set of ten ionization chambers of five different types. The maximum internal deviation in the ionometry results amounted to 1. 1 %. We detected no systematic chamber volume dependence, but observed a small but systematic effect of the chamber wall thickness. The observed deviation between calorimetry and ionometry can be attributed to a combination of the value of (W-air/e) (p) for protons, adopted in the ECHED protocol, the mass stopping power ratios of water to air for protons, and possibly small ionization chamber wall effects.

40|$|The J- 2 X and RS- 68 B rocket {{engines are}} being {{developed}} for NASA's Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles. In support {{of the development of}} these engines, hot-fire testing on subscale coaxial injectors has been performed at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to evaluate performance data relative to injector type, liquid oxygen (LOX) post tip design features, element density and various operating conditions. Shear coaxial injectors with element densities of 1. 1, 1. 6, and 2. 3 elements/in 2 and a swirl coaxial injector with element density of 1. 6 elements/in 2 were evaluated at conditions relevant to the Ares applications. Chamber pressures with oxygen/hydrogen propellants ranged from 815 - 1630 psig with mixture ratios ranging from 4. 7 - 6. 9. Fuel manifold inlet temperatures were varied from 90 to 270 R. Shear coaxial LOX post tip thicknesses ranged from 0. 006 in. to 0. 0175 in. Modular, <b>water</b> cooled, <b>calorimeter</b> chamber assemblies were used to provide heating rate data and evaluate the effects of characteristic length (L*). Performance was evaluated relative to the resulting characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency. Testing with both the 2. 3 and 1. 1 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injectors demonstrated no improvement in performance of the "thin" tip configuration versus the "thick" tip configuration. The loss in chamber pressure and associated performance loss seen in previous testing at low fuel temperatures could not be reliably repeated, indicating that this loss is not the result of a fluidic process in the injector elements. Further, no performance loss could be demonstrated once a faceplate seal specifically designed for operation with low temperature hydrogen was implemented in the 1. 1 elements/sq in shear coaxial injector. Results for the 1. 6 elements/sq in swirl injector at cold fuel temperatures showed performance higher than both the 1. 6 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector and the 2. 3 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector...|$|R
25|$|Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah {{hypothesized}} that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy <b>water</b> within a <b>calorimeter,</b> an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium {{was thought to be}} accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, {{particle}} size distribution characteristics and consistency limits {{have been used to}} characterize fine-grained soils. However, these schemes of soil characterization are devoid of several other soil-specific parameters (viz., specific surface area, specific gravity, weight loss during heating, heat produced during the interaction of soil with water, chemical and mineralogical composition, zeta potential, cation-exchange capacity, and reactivity) that imbibe in them physical, chemical, mineralogical, and thermal characteristics or, in short, the "overall characteristics" of the soil. These characteristics are also useful to define soils with pollutants and contaminants, which result from rapid and indiscriminate industrialization. Hence, characterization of the soil based on its "heat of wetting," which imbibes the specific characteristics of the soil and is measured by the percentage increase in temperature (PIT) when soil-water interaction occurs, appears to be quite prudent and a novel idea or hypothesis. With this in view and to develop a soil characterization scheme, soils of completely different characteristics were allowed to interact with <b>water</b> in a <b>calorimeter,</b> and the PIT was measured precisely by employing a thermocouple. The PIT and various soil-specific parameters when correlated with each other yielded well-defined relationships. Utility of these relationships for a quick and easy characterization of fine-grained soils has also been demonstrated in this study...|$|R
