40|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded a {{pilot project}} to assist small and medium-size {{manufacturers}} who want to minimize their generation of waste but who lack the expertise to do so. In an effort to assist these manufacturers Waste Minimization Assessment Centers (WMACs) were established at selected universities and procedures were adapted from the EPA Waste Minimization Opportunity Assessment Manual. The WMAC team at Colorado State University performed an assessment at a plant that manufactures folding paperboard cartons. Paperboard stock is cut to specific sheet sizes, printed using a six-color press, cut into carton patterns, folded, and glued. The assessment team`s report detailing findings and recommendations, indicated that <b>waste</b> <b>paperboard</b> is generated in large quantities, and that the most significant cost savings can be achieved through collection and reuse of step 1 solvent used in the printing system. This Research Brief {{was developed by the}} principal investigators and EPA`s National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH, to announce key findings of an ongoing research project that is fully documented in a separate report of the same title available from University City Science Center...|$|E
40|$|Termites {{provide the}} {{valuable}} service of recycling wood and other cellulose {{materials in the}} natural environment, improving soil physical and chemical properties. Therefore, {{it is important to}} manipulate their behavior by providing more attractive food sources for the termite control system. Biological activity of termites related to the consumption of different food sources also consistently generates various biogenic products. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the attractiveness of food sources from some mixtures of paper, agricultural and industrial wastes and to determine the structure and chemical properties of the biogenic production. For the purpose of the study, various paper <b>wastes</b> (newsprint, <b>paperboard,</b> HVS) were mixed with agricultural and industrial processing wastes (rice husk, biogas, tofu) at different levels. The effectiveness of attractants was evaluated using test arena in the laboratory, whereas the structure and chemical properties of biogenic production were determined after placing the attractant sample test units in the field (underground) for about 6 weeks. The results indicate that the mixtures of the tested food sources are more attractive to subterranean termites compared to the control in terms of the termite aggregation time and number. The biogenic products in the field test also showed better structure and chemical properties (bulk density, aggregate fraction distribution, pH, and C-organic content) compared to the surrounding soil...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Although (flotation) deinking {{has been}} a common {{industry}} practice for several decades, true residual ink content and deinking efficiency have never been quantified. Paper brightness and ERIC (Effective Residual Ink Concentration), based on measurements of the absorption coefficient of deinked pulp, {{have been used to}} determine performance of flotation deinking processes and the quality of deinked pulps. This study demonstrated a newmethod for quantifying true residual ink content of mixed office waste paper by determining the trace iron content in pulp samples. Two sets of laboratory studies were conducted, one using mixed pulp samples of different ink contents and the other using samples from flotation deinking experiments with different surfactant dosages. All pulp samples including flotation feeds and accepts were characterized by ERIC, brightness, and iron-content-derived ink content. The results suggest that ERIC and brightness are less suitable than iron content for evaluating the residual ink in very clean papers. In flotation studies, both ERIC and brightness predict lower deinking efficiencies than are obtained from iron-content measurements. However, brightness is suitable for evaluating the final quality of very clean deinked pulp because of its high accuracy at high brightness levels. Recycling of waste paper is an effective way to conserve forest resources. <b>Waste</b> paper and <b>paperboard</b> recovery was 63. 4 % or approximately 50 million tons in 2009 in the United States...|$|R
