40|$|This paper {{addressed}} assessing {{feasibility of}} hybrid use of ocean renewable energy, such as <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> wind energy around Japanese coast. At first, <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> wind energy theoretical potentials were calculated and, {{in the second}} step, correlation coefficient between <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> wind energy was computed around Japanese coast. Sea area suitable for hybrid use of ocean renewable energy resources {{is supposed to have}} high potential for some types of energy resources. Furthermore, correlation of power generation between <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> wind energy resources should be low because one energy resource needs to complement another one for stabilizing power generation.

This paper presents the coastal <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> current distribution extracted from marine radar image sequences. The spatial current results from radar are verified by in-situ current data measured by GPS drifting buoy. The result shows that the average error of current measurement by radar is around 0. 09 m/s. In addition, {{it is found that}} the properties of coastal <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> current are non-homogeneity.

We examine in detail how {{to determine the}} <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> phase shaping functions with harmonic amplitude data only first, and then after including the harmonic phase data. Three distortion effects units are used to provide test data. <b>Wave</b> <b>and</b> phase shaping functions for the emulation of these effects are derived {{with the assistance of}} a super-resolution frequency-domain analysis technique. In complement to this, we describe an alternative time domain method for determining phase shaping functions using Dynamic Time Warping. Finally, we propose a method for assessing the frequency dependency of distortion effects to help the design of multiband <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> phase shaping functions...|$|R
