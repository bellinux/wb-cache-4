5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> or {{weak base}} that changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} basic, because HF is a <b>weak</b> <b>acid.</b> The low nucleophilicity of fluoride means {{it can be}} a useful base in organic chemistry. CsF gives higher yields in Knoevenagel condensation reactions than KF or NaF.|$|E
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> when dissolved in acetic acid. This is because acetic acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
40|$|Acetic acid {{produces}} an irritating sensation {{that can be}} attributed to activation of nociceptors within the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the nasal or oral cavities. These sensory neurons sense a diverse array of noxious agents in the environment, allowing animals to actively avoid tissue damage. Although receptor mechanisms have been identified for many noxious chemicals, the mechanisms by which animals detect <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> such as acetic acid, are less well understood. <b>Weak</b> <b>acids</b> are only partially dissociated at neutral pH and, as such, some can cross the cell membrane, acidifying the cell cytosol. The nociceptor ion channel TRPA 1 is activated by CO 2, through gating of the channel by intracellular protons, making it a candidate to more generally mediate sensory responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> To test this possibility, we measured responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> from heterologously expressed TRPA 1 channels and trigeminal neurons with patch clamp recording and Ca 2 + microfluorometry. Our results show that heterologously expressed TRPA 1 currents can be induced by a series of <b>weak</b> organic <b>acids,</b> including acetic, propionic, formic, and lactic acid, but not by strong acids. Notably, the degree of channel activation was predicted by the degree of intracellular acidification produced by each acid, suggesting that intracellular protons are the proximate stimulus that gates the channel. Responses to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> produced a Ca 2 +-independent inactivation that precluded further activation by <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> or reactive chemicals, whereas preactivation by reactive electrophiles sensitized TRPA 1 channels to <b>weak</b> <b>acids.</b> Importantly, responses of trigeminal neurons to <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> were highly overrepresented in the subpopulation of TRPA 1 -expressing neurons and were severely reduced in neurons from TRPA 1 knockout mice. We conclude that TRPA 1 is a general sensor for <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> that produce intracellular acidification and suggest that it functions within the pain pathway to mediate sensitivity to cellular acidosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis and}} Mycobacterium smegmatis {{to a range}} of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> and acid pH was investigated. M. tuberculosis was found to be more susceptible to <b>acid</b> pH and <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> than M. smegmatis. The <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> were more active against M. tuberculosis at acid pH than at neutral pH. M. tuberculosis was found to be less able to maintain its internal pH and membrane potential at acid pH than M. smegmatis. The antituberculous activity of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> correlated with their ability to disrupt the membrane potential but not the internal pH. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to M. tuberculosis physiology and development of new antituberculous agents...|$|R
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} the equilibrium constant for this reaction, {{in which the}} ligand loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to hydrolysis, that is, it behaves as a <b>weak</b> <b>acid,</b> so the pK values for the hydrolysis reactions must also be known.|$|E
40|$|The <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> furan derivatives, and {{phenolic}} compounds formed during lignocellulose pretreatment are potential inhibitors of subsequent enzymatic and microbial processes. In this work, {{the effects of}} the steam explosion process on the formation of <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> furan derivatives, and {{phenolic compounds}} were explored. The correlations of different steam explosion conditions and formation kinetics of degradation products showed that the formation of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> and furan derivatives was in the first-order reactions, which are expressed as. The formation of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> and furan derivatives increases with pretreatment temperature and time. On the other hand, the formation of phenolic compounds showed typical characteristics of continuous reaction, expressed as. The formation was affected by the active energies in two stages, temperature and time, and thus existed at extreme value. This work revealed the formation rules of <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds in a steam explosion process and provided theoretical guidelines for improving the process and limiting the production of certain inhibitors...|$|R
25|$|The {{greater the}} value of Ka, the more the {{formation}} of H+ is favored, and the lower the pH of the solution. The Ka of <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> varies between 1.810−16 and 55.5. Acids with a Ka less than 1.810−16 are <b>weaker</b> <b>acids</b> than water.|$|R

5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a <b>weak</b> <b>acid,</b> {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a <b>weak</b> <b>acid,</b> the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{strength}} of an acid is generally discussed {{as a unique}} feature of the acid itself according to its chemical structure. Strong acids have a lower pKa value, and <b>weak</b> <b>acids</b> have a higher one. In the classrooms of high schools and universities, we sometimes use the technical terms “strong acid ” and “weak acid”. However, there are some acids {{for which it is}} very difficult to say, from their pKa values, whether they are strong or weak. This research addresses the distinction between strong <b>acids</b> and <b>weak</b> <b>acids,</b> in a restricted initial concentration of acids, to provide a clear distinction between strong <b>acids</b> and <b>weak</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

25|$|Valproic acid (VPA) is {{an organic}} <b>weak</b> <b>acid.</b> The {{conjugate}} base is valproate. The {{sodium salt of}} the acid is sodium valproate and a coordination complex of the two is known as divalproex sodium.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to other antiepileptic drugs, at present {{there is little}} favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring. Salivary levels of valproic acid correlate poorly with serum levels, partly due to valproate's <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> property (pKa of 4.9).|$|E
25|$|A weakly basic solvent {{has less}} {{tendency}} than a strongly basic one {{to accept a}} proton. Similarly a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> has less tendency to donate protons than a strong acid. As a result, a strong acid such as perchloric acid exhibits more strongly acidic properties than a <b>weak</b> <b>acid</b> such as acetic acid when dissolved in a weakly basic solvent. On the other hand, all acids tend to become indistinguishable in strength when dissolved in strongly basic solvents owing to the greater affinity of strong bases for protons. This is called the leveling effect. Strong bases are leveling solvents for acids, weak bases are differentiating solvents for acids.|$|E
