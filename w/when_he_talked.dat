5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E

25|$|The word satyagraha {{itself was}} coined through a public contest that Gandhi {{sponsored}} through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', {{when he realized}} that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, {{are saying is that}} that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, {{they are able to}} use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E

500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and {{seemed to want to}} make sure that I knew he had never married her. I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics of}} the {{movement}} assail promises made by its leaders, arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible. Televangelists are often criticized for abusing the faith of their listeners by enriching themselves through large donations. Prosperity theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles. For instance, some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the Apostle, who {{is believed to have}} experienced significant suffering during his ministry, are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology. [...] Cathleen Falsani, religion writer in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings [...] "Jesus was born poor, and he died poor. During his earthly tenure, he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about material wealth, it was usually part of a cautionary tale." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith was rumoured to be {{creating}} the theme tune for Enterprise, as although he didn't typically work on television, {{because of his}} affiliation with the Star Trek franchise, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> of creating a new television theme it was presumed {{that it would be}} for this series. The franchise was known for typically using orchestral themes, but Berman said that the theme tune would be more [...] "contemporary" [...] than heard in previous series and a [...] "little hipper". The theme was revealed to be a cover of the Rod Stewart single [...] "Faith of the Heart", by British tenor Russell Watson. Stewart's song had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 film Patch Adams. For the use in Enterprise, it was retitled to [...] "Where My Heart Will Take Me", but prompted a negative reaction from existing Star Trek fans. These included an online petition to have the song removed, and there was a protest held outside of Paramount Studios. Executive producers Braga and Berman both defended the choice, with Berman saying that the fan response was split over the song while Braga said that some people found the song [...] "uplifting". It was remixed for the third season, most notably with a new guitar track and fewer backing vocals.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} begins with Magnus forcing Wexford {{to step down}} {{as head of the}} Sanctuary Network, thereby putting herself back in command, {{while the rest of the}} team deal with the tsunami. Though they are not happy that Big Bertha is still alive, the other Sanctuary house heads decide to keep Magnus in charge, while also firing Wexford for {{breaking}} several protocols. She learns from Will that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to Kali, the avatar manifestation of Big Bertha, into stopping the tsunami, he saw her father, who left her clues leading to a map leading to Hollow Earth, thought to be the home of every abnormal species on the planet. In [...] "Breach" [...] Magnus learns Adam Worth is still alive, and he also intends to find Hollow Earth, having been there before and resurrected. After finding an entrance to Hollow Earth in Tibet, she and the team venture to the underground city of Praxis, where leader Ranna (Polly Walker) executes her and her team for trespassing. However, they are later resurrected as she wants their help in saving the city, which is facing destruction because a hyperspecies abnormal is not controlling the city's geothermal energy. After saving it, Magnus and her team and Ranna part in good terms. It is also revealed Worth also came to the city to steal a power source with unlimited capabilities. Though it was assumed Druitt killed him before he could leave with it, it is later revealed in the season finale that Druitt kept him alive and that he is using the power source to create a time machine and cure his daughter's leukemia, which could cause untold consequences on the planet. [...] His first failed attempt causes the destruction of Praxis, and a time dilation bubble in Carentan, France. Magnus fails to stop him from succeeding, but does follow him through a time portal to London in 1898.|$|E
