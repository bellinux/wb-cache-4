25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sound of gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
25|$|Guðrún {{answered}} {{that she did}} not wish to marry Atli, but her mother responded that with Atli she would be as happy as if both Sigurd and her son Sigmund were still alive. Furthermore, if she did not marry Atli, she would live without husband {{for the rest of her}} life. Guðrún responded that her mother should not be so eager to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} stories {{surrounding}} {{the circumstances of}} his attempted murder. A version by the 19th-century Ottoman historian Ahmed Cevdet Pasha gives the following account: one of his slaves, a Georgian girl named Cevri, gathered ashes <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> commotion in the palace surrounding the murder of Selim III. When the assassins approached the Harem chambers where Mahmud was staying, she was able to keep them away for a while by throwing ashes into their faces, temporarily blinding them. This allowed Mahmud to escape through a window and climb onto the roof of the Harem. He apparently ran to the roof of the Third Court where other pages saw him and helped him come down with pieces of clothes that were quickly tied together as a ladder. By this time {{one of the leaders of}} the rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha arrived with his armed men and upon seeing the dead body of Selim III proclaimed Mahmud as padishah. The slave girl Cevri Kalfa was awarded for her bravery and loyalty and appointed haznedar usta, the chief treasurer of the imperial Harem, which was the second most important position in the hierarchy. A plain stone staircase at the Altınyol (Golden Way) of the Harem is called Staircase of Cevri (Jevri) Kalfa, since the events apparently happened around there and are associated with her.|$|E

25|$|Jeffreys's DNA {{method was}} first {{put to use}} in 1985 {{when he was asked}} to help in a disputed {{immigration}} case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from Ghana. The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to {{the other members of the}} family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> results. DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls. This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. In 1992, Jeffreys' methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele, who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a femur bone of his exhumed skeleton, with DNA from his widow and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went {{out the front door}} and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|McCracken {{was one of}} {{the real-life}} {{counterparts}} of Holly Golightly in Truman Capote's popular novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. While playing in Bloomer Girl in October 1944, she received a War Department telegram telling her of the death of her brother, Buddy [...] McCracken, a month earlier during particularly vicious combat on the Pacific island of Peleliu. She reacted violently <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news, tearing up her dressing room. McCracken told Capote of the incident, and he used it in the novella. In the book, Holly Golightly has a violent outburst in reaction to her brother's death during Army service overseas. Golightly is shown singing songs from Oklahoma!, accompanying herself on a guitar, and owning The Baseball Guide, which was edited by McCracken's uncle James Isaminger.|$|E

Timberlake produced the song, while Morris provided background vocals. McEntire's vocals were recorded by Chris Ashburn and Kevin Mills at Starstruck Studios in Nashville, while Timberlake's were recorded by Jeff Rothschild at Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood. Larry Gold arranged and conducted the strings, which were provided by Alyssa Park, Amy Wickman, Caroline Buckman and the Section Quartet. Rob Ickes performed the dobro, while Glenn Worf performed the upright bass. The song was mixed by Jean-Marie Horvat, with assistance from Colin Miller at Oz Recording Studios in Valencia.|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1997, Bloomsbury {{published}} Philosopher's Stone with {{an initial}} print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between £16,000 and £25,000. Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction {{was held in the}} United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000.

500|$|On 7 January 1558, king Henry II of France sent forces led by Francis, Duke of Guise, who laid siege to Calais. When the French attacked, {{they were}} able to {{surprise}} the English at the critical strongpoint of Fort Nieulay and the sluice gates, which could have flooded the attackers, remained unopened. The loss was regarded by Queen Mary I of England as a dreadful misfortune. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news, she reportedly said, [...] "When I am dead and opened, you shall find 'Philip' [...] and 'Calais' lying in my heart." [...] The region around Calais, then-known as the Calaisis, was renamed the Pays Reconquis ("Reconquered Country") in commemoration of its recovery by the French. Use of the term is reminiscent of the Spanish Reconquista, with which the French were certainly familiar—and, since it occurred {{in the context of a}} war with Spain (Philip II of Spain was at the time Queen Mary's consort), might have been intended as a deliberate snub.|$|E
500|$|Shear's {{original}} version of [...] "All Through the Night" [...] {{is set in}} the key of F major, and proceeds at a tempo of approximately 96 beats per minute. For her cover version, Lauper transposed the key up a minor third to A-flat major, and kept the tempo at the same 96 beats per minute as the original. The song is set in common time. Lauper's voice spans an octave and a fourth between G3 and D♭5. Jules Shear himself makes a guest appearance on Lauper's version, singing a wordless falsetto melody near the end, as well as the lower harmony in the choruses. [...] The chorus was unintentionally altered by Lauper from the Shear version <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> upper harmony vocal and thought it was the lead vocal. [...] Lyrically, [...] "All Through the Night" [...] addresses the same concept of love and its tug at heart-strings as was emphasized by Lauper's previous single, [...] "Time After Time." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an eye on her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's a funky track. Who's that for?' And we said, 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'.

500|$|Walker {{dedicated}} a {{large portion}} of his analysis to Rose. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised her role in the episode as been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's, being inquisitive about several concepts: why Rose was shocked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Doctor had died, but later being knowledgeable about Donna's history and destiny; whether if Rose was travelling between universes or just time-travelling; why Rose herself didn't convince Donna to turn left instead of sending Donna on a suicide mission; why Rose didn't change her clothes between her appearances; and why Rose refused to tell anyone her name. He noted the allusion to the concept of the power of names previously referred to in [...] "The Shakespeare Code", [...] "Last of the Time Lords", and [...] "Silence in the Library", but ultimately theorised that the reason was so Davies could set up the episode's cliffhanger.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now.

In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E
