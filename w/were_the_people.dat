He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that “To me, they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E

Americans and foreigners of many different countries, statuses, classes, and races rushed to California for gold. Almost all (~96%) were young men. Women in the California Gold Rush were few and had many opportunities to do new things and take on new tasks. Argonauts, as they were often called, walked over the California Trail or came by sea. About 80,000 Argonauts arrived in 1849 alone—about 40,000 over the California trail and 40,000 by sea.|$|E

25|$|In the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw {{the most}} human {{development}} {{due to the}} {{fertility of the soil}} and the presence of surface water for agriculture. The oldest group to inhabit the area <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> now known as the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active between 800 BCE and 300 CE. Their largest city is now the site called Chupícuaro, and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, Colima, Nayarit, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the Toltec city of Tula and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline. This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the Guamares left ethnically.|$|E

Born in a San Juan slum, he initially believed the mission to Rakhat was divinely inspired. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people {{with a variety of}} unique skills and talents, had seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo; one of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions. In Sandoz's mind, only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected.

500|$|The {{effects of}} the Gold Rush were substantial. Whole {{indigenous}} societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, called [...] "forty-niners" [...] (referring to 1849). The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America, {{and they were the}} first to start flocking to the state in late 1848. Of the 300,000 people who came to America during the Gold Rush, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail; forty-niners often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and China. Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state {{to meet the needs of}} the settlers. San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852. Roads, churches, schools and other towns were built throughout California. In 1849 a state constitution was written. The new constitution was adopted by referendum vote, and the future state's interim first governor and legislature were chosen. In September, 1850, California became a state.|$|E
