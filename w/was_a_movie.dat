Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well.

25|$|Martin's {{first solo}} film, Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), was a box-office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with {{rock and roll}} to the fore, {{the era of the}} pop crooner was waning. Martin wanted to become a {{dramatic}} actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, The Young Lions (1958), his part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in night clubs, films, and records. Martin replaced Randall and the film {{turned out to be the}} beginning of Martin's comeback. Martin starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, Some Came Running (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> recording, television, and nightclub star. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in Rio Bravo (1959), directed by Howard Hawks and also starring John Wayne and singer Ricky Nelson. He teamed again with Wayne in The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the Judy Holliday stage musical comedy Bells Are Ringing. He won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy Who Was That Lady? but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's Ada, and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, Toys in the Attic, opposite Geraldine Page, as well as in 1970's drama Airport, a huge box-office success.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} {{screenplay}} for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting {{character in the}} vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster. Director Gore Verbinski admitted, [...] "The first film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, {{and he kind of}} affects everybody else." [...] Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate can be a good man, like his father.|$|E

Giler accused new president Norman Levy of being the one that held back the film's production; Levy would later declare that [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> I wanted to make," [...] but he felt another Alien would prove too costly. In the meantime, Giler and partners Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox regarding the disbursement of the Alien profits. By the time the lawsuit was settled in 1983, Fox had new executives that got interested in continuing Alien. Giler pitched the project to one of the executives as a cross between Hill's Southern Comfort and The Magnificent Seven.|$|E

Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E

Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, gave the film a negative review, declaring [...] "never <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> so bleak and empty". He claimed that Never Let Me Go did not [...] "embrace the book's unrelentingly dark tones", but rather wallowed in them. He commented that not even the cast's performance, particularly Garfield's, were enough to redeem the film. New York Times journalist Manohla Dargis said that the film presented [...] "the aspect of a tasteful shocker" [...] because its [...] "cruelty is done so prettily and with such caution that the sting remains light".|$|E

500|$|Initially, Ed Wood was in {{development}} with Columbia, but when Burton {{decided he wanted}} to shoot the film in black-and-white, studio head Mark Canton would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a first look deal. Burton said black-and-white was [...] "right for the material and the movie, and this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> that had to be in black-and-white". He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put Ed Wood into turnaround. The decision sparked interest from Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox in optioning the film rights, but Burton accepted an offer from Walt Disney Studios, who had previously produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. Similar to Nightmare, Disney released Ed Wood under their Touchstone Pictures banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on Ed Wood. Principal photography began in August 1993, and lasted 72 days. Despite his previous six-film relationship with Danny Elfman, Burton chose Howard Shore to write the film score. Under the pressure of finishing the score for Batman Returns, Burton's relationship with Elfman became strained and Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced [...] "creative differences" [...] during The Nightmare Before Christmas.|$|E

By March 2012, Marvel whittled down the possible directors for the sequel to three candidates: George Nolfi, F. Gary Gray, and brothers Anthony and Joseph Russo. Walt Disney Studios announced the planned release of the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger on April 4, 2014. Disney stated, [...] "The second installment will pick-up where ... The Avengers leaves off, as Steve Rogers continues his affiliation with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world." [...] Markus later elaborated, [...] "I think S.H.I.E.L.D. is the water [...] swimming in. It's definitely a Captain America movie.

500|$|The {{original}} Friday the 13th {{was produced}} {{and directed by}} Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on The Last House on the Left (1972). Cunningham, inspired {{by the success of}} John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), wanted Friday the 13th to be shocking, visually stunning, and [...] " [...] you jump out of your seat". Distancing himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 13th {{to be more of a}} [...] "roller coaster ride". The first film was meant to be [...] "a real scary movie", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for Friday the 13th began as nothing more than a title. A Long Night at Camp Blood was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his [...] "Friday the 13th" [...] moniker and rushed to place an advertisement in International Variety. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the Friday the 13th logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were [...] "no problems" [...] with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> before ours called Friday the 13th: The Orphan.
