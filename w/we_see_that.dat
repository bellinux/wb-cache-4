5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in the control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

50|$|For the Inverse <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Proximate is {{reflected}} inversely through the Object {{and then through}} the Patient, then <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Obviative {{is reflected}} through the Subject and then through the Agent.|$|R
3000|$|<b>We</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the global}} {{baseband}} estimator almost achieves asymptotically the baseband CRLB. <b>We</b> can also <b>see</b> <b>that</b> both the MLE {{and the global}} passband estimator achieve asymptotically the passband CRLB. However, [...]...|$|R
25|$|Examining the {{relevant}} diagram <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> such production creates a social cost curve {{that is less}} than that of the private curve. In an equilibrium state <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> markets creating positive externalities of production will under produce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed.|$|E
25|$|Such {{externalities}} are {{a result}} of firms externalising their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalising such costs <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this case, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> an increased cost of production on society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a pure {{ensemble}} {{becomes a}} mixed ensemble after measurement. Measurement, as described above, {{is a special}} case of quantum operations.|$|E

30|$|Obviously, from Lemma  2.1, <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> (3.4) holds.|$|R
25|$|Thus, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{a complex}} phase {{gives rise to}} {{processes}} that proceed at different rates for particles and antiparticles, and CP is violated.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the only}} residue (mod 3) is 1, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> −3 is a {{quadratic}} residue modulo every prime {{which is a}} residue modulo 3.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> (3.4) {{does not}} imply (3.5) in general.|$|R
30|$|From Remark  1 <b>we</b> {{immediately}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the following}} is true.|$|R
25|$|From these equations, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the {{electric}} potential is constant in any region for which {{the electric}} field vanishes (such as occurs inside a conducting object).|$|E
25|$|From this <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Möbius {{group is}} a 3-dimensional complex Lie group (or a 6-dimensional real Lie group). It is a semisimple non-compact Lie group.|$|E

30|$|From Fig.  12, <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a {{topology}} designed {{using the}} combination method performs {{better than a}} topology designed using an integer linear programming (ILP) model with the equal degree and node connection constraints. From Fig.  13, <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the combination method is slightly better than the hypercube when k is large.|$|R
30|$|Clearly, <b>we</b> can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> _n→+∞f^[n](s)= f(s), (f^[n])_ 0 =n and (f^[n])_∞=f_∞.|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the rest}} energy is an {{independent}} invariant. A rest energy can be calculated even for particles and systems in motion, by translating to a frame in which momentum is zero.|$|E
25|$|In an {{equilibrium}} state <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good. As a result, the socially optimal production level would {{be lower than}} that observed.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} a {{bijection}} between symmetric extensions of an operator and isometric extensions of its Cayley transform. The symmetric extension is self-adjoint {{if and only if}} the corresponding isometric extension is unitary.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was before}} this that father {{returned}} one afternoon. Ernest was with me, and <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> father was angry--philosophically angry. He was rarely really angry; but a certain measure of controlled anger he allowed himself. He called it a tonic. And <b>we</b> could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was tonic-angry {{when he entered the}} room.|$|R

25|$|From the {{analysis}} of the case with unknown variance but known mean, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the update equations involve sufficient statistics over the data consisting of the number of data points and sum of squared deviations.|$|E

25|$|Thus (after having grouped {{the terms}} with the same exponent) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the set of the}} exponents form a {{complete}} set of conjugates and, if two terms have conjugate exponents, they are multiplied by the same coefficient.|$|E
