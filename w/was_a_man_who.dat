5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while the north tower was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Power and {{communications}} across Rodrigues {{and the island}} of Mauritius were crippled by the storm, with {{the entirety of the}} former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses {{as a result of the}} storm. Approximately 15 metric tons of flour and 20 metric tons of rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million. Property damage from the storm amounted to US$50 million, and there were four deaths on the island; three were caused by traffic accidents, and the other <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> died while making storm preparations.|$|E

25|$|The East Indiaman Phoenix {{captured}} Malartic on 10 November 1800 in the Bay of Bengal at , {{which is}} about 200km SSW of Cox's Bazaar. Phoenix was prepared to resist a more formidable opponent. She had her guns double-shotted, and the troops that she was transporting stayed concealed on the poop until Malartic approached to board. At that point Phoenix fired a broadside into Malartic, and the troops revealed themselves. Dutertre immediately struck. The only casualty on Phoenix <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> suffered a broken leg from the recoil of a carronade. Captain William Moffat reported that Malartic had lost two surgeons, the boatswain, and several crew members killed in the action with Rebecca; Moffat did not report any casualties on Malartic from her encounter with Phoenix.|$|E

25|$|According to the narrative, Nimrod became {{extremely}} arrogant due to {{his wealth}} and power, {{to the point that}} he made the claim that he possessed the power of creation. Claiming divinity for himself, Nimrod quarreled with Ibrahim, but the Qur'an describes that he only deepened in confusion. According to Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Nimrod <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> set his will against that of God. Nimrod proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects. Nimrod's consort Semiramis was also worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also Ninus.) Before Abraham was born, a portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to idolatry. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{introduced}} as a supporting {{character in the}} first game, he {{has been one of}} the primary antagonists throughout the series, where he usually manipulates story events behind-the-scenes. Power-hungry, knowledgeable and infinitely cunning, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> sought to replace the entire human race through mass extinction and forced evolution, believing humanity to be an evolutionary dead-end. To this end, he was affiliated with the Umbrella Corporation as one of its most promising researchers, and at the same time participated in illicit activities by going undercover as S.T.A.R.S. captain in Raccoon City. Through the course of much betrayal of his allies to further his own plans, Wesker fakes his death, gains superhuman strength, speed & regeneration from an experimental variant of the Progenitor virus, and works alongside both Umbrella's mysterious rival company and their successors in the field of biological weapons development, TRICELL, until his ultimate defeat in Resident Evil 5.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} last people to see Paula alive <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
25|$|Charles II <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> prided {{himself on}} his wit and his worldliness. He was well known as a philanderer as well. Highly witty, playful, and sexually wise poetry thus had court sanction. Charles and his brother James, the Duke of York and future King of England, also {{sponsored}} mathematics and natural philosophy, and so spirited scepticism and investigation into nature were favoured by the court. Charles II sponsored the Royal Society, which courtiers were eager to join (for example, the noted diarist Samuel Pepys was a member), just as Royal Society members moved in court. Charles and his court had also learned the lessons of exile. Charles was High Church (and secretly vowed to convert to Roman Catholicism on his death) and James was crypto-Catholic, but royal policy was generally tolerant of religious and political dissenters. While Charles II did have {{his own version of}} the Test Act, he was slow to jail or persecute Puritans, preferring merely to keep them from public office (and therefore to try to rob them of their Parliamentary positions). As a consequence, the prose literature of dissent, political theory, and economics increased in Charles II's reign.|$|E
25|$|By 1923, during Prohibition, Long Hill was {{attracting}} more {{guests for}} its supply of home-brewed ciders and beers than its sporting facilities. While in 1924, through their mutual acquaintance of Ring Lardner, F. Scott Fitzgerald {{turned up at}} the farm and sparred three rounds with Welsh. In 1924, Welsh was back in court, after {{he was involved in}} a car collision caused by him driving his vehicle {{on the wrong side of}} the road. Welsh began looking for other ventures to take him away from the health farm, and in 1925 he rejoined the US Army, becoming a boxing instructor at the Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. While in the forces he placed an advertisement for a manager to run Long Hill, which was accepted by neighbour and friend, Sidky Bey, and his wife Hranoush, known as Madame Bey. With strict curfew hours and a no-alcohol policy, Madame Bey made the farm a success, and Long Hill became an important training venue for New York boxers. But her tenure at the farm ended acrimoniously, over an argument with boxer Battling Siki, who Welsh believed to be a bad influence. After discussing the matter with other boxers, Madame Bey left Long Hill and set up her own rival venue. With Welsh in the Army and Madame Bey gone, the farm fell into disrepair. Bey later recalled Welsh fondly, stating that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> enjoyed having a good time, but was a terrible businessman.|$|E
