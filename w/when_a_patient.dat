5|$|The {{majority}} of discharges from hospice {{are due to}} the death of the patient, although hospice treatment may not end then as care also provides for a period of bereavement counseling for the family afterward. However, there are several other scenarios <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> may be discharged from hospice.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are {{bands of}} {{immunoglobulins}} that are seen <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> blood serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is analyzed.|$|R
50|$|Information {{continuity}} {{in the information}} technology sense may exist alongside physical care continuity, such as <b>when</b> <b>a</b> medical chart arrives with <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> to the hospital. Information continuity may also be separate, such as <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> electronic records are sent to a treating physician before the <b>patient</b> arrives at <b>a</b> care site.|$|R
25|$|Chinese patent {{medicines}} {{are easy}} and convenient. They {{are not easy}} to customize on a patient-by-patient basis, however. They are often used <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> condition is not severe and the medicine can be taken as a long-term treatment.|$|R
5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to have been abandoned in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient,</b> Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>an</b> {{unconscious}} <b>patient</b> enters <b>a</b> hospital, {{the hospital}} utilizes {{a series of}} diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. According to Young, the following steps should be taken <b>when</b> dealing with <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> possibly in <b>a</b> coma: ...|$|R
50|$|Bob Horst {{developed}} the technology behind the Bionic Leg, which contains sensors and robotics that detect and provide force <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> weight shifts. The Bionic Leg is a battery-operated external brace that uses information from foot sensors {{to predict the}} user’s movements while the user walks, sits, and stands.|$|R
30|$|For {{the first}} time, we {{describe}} the successful treatment of <b>an</b> adult <b>patient</b> presenting with empyema, accompanied by serious conditions of acute respiratory failure and septic shock induced by aspiration of a soft-shelled turtle bone. Clinicians should consider the possibility of non-iatrogenic foreign body-induced empyema with acute onset of respiratory failure, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient’s</b> symptoms cannot be attributed to an alternative obvious cause.|$|R
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> {{unexpectedly}} dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He {{confesses to}} Penny that he cheated {{in medical school}} by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while {{she was forced to}} repeat a year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he must confess to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a letter of resignation, but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a letter of resignation, which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had more potential than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start.|$|E
25|$|Since {{risperidone}} {{can cause}} hypotension, its use should be monitored closely <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is also taking anti-hypertensive medicines to avoid severe low blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Current regimens for {{treatment}} of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves' disease), <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.|$|E

25|$|Anticoagulation bridge: Temporary anticoagulation, such as with heparin, is {{used during}} <b>a</b> {{perioperative}} period <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> regular anticoagulant therapy, such as with warfarin, is suspended; {{the goal is}} to prevent excess risk of severe bleeding during or after surgery. The heparin bridge provides some anticoagulant effect (to prevent thrombosis from warfarin withdrawal) {{but not as much as}} would make severe bleeding likely.|$|R
50|$|Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc, {{also called}} Choreoacanthocytosis), {{is a rare}} {{hereditary}} disease caused by a mutation of the gene that directs structural proteins in red blood cells. It belongs {{to a group of}} four diseases characterized under the name Neuroacanthocytosis. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> blood is viewed under a microscope, some of the red blood cells appear thorny. These thorny cells are called acanthocytes.|$|R
25|$|Writer's cramp and musician’s cramp is a task-specific dystonia, {{meaning that}} it only occurs when {{performing}} certain tasks. Writer’s cramp is a contraction of hand and/or arm muscles that happens only <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is writing. It does not occur in other situations, such as <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is typing or eating. Musician’s cramp occurs only when a musician plays an instrument, {{and the type of}} cramp experienced is specific to the instrument. For example, pianists may experience cramping of their hands when playing, while brass players may have cramping or contractions of their mouth muscles.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} complication called twiddler's syndrome occurs <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> manipulates the pacemaker {{and causes}} the leads {{to be removed}} from their intended location and causes possible stimulation of other nerves.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} infusion {{is primarily}} used to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This is {{as opposed to}} intermittent infusion, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> requires medications only at certain times, such as secondary IV and IV push.|$|E
50|$|Rotationplasty, more {{commonly}} known as Van-Nes or Borggreve Rotation, is a limb-sparing medical procedure performed <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> leg is amputated at the knee. The ankle joint is then rotated 180 degrees and {{is attached to the}} former knee joint, becoming a new knee joint. This allows patients to have two fully functional feet, as opposed to losing one leg completely to amputation.|$|R
5000|$|Anticoagulation bridge: Temporary anticoagulation, such as with heparin, is {{used during}} <b>a</b> {{perioperative}} period <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> regular anticoagulant therapy, such as with warfarin, is suspended; {{the goal is}} to prevent excess risk of severe bleeding during or after surgery. The heparin bridge provides some anticoagulant effect (to prevent thrombosis from warfarin withdrawal) {{but not as much as}} would make severe bleeding likely.|$|R
50|$|Micrographia may worsen <b>when</b> <b>a</b> PD <b>patient</b> is under-medicated or {{when the}} effects of the {{medication}} are wearing off.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes the {{arterial}} pressure drops significantly <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> stands up from sitting. This {{is known as}} orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension); gravity reduces the rate of blood return from the body veins below the heart back to the heart, thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac output.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for the {{important}} role antithrombin plays in regulating normal blood coagulation is demonstrated by the correlation between inherited or acquired antithrombin deficiencies and {{an increased risk of}} any affected individual developing thrombotic disease. Antithrombin deficiency generally comes to light <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{bypass surgery}} was {{developed}} in the 1960s in Switzerland by Gazi Yasargil, M.D. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> has an aneurysm involving a blood vessel or a tumor {{at the base of the}} skull wrapping around a blood vessel, surgeons eliminate the problem vessel by replacing it with an artery from another part of the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{directional}} prefixes {{are combined}} with -tropia and -phoria to describe {{various types of}} strabismus. For example, a constant left hypertropia exists <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> left eye is always aimed higher than the right. <b>A</b> <b>patient</b> with <b>an</b> intermittent right esotropia has a right eye that occasionally drifts toward the patient's nose, but at other times is able to align with {{the gaze of the}} left eye. <b>A</b> <b>patient</b> with <b>a</b> mild exophoria can maintain fusion during normal circumstances, but when the system is disrupted, the relaxed posture of the eyes is slightly divergent.|$|R
30|$|However, <b>when</b> {{approaching}} <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with MOA in ACL-deficient knees, {{the main}} features {{to take into account}} are patient’s biological age, functional demands and primary symptom.|$|R
50|$|Heparin {{is used in}} bridge therapy <b>when</b> {{initiating}} <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> on warfarin <b>when</b> in <b>a</b> hospital setting. It {{can be used in}} DVT prophylaxis and treatment, acute coronary syndromes, and ST-segment elevated MI.|$|R
25|$|Some {{emergency}} {{departments in}} smaller hospitals are located near a helipad {{which is used}} by helicopters to transport a patient to a trauma centre. This inter-hospital transfer is often done <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> requires advanced medical care unavailable at the local facility. In such cases the emergency department can only stabilize the patient for transport.|$|E
25|$|A shear is a {{separation}} of the skin from underlying tissues. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward {{the foot of the}} bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> is hospitalized, daily updates are {{entered into}} the medical record documenting {{clinical}} changes, new information, etc. These often {{take the form of}} a SOAP note and are entered by all members of the health-care team (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapists, etc.). They are kept in chronological order and document the sequence of events leading to the current state of health.|$|E
50|$|A person's {{hemoglobin}} {{is important}} in the physician's consideration of iron reduction therapy. A physician can provide therapeutic phlebotomy if the patient's hemoglobin level is sufficient to sustain blood removal. The physician can also recommend the patient to routinely donate blood. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> hemoglobin is not sufficient for phlebotomy. Iron reduction will likely require the removal of iron using specific drugs (iron-chelation). The physician may use a combination of these therapies in some situations.|$|R
40|$|Recognising <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient's</b> {{condition}} is deteriorating {{is a key}} aspect of patient safety {{and the use of}} early warning scoring systems is integral to this. Compliance with such systems can often be poor. Through the introduction of a competency framework and audit system, the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust has demonstrated improvements in compliance with a modified early warning scoring tool, which has had significant benefits in terms of patient safety...|$|R
