25|$|Bombardier TRAXX is a {{modular product}} {{platform}} of electric and Diesel-electric mainline locomotives built by Bombardier Transportation, built in both {{freight and passenger}} variants. The first version was a dual voltage AC locomotive built from 2000 for German railways; later versions include DC versions, as well as quadruple voltage machines, able to operate on most European electrification schemes: 1.5/3.0 kV DC and 15/25 kV AC. The family was expanded to include diesel powered versions in 2006. Elements common to all variants include the steel bodyshells, the two bogies with two powered axles each, the three-phase asynchronous induction motors, the cooling exhausts on the roof edges, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> brakes.|$|E

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics approach {{is used to}} determinate crack behaviour in a railway wheel which is working under different operating conditions with consideration {{of different types of}} railway <b>wheel</b> <b>discs.</b> Reliability of the railway wheel is related to a material failure. This paper is focused on failure of the material which is connected with violation consistency of the wheel material. The fracture mechanic approach is applied with consideration of influence of mechanical compliance. The topology optimization is used to define the shape of one disc type. Obtained results show fracture behaviour and the mechanical compliance of used railway <b>wheel</b> <b>discs.</b> From these results, comparison of separated railway <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> is obtained...|$|R

50|$|Transmission {{of power}} to the rear wheels was {{achieved}} using a four speed manual stick-shift gear-box. There was no synchromesh.

2500|$|It was {{available}} with a 1.0-liter three-cylinder {{with a power}} output of , a 1.3-liter four-cylinder, and later a 1.6-liter four-cylinder (for the sedan only). The higher powered Cultus/Swift GTi had an improved G13B engine which featured hollow camshafts, stronger web casting on the engine block, a better flowing intake manifold (the prior generation intake manifold had its shape compromised {{to fit into the}} engine bay), and its ECU now had electronic control over ignition timing.

5000|$|Both post war and pre war Austin 8s export {{models were}} manufactured. The Austin 8s were {{available}} for the European market as LHD. All other details of the cars were un-changed. The pre war export models for the US market were delivered LHD as well. At {{least some of the}} US export models were provided with the closed pressed wheels instead of the pressed spoke wheels used for the cars for the home market. The pressed wheels were of the same model as fitted on the Austin 8AP tourer models and had the same <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> as the military ones, although the civilian US <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> were chrome plated.|$|R
5000|$|Zipp sells spoked <b>wheels,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{and other}} {{products}} (including stems, seat posts, handlebars, handlebar tape, tires, tubes, and bags) through an international list of authorized dealers. In the early 90's, Zipp built and sold the Zipp 2001, a radical [...] "beam" [...] bike, which has subsequently been discontinued. Zipp also produced mountain bike wheels at its inception, but dropped the program later {{in favor of a}} more specialized road line.|$|R
50|$|Tucker envisioned {{several other}} {{innovations}} that were later abandoned. Magnesium <b>wheels,</b> <b>disc</b> brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing tubeless tires, and a direct-drive torque converter transmission were all evaluated or tested, but were {{dropped on the}} final prototype due to cost, engineering complexity, and lack of time to develop.|$|R

50|$|Special {{steering}} rack, and suspension tuning with a self-leveling rear {{air suspension}} yielded handling performance comparable to European vehicles. Four <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> brakes improved stopping as did standard Goodyear Eagle GT tires, size 195/70R14 (large for the time).|$|E

5000|$|Although superficially {{visually}} {{similar to}} the BFB wheel, the true Boxpok design is, as indicated by its name, derived from [...] "box spoke". This is a spoked wheel, with square box-section hollow spokes. The <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> in section is either two skin thicknesses at the spokes, or zero (i.e. open space) between them.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} as well, though in outdoor {{settings}} these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology {{have given rise to}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.|$|R
5000|$|Believed to be {{the first}} [...] "slingshot" [...] dragster, the Panorama City Special (designed by hot rodder Mickey Thompson) had a full body, {{including}} skirted rear wheels, and a cockpit windshield wrapping around and over the driver. The steel front wheels were covered by lakester-style <b>wheel</b> <b>discs</b> (Moon discs). [...] The car debuted in 1955, at the first NHRA Nationals at Great Bend, Kansas. The wheelbase was only 97 in.|$|R

50|$|The Fiat Dino coupe used an all-steel unibody construction. The Spider had an {{aluminum}} trunk lid. The dual-circuit braking system with vacuum servo operated on four <b>wheel</b> <b>disc</b> brakes.

50|$|Regarding d: For a {{symmetric}} wheel {{such as a}} front <b>wheel</b> with no <b>disc</b> brake, this is {{half the}} distance between the flanges.

50|$|The short-coupled coaches {{could only}} be {{separated}} in the workshop. To couple the locomotive and coaches Scharfenberg couplers were fitted {{that at the same}} time served to couple the brake air pipes. The trailer cars had rounded ends and sloping roofs. The bogies were of the Görlitz III type, the wheelsets ran on roller bearings. Instead of the usual brake blocks the coaches were given disc brakes, that acted directly on the <b>wheel</b> <b>discs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Fiesta ST/XR4 was the {{performance}} model of this Fiesta. It includes a 2.0 L Duratec petrol engine rated at [...] in standard form, {{with a top}} speed of 129 mph.
