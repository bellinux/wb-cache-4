40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the role of {{insurance}} coverage in explaining the generic competition paradox in a two-stage game involving a single producer of brand-name drugs and n quantity-competing producers of generic drugs. Independently of brand loyalty, which some studies rely upon to explain the paradox, we show that heterogene- ity in insurance coverage may result in higher prices of brand-name drugs following generic entry. With market segmentation based on insurance coverage present in both the pre- and post-entry stages, the paradox can arise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> types <b>of</b> drugs are highly substitutable and the market is quite pro?table but {{does not have to}} arise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> types <b>of</b> drugs are highly di¤erentiated. However, with market segmentation occuring only after generic entry, the paradox can arise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> types <b>of</b> drugs are weakly substituables, provided, however, that the industry is not very pro?table. In both cases, that is, when market segmentation is present in the pre-entry stage and when it is not, the paradox becomes more likely to arise as the market expands and/or insurance companies decrease deductables applied on the purchase of generic drugs. brand-name pricing; generic entry; generic competition paradox; health insurance; health economics. ...|$|R

On his way home, Jimmy meets two members of Cadmus, who offer their assistance, take him back to their HQ, and run tests on him. Jimmy's powers go haywire, and he runs off to keep himself from hurting anyone. He encounters the Newsboy Legion, who offer him shelter. Jimmy encounters Forager, who asks for help in stopping {{the killing of the}} New Gods. On Apokolips, Jimmy and Forager fight Parademons and are overpowered and taken prisoner.

Unable to discern the nature of Jimmy's powers with his Mother Box, Mister Miracle gambles by dropping Olsen into a fire pit. Jimmy survives by assuming a turtle-like form.
