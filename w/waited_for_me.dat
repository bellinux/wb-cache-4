I read, shuddered, and knew." [...] He was widely {{described}} {{as the leader of}} an [...] "Auden group" [...] that comprised his friends Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named [...] "Macspaunday." [...] Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as [...] "Spain" [...] gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work [...] "liberal, democratic, and humane", and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a [...] "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact [...] "confined to bourgeois experience." ...|$|E
