5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for it by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of}} the self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} {{eliminate}} many conventional weapons, {{and defend the}} Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that unless this occurred, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve. In 1955, Khrushchev abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack. In January 1960, Khrushchev took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third {{in the size of}} Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the lost troops. While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} held {{a meeting}} on December 10 at 9am in the Saint George's School and Gërmenji held {{a speech to the}} gathered men and after the meeting led the commission to the prefecture. In the prefecture they met with Colonel Descoins and with the other French officers. Haki Shemshedini approached to Colonel Descoins on behalf of the commission. Colonel Descoins informed the commission that they should sign a protocol. On December 10, 1916 Colonel Descoins and the commission signed a protocol, according to which an autonomous province would be established on the territories of Korçë, Bilishti, Kolonja, Opar and Gora. It was also agreed that the 14 members of the commission <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the administrative council, responsible for maintaining order.|$|E

5|$|In most {{fusion energy}} designs, fusion {{neutrons}} react {{with a blanket}} of lithium to breed new tritium for fuel. A major issue with the fission–fusion design is that the neutrons causing fission are no longer available for tritium breeding. While the fission reactions release additional neutrons, these {{do not have enough}} energy to complete the breeding reaction with Li-7, which makes up more than 92% of natural lithium. These lower energy neutrons will cause breeding in Li-6, which could be concentrated from the natural lithium ore. However, the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium per neutron captured, and more than one T per neutron is needed to make up for natural decay and other losses. Using Li-6, neutrons from the fission <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the losses, but only at the cost of removing them from causing other fission reactions, lowering the reactor power output. The designer has to choose which is more important; burning up the fuel through fusion neutrons, or providing power through self-induced fission events.|$|E
5|$|The {{border between}} the Reich and Yugoslavia was {{unsuitable}} for motorised operations. Due to the short notice of the invasion, {{the elements of the}} invading German 2nd Army that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany, German-occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic, and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas in time for 6 April. In the area of responsibility of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski, the XLIX Mountain Corps was significantly delayed, and did not start pushing forward until 8 April. On the following day, the Germans advanced on Celje. In response to withdrawals on the right flank of the 7th Army, 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river on 9 April. Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks railway tunnel near Jesenice, and the Italians made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski.|$|E

In the interim, the Germans formed a special force under the code name Feuerzauber (Magic Fire). This force was initially intended to merely reinforce the 538th Frontier Guard Division, who were manning the border. On the evening of 5 April, one of the aggressive Feuerzauber detachment commanders, Hauptmann Palten, led his Kampfgruppe Palten across the Mura from Spielfeld and, having secured the bridge, began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground, and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system. Due to a lack of Yugoslav counter-attacks, many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 {{installment}} of the TNA World X Cup Tournament was announced in February 2008 by TNA Management Director Jim Cornette. Cornette did not reveal when the tournament would be held or who would be involved. On the May1 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that the tournament was planned for the summer. In mid-May, {{it was reported that}} New Japan Pro Wrestling was sending Milano Collection A.T. and Taichi Ishikari to be featured in the tournament. TNA was also interested in bringing in British wrestler Doug Williams. Averno, Rey Bucanero, Último Guerrero, Volador Jr., Naruki Doi, and Masato Yoshino were revealed at the end of May to be involved. In June, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that Daivari, Tyson Dux, Williams, and Alex Koslov <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> Team International, while Averno, Bucanero, Guerrero, and Volador Jr. would be Team Mexico, and Team Japan would consist of Milano Collection AT, Ishikari, Doi, and Yoshino. The finals of the tournament were also planned to be held at TNA's Victory Road pay-per-view (PPV) event on July13. It was announced on the June19 episode of Impact! that the finals would be contested in an Ultimate X match. Team Mexico had trouble entering the United States, resulting in the tournament starting without them and the team appearing late in the festivities. Team TNA was revealed on the June12 episode of Impact!, with Kaz as the team captain and Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, and Curry Man rounding out the team. Despite the report by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Ishikari did not compete in the tournament; instead, Puma filled out Team Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Later Zhou was {{the last}} of the Five Dynasties that had {{controlled}} northern China {{after the fall of the}} Tang dynasty in 907. Zhao Kuangyin, later known as Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976), usurped the throne and deposed the last Zhou ruler Guo Zongxun with the support of military commanders in 960, initiating the Song dynasty. Upon taking the throne, his first goal was the reunification of China after half a century of political division. This included the conquests of Nanping, Wu-Yue, Southern Han, Later Shu, and Southern Tang in the south as well as the Northern Han and the Sixteen Prefectures in the north. With capable military officers such as Yang Ye (d. 986), Liu Tingrang (929–987), Cao Bin (931–999) and Huyan Zan (d. 1000), the early Song military became the dominant force in China. Innovative military tactics, such as defending supply lines across floating pontoon bridges led to success in battle such as the Song assault against the Southern Tang state while crossing the Yangzi River in 974. Using a mass of arrow fire from crossbowmen, Song forces were able to defeat the renowned war elephant corps of the Southern Han on January 23, 971, thus forcing the submission of Southern Han and terminating the first and last elephant corps that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a regular division within a Chinese army.|$|E

25|$|Cavour {{agreed with}} Napoleon to cede Savoy and Nice to France, {{in order to}} annex Tuscany and Emilia to Piedmont.
