5|$|Australian philosopher Douglas Gasking (1911–1994) {{developed}} {{a version of}} the ontological argument meant to prove God's non-existence. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to be serious; rather, its purpose was to illustrate the problems Gasking saw in the ontological argument.|$|E
5|$|Halo <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> {{to be the}} Xbox's {{flagship}} game due {{to internal}} concerns and gaming press criticism, but Microsoft VP of game publishing Ed Fries did not act on these concerns. The Xbox's marketing heavily featured Halo, whose green color palette meshed with the console's design scheme.|$|E

5|$|After the Festival, the Nimrod was showcased {{for three}} weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show, where it also drew crowds, {{including}} the West Germany economics minister Ludwig Erhard. Afterwards, however, as it had served its purpose the Nimrod was dismantled. As the Nimrod <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> as an entertainment product, it was not followed up by any future games, and Ferranti continued its work on designing general purpose computers.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E

5|$|On 31 July 2008, it was {{announced}} The Tales of Beedle the Bard would also be made available for the public, in both standard and collector's editions. The book was published by Children's High Level Group and printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Amazon.com. The decision was taken due to disappointment among Harry Potter fans after it had initially been announced a wide public release <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended.</b>|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Vaughan Williams, {{who wrote}} in 1928 an {{arrangement}} of the traditional tune associated with the psalm, Old 100th ("All people that on earth do dwell"), arranged it for congregation, organ and orchestra for the coronation of Elizabeth II, becoming ubiquitous at festive occasions in the Anglophone world. Reger's setting, however, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> for church use, but first for a secular occasion, then for the concert hall.|$|E

5|$|The album's artwork, {{featuring}} a plastic skull with tinfoil, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> {{to be the}} original artwork. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.|$|E
5|$|The {{emphasis}} on liberal {{arts in the}} revised degree titles (for both the A.L.B. and A.L.M. degrees) <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to signify {{a difference in the}} degree itself versus the University's other offerings, but instead to serve as a response to concerns expressed by some that programs catering to non-traditional students were overly vocational in nature. The purpose of the name was to reaffirm adherence to the University's historic focus on the liberal arts, and distinguish it from other, more vocational, institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to represent any particular soldier, there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall.|$|E

5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> {{to have any}} {{stations}} of its own, but in 1904 {{it was decided to}} build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> {{to be associated}} with the Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to be racist in any way, and he {{was only trying to}} tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>intended</b> to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
