5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|On June15, a {{tropical}} wave with associated instability {{was observed in}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June16, {{and the next day}} developed a weak circulation {{at the same time that}} Tropical Storm Beulah <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming {{a tropical}} depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the tracks, most passengers travelling {{to and from the}} station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Sooners {{competed with}} a {{relatively}} young team. Oklahoma listed 72players on the roster and only nine of them were scholarship seniors. Following the dismissal of quarterback Rhett Bomar, fifth-year senior Paul Thompson reconverted back to his former role of quarterback after spending 2005 as a wide receiver. Junior college transfer Joey Halzle was slotted as his backup. Thompson had several wide receivers to look to in 2006, including Malcolm Kelly, Manuel Johnson, and Juaquin Iglesias. Not to mention junior Adrian Peterson, the team's main running back. Most of the Sooners' experience <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the ball. The Sooner linebackers were the most experienced players on the team. The squad was anchored by Rufus Alexander and Zach Latimer. Alexander was ranked as the third best linebacker {{in the country at}} the beginning of the season by College Football News. Behind them were other key players such as Demarrio Pleasant and Lewis Baker. Sophomore Ryan Reynolds, a notable player coming out of high school, was injured in the preseason and therefore was unable to contribute in 2006. In addition to a veteran linebacker squad, Oklahoma had a number of big-name defensive ends. During the preseason, College Football News ranked Larry Birdine, Calvin Thibodeaux and C.J. Ah You in the top 25 best defensive ends for the 2006 season (ranked 14th, 20th, and 22nd, respectively). Oklahoma was the only team with three players in the top 25.|$|E

25|$|Following the Louisiana Purchase {{the need}} for {{additional}} roads to the West were recognized by Thomas Jefferson, who authorized the construction of the Cumberland Road in 1806. The Cumberland Road was to connect Cumberland Maryland on the Potomac River with the Wheeling (West) Virginia on the Ohio River, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the Alleghany Mountains.

25|$|Increasingly the air {{supremacy}} won in May and June {{was used to}} the full with British squadrons flying straight at enemy formations whenever they were sighted while the opposition often fought only if escape seemed impracticable. The close scouting of the Australian pilots which had become a daily duty <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> utterly impossible for these German airmen who often flew so high that it is likely their reconnaissances lacked detail; owing to the heat haze over the Jordan Valley, Australian airmen found reconnaissance even at 10,000 feet difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} terminal of {{the line}} was the Troy station at Monmouth, {{on the line from}} Little Mill Junction, near Pontypool to Ross-on-Wye. The line left the station in an easterly direction, and immediately crossed the River Wye and adjacent low-lying ground by a viaduct. Wyesham Junction followed, where the Coleford Railway diverged. Following the east bank of the Wye, the railway reached Redbrook station, crossing then to the west bank by Redbrook Viaduct, 101 yards. There was a halt at Whitebrook, and the next station was Bigsweir, adjacent to a road bridge over the Wye, but with little population nearby. The station name was later changed to St Briavels. Next was Llandogo Halt, serving a sizable community, and then Brockweir Halt, although the village of Brockweir <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the river, requiring a ferry crossing until a bridge was built in 1906.|$|E

25|$|The Carthaginian {{victory in}} the Battle of Lake Trasimene had removed the Roman {{consular}} army which had prevented the Carthaginians from marching on Rome. The second Roman consular army in Northern Italy, under Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the Apennine mountains, near Ariminum, {{and it was in}} no position to hinder Hannibal from marching south. This force also had lost most of its reconnaissance capabilities as its cavalry of 4,000 men had been destroyed in an ambush by Hannibal's lieutenant Maharbal possibly near Assisi, immediately after the battle of Lake Trasimene. The Roman army retreated back to Ariminum after this debacle, and was busy checking the Gallic raids taking place near the Po valley. The initiative now rested with Hannibal, and the Romans had temporarily lost the ability to defend their Italian allies until a new army could be raised.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 {{the long}} {{wait for a}} victory in a final ended at last, with the club lifting the West Of Scotland Cup after a replay against Vale of Clyde. The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation {{exercised}} a compulsory purchase order on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new housing scheme (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby.|$|E
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the only way the salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and {{was on its way to}} the O-5 site.|$|E

25|$|As {{tensions}} between Charles I and Parliament mounted in 1641, Charles courted support and raised funds simultaneously by creating numerous knights and baronets. Wolryche was knighted at Whitehall Palace on 22 July 1641 {{and created the}} first of the Wolryche baronets on 4 August 1641. This was no guarantee of loyalty to the king when conflict came: a considerable part of the Shropshire landed gentry, including baronets and close relatives of Wolryche, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> His sister Elizabeth and her husband John Puleston were committed Presbyterians and she was forced to flee their Flintshire home. The influence of the militantly royalist Francis Ottley, whose sister, Ursula, Wolryche had married in 1625, seems to have been decisive in making him act for the king. Ottley, unlike Wolryche himself, was politically committed and well-informed, retaining a correspondent in London to help him follow developments. Wolryche accepted a commission to collect the Poll Tax in 1641 and during the summer of 1642, with both Charles and Parliament mobilising for possible war, both he and Ottley received Commissions of array from the king. Wolryche was already experienced in captaining a county militia company.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 15 January, the Japanese {{captured}} a number of barges moored on the southern bank of the Muar river and towed them overstream to flank both the town of Muar and the Indian garrison's only reserve battalion. Packed barges and junks were making {{their way across the}} river mouth, meeting no resistance except a subsequent brush with an Indian patrol, which retired after a brief exchange of shots. The patrol never alerted headquarters that the Japanese were on the south bank. As day broke, the outflanking force surprised a company of the 7/6th Rajputana Rifles, and routed them. The remaining three Indian companies (two from the 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles and another from the Rajputana Rifles) on the north bank were cut off and captured soon after, without the main garrison at Muar even realising that an entire Japanese division <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the river. By noon, they were attacking from upstream both Muar Town and the garrison's line of communications with its only reserve battalion, 4/9th Jat Regiment, which was located near Bakri, on the main road south from Muar.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh grade teacher, to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
