5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a white <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> she was {{offended}} by {{him in her}} family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, a North Carolina <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> that DNA testing by the Toronto-based company Accu-Metrics {{showed that}} she, her mother, {{and her brother}} have Beothuk DNA. Geneticists have {{challenged}} the company's claim as bogus, both because the database it claimed to have is non-existent, and because previous analyses of the only reference Beothuk DNA available, from Nonosabasut and his wife Demasduit, show that it is far too fragmentary to make such an identification. The company suspended its claims after being challenged by geneticists and news media.|$|E
25|$|In Part 2 of his report, Usher {{stated that}} there were two deaths in recent years at the Casa that {{warranted}} investigations, but no one was charged. He also reported that in 2010, when de Faria visited Sedona, Arizona, the police department investigated him because a <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> he took her hands and placed them on his genitals; Mr de Faria also tried to pull down her skirt. The case never went to court; one of his associates encouraged the woman to drop the allegations.|$|E
25|$|The moon never rose again, and {{the people}} {{wondered}} what had happened until the man she had rescued remembered and told what he had seen. A wise woman sent them into the bog until they found a coffin (the stone), a candle (the will-o'-the-wyke), and a cross (the snag); the moon would be nearby. They did as the wise <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.|$|E

[...] Many guests also praised the smoothness of the ride and how the renovated main entrance is very appealing. On GateKeeper's opening weekend, Cedar Point achieved its most successful opening weekend in the history of the park, due to the popularity of GateKeeper.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{established}} the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, {{with the aim}} of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> she was assaulted by one of Reich's associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children's [...] "blockages." [...] Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

500|$|Although Mary I and Elizabeth I {{differed}} religiously, both performed elaborate Maundy ceremonies. [...] Records from 1556 {{show that}} Mary washed {{the feet of}} forty-one poor women (reflecting her age) while [...] "ever on her knees", and gave them forty-one pence each, as well as gifts of bread, fish, and clothing, donating her own gown to the <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> to be poorest of all. [...] In 1572, disliking the scenes as each woman tried to secure {{a piece of the}} royal gown, Queen Elizabeth granted a sum of £1 to each recipient in lieu of the gown, giving it in a red purse. [...] Contemporary writer William Lambarde noted that the money was substituted for the gown [...] "to avoid trouble of suite, which accustomabile was made for that perferment". [...] In years in which plague was rife, the monarch did not attend, sending an official, usually the Lord High Almoner, to make the distributions and perform the pedilavium. [...] Even though scented water was used to disguise any unpleasant odours from the poor, the feet were washed three times before the monarch performed the pedilavium, once by a menial and twice by Court officials. [...] In later years, sweet-smelling nosegays were used to disguise odours—the nosegays are still carried today.|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
500|$|William Safire of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "have a nice day" [...] first {{appeared}} in the 1948film A Letter to Three Wives. The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms stated that [...] "have a nice day" [...] first came into being in 1920, and the phrase and its variants became widely used after the 1950s. In 1964, Carol Reed of WCBS-TV spread the phrase in the New York metropolitan area by closing her weather reports with [...] "have a happy day", which, according to Safire, is a variant of [...] "have a nice day". The 1960s saw the phrase [...] "have a good day" [...] become prevalent and supersede [...] "happy day". Numerous hippies, when parting, told each other to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a beautiful day". In 1970, [...] "have a nice city" [...] was a mayoralty slogan in San Francisco. In 1972, during the Vietnam War, family members of POW/MIA members of the American armed forces participated in South Boston's Saint Patrick's Day march. They carried a black banner that read [...] "POW/MIA Families Never Have a Nice Day". They received scowls and jeers from a hostile crowd. One <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "They should be shot for bringing this here." ...|$|E
