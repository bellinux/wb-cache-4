She appeared in an ensemble designed by Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci exposing both her breasts and buttocks. Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating [...] "We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world. When it comes to women’s rights <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement".|$|E
500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> denial about that hard truth".|$|E

"While NIAID is {{an active}} {{participant}} in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, {{it is important to recognize}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented," [...] Fauci said.|$|E

2500|$|Bloomberg is {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} {{of free trade}} and is strongly opposed to protectionism, stating, [...] "The {{things that we have}} to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country...." [...] He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries: [...] "The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us. I hope they are wrong. I hope those who think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> good shape are right. But nevertheless, the time to address these issues is right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{have found}} that almost all {{disorders}} and diseases that affect humans reflect the interplay between the environment and their genes; however <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> {{the initial stages of}} understanding the specific role genes play on common disorders and diseases. For example, while news reports may give a different impression, most cancer is NOT inherited. [...] It is therefore likely that the recent rise in the rates of cancer worldwide can be at least partially attributed to the {{rise in the number of}} synthetic and otherwise toxic compounds found in our society today. [...] Thus, in the near future, public health genomics, and more specifically environmental health, will become an important part of the future healthcare-related issues.|$|E
2500|$|The Freedom and Justice Party's Gamal Heshmat said: [...] "There is {{absolutely}} no direction towards violence. The Brotherhood are not raised on violence. Their cause is a peaceful one, defending their rights, which is stronger than a [...] "military coup". The army has perpetrated a [...] "shameful coup". <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the street, we still don't know {{if all of the}} armed forces will accept what Sisi has done." [...] A party spokesman said that what started as a military coup was [...] "turning into something much more." [...] The National Salvation Front, an alliance of multiple political parties, stated on 4 July that [...] "what Egypt is witnessing now is not a military coup by any standards. It was a necessary decision that the Armed Forces’ leadership took to protect democracy, maintain the country's unity and integrity, restore stability and get back on track towards achieving the goals of the January 25 Revolution." ...|$|E

60|$|After a {{while the}} path led us along a railed precipice, and we looked over--far beneath us was the snug parlor again, the little Gasternthal, with its water jets {{spouting}} {{from the face of}} its rock walls. We could have dropped a stone into it. <b>We</b> had <b>been</b> finding {{the top of the world}} all along--and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead; when we looked down into the Gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last, but it was not so; there were much higher altitudes to <b>be</b> scaled yet. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the pleasant shade of forest trees, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the many-tinted luster of innumerable wild flowers.|$|R

2500|$|EMI {{released}} the five-CD box set Bassey – The EMI/UA Years 1959–1979 in 1994. The accompanying booklet {{opened with a}} poem by Marc Almond. Bassey collaborated with Chris Rea in the film La Passione (1996), appearing in the film as herself and releasing the single [...] "'Disco' La Passione". The remix of this single charted just outside the UK top 40. Bassey's [...] "History Repeating" [...] (1997), written for her by the Propellerheads, reached No. 1 on the UK Dance Chart, and No. 10 on the US Dance Chart. It was also a Top 10 hit in Italy. The liner notes of the Propellerheads' album Decksandrumsandrockandroll included the lines: [...] "We would like to extend our maximum respect to Shirley Bassey for honouring us with her performance. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> shock...." [...] Bassey celebrated her 60th birthday in 1997 with two open-air concerts, at Castle Howard and Althorp Park, and another TV special. The resulting live album The Birthday Concert received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance. On 7 October 1998 in Egypt, Bassey performed for a benefit at an open-air concert close to the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid. Bassey played the Friday night at Henley festival in 1984.|$|E

It <b>was</b> true, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> {{the rear of the}} party that had committed the deeds at Mooseridge; but the Onondago no longer followed its trail; pursuing a different course, or one that led directly to his object.|$|R
60|$|There was a woman--on {{the great}} drift {{down out of}} Europe, a weary drift of many generations, when we brought into India the shorthorn cattle and the {{planting}} of barley.

All of these heroics, unfortunately, were overshadowed by a single draw play from the eight-yard line." ...|$|R

60|$|During {{the time}} of my illness, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> London, where Mrs. Woodcourt had come, on my {{guardian}}'s invitation, to stay with us. When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way--though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me--I resumed my work and my chair beside his. He had appointed the time himself, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone.|$|R
6000|$|MARTHA--[With a sad smile.] I'm glad of that, dear. I tried my best {{to conceal}} it from you.

60|$|This was, indeed, a good {{diversion}} to us; but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> a wild place, and {{our guide}} very much hurt, {{and what to}} do we hardly knew: the howling of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never heard any thing that filled me with so much horror.|$|R

60|$|In {{regard to}} these matters {{there is much}} about which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> ignorance.

"Mr. Hodder," [...] he said, [...] "in {{one respect}} {{seems to be}} under the {{delusion}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the Middle Ages, instead of the twentieth century, since he assumes the right to meddle with the lives of his parishioners, to be the sole judge of their actions. That assumption will not, be tolerated by free men. I, for one, gentlemen, do not, propose to have a socialist for the rector of the church which I attend and support.
