5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency {{in the way in which}} decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> be merely a question of time.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in track}} laying and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, construction {{was reported to}} be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of synchronisation, TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the Siemens test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.|$|E

5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began running through the new line on October 9, 2016, with <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started running through the subway in November 2016.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{difference between these}} two approaches is that the first approach gives some <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> one's prior experience of tossing coins, while the second does not. The question of how much <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> give to prior experience, depending on the quality (credibility) of that experience, is discussed under credibility theory.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a new text feature {{selection}} method symmetrical strength of N-Grams (SSNG method) has been introduced.

5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models {{of the ship and}} metal <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E
5|$|Land mine: Textual {{evidence}} suggests that the first use of a land mine in history was by a Song Dynasty brigadier general known as Lou Qianxia, who used an 'enormous bomb' (huo pao) to kill Mongol soldiers invading Guangxi in 1277. However, the first detailed description of the land mine was given in the Huolongjing text written by Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the late Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) and early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Jiao and Liu wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, and their fuses ignited by a mechanism tripped by enemy movement; although Jiao and Liu did not describe this trip mechanism in full detail, a later text of 1606 revealed that enemy movement released a pin that allowed hidden underground <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> fall and spin a chord around an axle that rotated a spinning wheel acting as a flint to spark a train of fuses.|$|E

30|$|We {{observed}} that the weight assignment process of the MI, IG, DFS, and χ ^ 2 are {{as described in the}} literature. The MI gives highest <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> rare N-Grams like “penalty shootout” and “penalty corner”, but very less <b>weight</b> (near <b>to</b> zero) to common N-Grams “beautifully” and “play”, which is the cause of its low performance. Similarly, the IG assigns highest <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> “penalty corner” instead of “penalty shootout” and give more <b>weight</b> <b>to</b> “play” than “beautifully”. It is due to its biased nature towards the terms distributed in many categories. Although, its performance is quite better than MI, but performs slightly lower than SSNG & χ ^ 2.|$|R
5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point <b>weights</b> <b>to</b> 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
