Pink Martini made its European debut at the Cannes Film Festival in 1997 and its orchestral debut with the Oregon Symphony in 1998 under the direction of Norman Leyden. Since then, the band has gone on to play with more than 50 orchestras around the world, including multiple engagements with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Boston Pops, the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center, the San Francisco Symphony, and the BBC Concert Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall in London. Other appearances include the grand opening of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, with return sold-out engagements for New Year's Eve 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2011; two sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall; the opening party of the remodeled Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Governor's Ball at the 80th Annual Academy Awards in 2008; the opening of the 2008 Sydney Festival in Australia; two sold-out concerts at Paris' legendary L'Olympia Theatre in 2011; and Paris' fashion house Lanvin's 10-year anniversary celebration for designer Alber Elbaz in 2012 In its twentieth year, Pink Martini was inducted into both the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame and the Oregon Music Hall of Fame.|$|E

In this paper, housing policy is used to illustrate asset-based policy for the poor. Rather than increasing income-based rent subsidies, asset-based housing policy would promote homeownership.

This could be reduced by better integrating the virtual world of the computer with the real world of the user. In all the traditional interaction styles (command, menu, direct manipulation) the user can not mix real world objects with virtual objects in the same interface space. They also do not take into considerations the enormous potential of human hands to interact with real and virtual world objects.

40|$|Playing Orff {{instruments}} provides {{students with}} a wide variety of opportunities to explore creative musicianship. This article examines the benefits of classroom instrument study, common challenges encountered, and viable teaching strategies to promote student success. The ability to remove notes from barred instruments makes note accuracy more accessible, freeing students to focus on more sophisticated musical elements related to balance, blend, and dynamics. In addition, many Orff arrangements are easy to learn because of the common use of simple ostinato figures and limited harmonic structures. Although these patterns may be simple to grasp, they can be difficult to perform with rhythmic control. Students often rush the beat, causing faulty precision within the ensemble. Within a few measures, ensemble unity can be lost. Teaching solutions offered in this article focus on strategies related to technique development, efficient diagnosis, and effective modeling.
