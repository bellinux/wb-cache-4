5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, Walker spoke by {{telephone}} with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter {{and said the}} most serious threat was along {{the boundary between the}} U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the company}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that Greenside Mine {{contained}} sufficient reserves of ore {{to enable the}} large-scale mining operation {{which would make it}} profitable. They proposed taking a two-year option on the mine, during which they would refurbish the property and prove its resources, paying the landowners a dead rent of £90 per year. Many terms of the old leases they rejected as inappropriate to a large, modern mining company.

25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna {{at the head of the}} right and the left horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with an unending stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It was as if there were more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E

25|$|Once again, Akers' {{kick and}} Ware's return placed the Giants in good field position, with Manning {{beginning}} the drive at the Giants' 36-yard line with 1:10 left. However, the drive began with two incomplete passes, {{and after a}} third-down sack by DT Trevor Laws put the Giants at their own 29-yard line, the Giants called a timeout as the play clock was about to expire on fourth down with 12 seconds left. Officials then ruled to reset the game clock to 0:14 as the Giants' punt team and the Eagles' punt return team came onto the field. The snap from long snapper Zak DeOssie to punter Matt Dodge was high, and Dodge hastily kicked a line drive punt to Jackson rather than kicking {{the ball out of}} bounds. Jackson received the ball at the Eagles' 35-yard line and immediately muffed the catch before picking the ball up and backpedaling to the 30-yard line. (This was later claimed by some to cause the Giants' coverage to collapse, ironically assisting Jackson.) Jackson ran through a group of Giants and made it to midfield before receiving a huge block by WR Jason Avant on DeOssie, leaving no one in front of Jackson {{on the way to the}} end zone (Avant actually gave himself a concussion on the block, and both players were left lying on the field for the rest of the play). Ware followed Jackson but could not catch him. After the clock hit 0:00, Jackson ran parallel to the goal line across most of the width of the field—according to Jackson after the game, because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> the clock had expired, though some observers believed it to be due to his showboating nature — before advancing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. With no flags on the field, Jackson threw the ball into the New Meadowlands stands in celebration as the team gathered around him near the end zone. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was so livid he threw his play sheet and notes onto the ground and ran onto the field before Jackson even reached the end zone, yelling at Dodge for not punting the ball out of bounds. Per NFL rules, Akers came out to kick the extra point and the Eagles won the game 38–31.|$|E

Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E
