Davidson said, [...] "Everybody has his or her own demonsand makes their own choices due to their creative process." [...] In other interviews, Eric Braeden, who portrays Adam's father Victor Newman, stated his disappointment with Engen's departure, and told Soap Opera Digest that he unsuccessfully tried to convince the actor to stay with the soap opera. Braeden stated, [...] "He was somewhat disturbed {{by the fact that he}} was playing this evil character. I said, 'Listen, I remember Victor feeding rats to people.' I told him to embrace it because he had the most riveting storyline around, period." [...] In another interview with Soaps In Depth, Braeden said that he too was [...] "saddened by the fact that he left", saying it was a [...] "hell of a role". Braeden also said, [...] "Whatever personal reasons he has, you've got to respect that. But he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> guy, very professional. We all liked working with him. We were shocked when he decided to leave, but that's his personal decision." [...] After the controversy surrounding his departure from the show, Engen posted a message on his Myspace page stating he had been unhappy with Adam's storyline long before the homosexual plot twist had emerged.|$|E

500|$|The {{first guest}} stars {{to appear on}} the show were actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, reuniting for their first joint TV project in 33 years since the 1960s sitcom McHale's Navy. They {{appeared}} as SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's creative director, enjoyed the actors' roles in McHale's Navy, and they already wanted the two to provide the voices of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy when they were voice casting. Hillenburg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. When coming up for the right voice of Mermaid Man, Borgnine cracked his voice by mistake when he was saying [...] "evil!" [...] He said, [...] "By golly! We started something... and we kept [...] in."

What meant a lot was the movie, having worked in 25 Watts was {{important}} {{for me and my}} career," [...] said Hendler. In 25 Watts, Hendler plays a youngster from a quiet neighborhood of Montevideo who wanders without a clear direction {{while at the same time}} has to study for a test of Italian and has a crush on his tutor. Filmed in 2000 with a very low budget, the film revitalized the Uruguayan film and aided by the awards received in Europe (Best Film at the International Film Festival Rotterdam) marked the beginning of a new stage in the film scene of that country. Almost ten years after its release, Hendler said in an interview, [...] "It was a novelty to see an Uruguayan movie that didn't submit the mate, the Palacio Salvo, and the promenade as a justification for being, was a story of some neighborhood guys." ...|$|E
