5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E
5|$|Metternich's {{primary focus}} {{remained}} on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator. He was also concerned by liberal-minded Ioannis Kapodistrias' increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing {{large areas of}} the declining Ottoman Empire (the so-called Eastern Question). As he had earlier envisaged, by April 1818 Britain had drawn up, and Metternich pushed through, proposals to have a Congress at Aachen, then a Prussian frontier town, six months later. Meanwhile, Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of Karlsbad to treat the rheumatic tension in his back. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> month-long trip, although it was there he received news of {{the death of his father}} at the age of 72. He visited the family estate at Königswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues. He could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg. Travelling with Emperor Francis, he was warmly greeted by the Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards Aachen. He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind. As discussions began, Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers. The former was agreed almost immediately; but on the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance. Metternich rejected the Tsar's idealistic plans for (among other things) a single European army. His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on freedom of speech was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the reign}} of Paul I, Czartoryski was in high favour and on the closest terms of {{intimacy}} with the Tsar, who in December 1798 appointed him ambassador {{to the court of}} Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. On reaching Italy, Czartoryski found that that monarch was a king without a kingdom, so that the outcome of his first diplomatic mission <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> tour through Italy to Naples, the acquisition of the Italian language, and a careful exploration of the antiquities of Rome.|$|E

The club finished 12th in Serie C1 in the season 1992–93, but due to financial difficulties the FIGC cancelled all professional football activity for Messina.|$|E

It appears that Denys held the farm until his death in 1422, although records are not available to confirm this. A cadet branch of the Denys family became lords of the manor of Pucklechurch, probably in the 16th century, and continuing until the death of William Dennis in 1701, last of the male line.|$|E

Talley had only 123 yards {{in the first four}} games of the year. Fullback Mark Pierce also had a 44-yard run on a fourth-and-one, with Matt Jones adding a 70-yard touchdown scamper in the fourth quarter.|$|E

25|$|Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's {{division}} {{was on the}} Union right flank. The majority of his men passed through Hanover {{early in the morning}} of June 30, pausing briefly for refreshments and to receive the greetings of the jubilant townspeople. Their town had been raided three days before by Confederate Lt. Col. Elijah V. White's cavalry, attached to Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division that had occupied York County. White's Virginians and Marylanders had followed the railroad to Hanover from nearby Gettysburg, and taken horses, food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and other desired items from the townspeople, often paying with valueless Confederate money or drafts on the Confederate government. White's raiders had destroyed the area's telegraph wires, cutting off communications with the outside world, before sacking the nearby Hanover Junction train station. The unexpected arrival of Kilpatrick's column <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> surprise to the residents of Hanover, who warmly greeted the Union troopers with food and drink.|$|E

500|$|Not {{long after}} its construction, a small suburb or village with a church was {{established}} by local farmers and traders just outside the fort. According to medieval chronicler William of Tyre, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> spot where conditions of life for people of the lower ranks were better than in cities". The population of the village consisted of indigenous Eastern Orthodox Christians allied to and protected by the Crusader administration and garrison based in the fort. The inhabitants were considered lower-class, but integral members of society by the Crusaders of European or mixed descent. Because Darom was absent of Greek bishops, in 1168 Pope Alexander III gave the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem direct jurisdiction over the dioceses, putting the largely Greek Orthodox inhabitants {{under the authority of}} the Catholic Church.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Fort Worth Star-Telegram contributor Robert Philpot, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ rating, thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> surprise and an indication that there [...] "might be some life" [...] left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{also noted that the}} episode showed that Will & Grace still had a bit of life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ". Dana Stevens of Slate magazine reported that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] offered a chance to punch up the show with some [...] "unusually broad sight gags." [...] She wrote that the real reason to watch the episode were the mistakes made by the actors.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in May 2009. She also {{thought that it}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> episode but that it [...] "never {{approaches}} greatness". She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up {{the ending of the}} episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that {{it had been years since}} he had worked the helm of a ship. He summed it up saying that, [...] "ultimately, it's a rehash of a Wesley Crusher episode. A really really bad Wesley Crusher episode" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> way {{to return to}} the series, and was glad the harvest festival would give the {{characters}} something specific to focus on. However, Fowler felt {{there was a lack of}} closure over Tom's resentment in the episode of Ron dating Wendy. Joel Keller of TV Squad felt the new Chris and Ben characters served as a strong springboard into the third season, and that the premiere episode lived up to the anticipation caused by the show's long hiatus. However, Keller said Tom's continued pining for Wendy felt [...] "a little protracted at this point". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the episode and said the parks department employees taking drastic steps to save their department reflected Parks efforts to seek out higher ratings. Kandell, however, felt introducing Chris' tragic back story in the episode felt rushed. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic called the episode consistently funny, and said the new characters Ben and Chris were starting to hit their stride. However, Hochberger said Eduardo subplot felt like a contrived device to continue keeping April and Andy apart. Not all reviews were entirely positive. David Hinckley of New York Daily News called Parks and Recreation [...] "a good show that could be a better show", claiming it falls short of other NBC comedies like 30 Rock. Hinckley cited the basketball game with Andy, Ron and Tom as a scene that feels too much like a sketch comedy bit rather than a natural progression of the script. Nick Purdy of Paste said the addition of new cast members Chris and Ben may have diluted the rest of the cast's talents, and that the episode felt as if it had [...] "too many plates spinning", leaving not enough screentime for strong characters like April Ludgate and Ron Swanson.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasant</b> yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we get a glimpse of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E
