However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} <b>wave</b> <b>vector.</b> This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above.

Analysis reveals additional new regimes of surface polariton resonances with magnetic materials for s- and p-polarized light.

40|$|International audienceWe present new {{results on}} <b>wave</b> <b>vectors</b> and Poynting vectors of chorus {{rising and falling}} tones {{on the basis of}} 6 years of THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) observations. The {{majority}} of <b>wave</b> <b>vectors</b> is closely aligned with the direction of the ambient magnetic field (B 0). Oblique <b>wave</b> <b>vectors</b> are confined to the magnetic meridional plane, pointing away from Earth. Poynting vectors are found to be almost parallel to B 0. We show, for the first time, that slightly oblique Poynting vectors are directed away from Earth for rising tones and toward Earth for falling tones. For the majority of lower band chorus elements, the mutual orientation between Poynting <b>vectors</b> and <b>wave</b> <b>vectors</b> can be explained by whistler mode dispersion in a homogeneous collisionless cold plasma. Upper band chorus seems to require inclusion of collisional processes or taking into account azimuthal anisotropies in the propagation medium. The latitudinal extension of the equatorial source region can be limited to ± 6 o around the B 0 minimum or approximately ± 5000 km along magnetic field lines. We find increasing Poynting flux and focusing of Poynting vectors on the B 0 direction with increasing latitude. Also, <b>wave</b> <b>vectors</b> become most often more field aligned. A smaller group of chorus generated with very oblique wave normals tends to stay close to the whistler mode resonance cone. This suggests that close to the equatorial source region (within  20 o latitude), a wave guidance mechanism is relevant, for example, in ducts of depleted or enhanced plasma density...|$|R
