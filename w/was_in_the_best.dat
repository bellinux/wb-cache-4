5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the brothers {{to send them to}} live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were {{to keep them out of}} trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season as the Broncos' coach in 1965, Speedie's team posted a 4–10 record. After two losses to begin the 1966 season, Speedie {{resigned}} and assistant Ray Malavasi took over. He said the move <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the club. Speedie had a 6-19-1 record as the Broncos' coach. He then accepted a scouting position with the organization and was based out of his home in Laguna Hills, California. He held the post {{until his retirement in}} 1982.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin said he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> position {{that he had been}} in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
40|$|Nevada’s {{relocation}} statute {{does not}} apply to parties that share joint custody of minor children. If a parent with joint custody rights wants to move outside of Nevada with a minor child, then that parent must file a motion with a district court judge to determine whether moving <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of <b>the</b> child or whether staying with <b>the</b> nonmoving parent <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of <b>the</b> child. ...|$|R

5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> shape, not having {{been involved in the}} Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, {{the last part of the}} corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E
5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> position to judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> shape, {{almost as good as}} when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

On May 5, 2009 Joe Blake was named the finalist for the chancellor position.|$|E
25|$|In March 2005, GSA {{issued a}} request for {{information}} (RFI) and received more than 20 responses.

25|$|Avery's first {{motion picture}} role (other than {{a bit in}} the film version of Winged Victory) was as Marjorie in the 1951 film Queen for a Day based on the popular radio and {{television}} show hosted by Jack Bailey. In 1952, she played Tracy McAuliffe, the wife of the Charlton Heston character in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Ruby Gentry. She also <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Best</b> Things in Life Are Free (1956).|$|E
25|$|In September, U.S. President James Buchanan sent General Winfield Scott to {{negotiate}} with Governor Douglas and resolve the growing crisis. This <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the United States, as sectional tensions within the country were increasing, soon to culminate in the Civil War. Scott had calmed two other border crises {{between the two nations}} in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Douglas.|$|E
25|$|Around 1971 an {{approach}} {{was made to}} BR seeking to purchase Class 22 D6319. A price was agreed but before the new owners could retrieve their purchase, it was scrapped at Swindon Works. British Railways, embarrassed, offered the would-be owners their choice of the remaining Warships (D810/D812/D821 and D832) for the same price. D821 was chosen as it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> mechanical condition and thus became the first preserved ex-BR mainline diesel locomotive.|$|E

30|$|We {{draw the}} {{following}} conclusions from Tables  2 and  3. First, the new IQA method correlates well with human opinion scores over all four publicly available image databases; the overall results of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results {{except for the}} SROCC on TID 2008. Second, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first average case the proposed method performs better than its competitors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second average case, the proposed method performs better than its competitors in LCC. Meanwhile, <b>in</b> this case <b>the</b> SROCC average performance of the proposed method is only 0.0422 worse than the ILNIQE. Third, the SROCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN and GBLUR on CSIQ, and JEPG 2000 on TID 2008. The LCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two values for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN on CSIQ, and JPEG 2000 on TID 2008. Even in other circumstances where the prediction results <b>are</b> not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two, <b>the</b> results of the proposed method maintain competitiveness. Fourth, the newly proposed method outperforms LQF for almost all distortion types. Hence, the features we choose {{for the construction of}} the visual word dictionary are more quality aware. Fifth, when aimed at multiple distortion types, the newly proposed method is adaptable and has an obvious advantage; the SROCC and LCC metrics for the proposed method are among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results. Additionally, the two metrics <b>are</b> approximately 0.9 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comparison experiments conducted on the LiveMD 1 database.|$|R
25|$|Rajaraja, {{the clever}} leader he was, {{thought that it}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{interests}} of the Cholas {{to see that the}} Eastern Chalukyas did not make common cause with their cousins in the west, for such a coalition would constitute a challenge to the rising Chola power. He decided to befriend the weaker Eastern Chalukyas against the stronger Western Chalukyas and create the traditional sphere of balance of power in South India.|$|E
25|$|With {{very little}} Canadian {{production}} prior to 1965, American Motors <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{position of the}} U.S. automakers {{to take advantage of}} the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement. This plant also allowed AMC to export cars within Commonwealth countries at a favorable tariff rate, making AMC the number one US nameplate in markets such as Trinidad and Jamaica in the 1960s. The assembly of Ambassador models was moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin while production of Ramblers and Rebels increased. By 1969, the output of AMC's Brampton operation was destined to the eastern half of the continent while Kenosha supplied the western regions.|$|E
25|$|While the throw-pass was in effect, {{particularly}} during the early 1940s, there were talks between the VFA and VFL towards re-amalgamating the two bodies. Although the throw-pass had been a great success for the VFA, {{it was felt that}} a single controlling body for football in Victoria playing under a uniform set of rules <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of football as a whole. Negotiations for an amalgamation took place over several years, but broke down several times over a variety of issues, including representation at board level, Australian National Football Council representation, and a promotion and relegation structure between the VFA and VFL.|$|E

25|$|The Postal Services Act 1987 {{split the}} then New Zealand Post Office into New Zealand Post Limited (trading as NZPost), Telecom New Zealand Limited (trading as Telecom) and Post Office Bank Limited (trading as PostBank, sold to ANZ in 1989) {{and all three}} {{industries}} progressively deregulated. The selling price of Telecom was considered {{by some to be}} extremely low, given that Telecom had a monopoly of all phone lines in New Zealand at the time. There has been debate as to whether privatisation <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, although others consider that the capital requirements to modernise the network were better provided by private enterprise than the government.|$|E
