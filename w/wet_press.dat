40|$|AbstractLaser {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial processes for several decades. The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is longitudinal cutting of paper web (edge trimming). There are few locations at a paper making machine where edge trimming is usually done: <b>wet</b> <b>press</b> section, calender or rewinder. Paper web is characterized with different moisture content at different points of the paper making machine. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of moisture content of paper material on laser cutting parameters. Effect of moisture content on cellulose fibers, laser absorption and energy needed for cutting is described as well. Laser cutting tests were carried out using CO 2 laser...|$|E

40|$|To make paper {{products}} water repelling, a hydrophobic chemical, known as size, {{is added to}} the pulp slurry in the wet end of the paper machine. It can be shown that size prevents water from penetrating the fiber structure, by measuring the contact angle between a droplet of water and a sized paper surface. More sizing will result in higher contact angle and thus less penetration. The traditional view on the penetration of water based inks, is that the ink behaves as water in terms of penetration. Thus, it is considered that sizing has the effect of preventing water based inks from penetrating paper. However, studies made by Viet Hoang and Huy Ly at the Australian Pulp and Paper Institute, APPI, revealed that normal sizing had no effect on the penetration of water based inks. The present work was an extended study of the effect of sizing on the ink penetration profile of water based inks. It was decided to study the effect of four levels of sizing on the penetration depth of two water-based inks. As the effect of refining and pressing was also believed to {{have an effect on the}} penetration depth, three levels of each were included in the study. Pulp provided by the Australian Paper’s Maryvale mill was beaten in the Valley Beater to three different Canadian standard freeness values. Unsized and sized hand sheets were made in the Moving Belt Drainage Former and were <b>wet</b> <b>pressed</b> to three different levels. The measured paper properties were contact angle, grammage and thickness. Sheets from different refining and pressing groups were then printed in full tone with yellow Hewlett-Packard and magenta Epson inks. The ink penetration profile was then analyzed using the confocal microscope. The results show that when printing with water-based yellow and magenta inks the effect of sizing on the penetration depth was generally insignificant. This shows that water-based inks do not behave as water when penetrating the paper sheet. Thus, sizing can not be applied to prevent ink from penetrating paper. The only cases where a clear decrease in penetration, due to sizing, could be seen, was for sheets made from pulp with a low level of refining and for highly <b>wet</b> <b>pressed</b> sheets.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate how physical properties of laboratory sheets, made from different thermomechanical and chemithermomechanical pulps, depend on the pressure and temperature levels during pressing and drying. Sheets were formed from long fibre fractions, defined as the pulp retained on a 50 mesh wire in a Britt Dynamic Drainage Jar, and pressed and dried according to a number of different pressure and temperature settings. The results showed that there were large differences in the sheet properties depending on what type of method was used for pressing and drying. High freeness pulps were more sensitive than low freeness pulps to the methods used for pressing and drying. The results indicate that the difference in sheet properties between ISO and Rapid Kothen sheets may be {{explained by the fact that}} ISO sheets are <b>wet</b> <b>pressed</b> only at room temperature, the fibres are then allowed to spring back when pressure is released whereas the fibres in Rapid Kothen sheets are locked in their positions as the sheets are pressed and dried at high temperature until dry...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to examine interfiber bonding and fiber segment activation as basic phenomena: how different raw material parameters and fiber property distributions affect bonding and activation, and in turn, how bonding and activation relate to end use properties of paper, especially to strength, structural and hygroexpansional properties. The raw materials for this study consisted of eucalypt fibers. The findings of this thesis work confirm what has already been established about bonding: raw material parameters, fiber treatments and process parameters all {{play a significant role}} in bonding and bonding development. A new observation was the interdependence of interfiber bonding and fiber network activation for structural and strength properties and the link observed between hygroexpansion and fiber network activation. Fiber size analyses were made with an optical analyzer that applies image analysis techniques on single fibers. The effects of fiber length, fiber width, fiber wall thickness, fines content and fiber curl distributions on the quality potential of eucalypt fibers were evaluated. The results of this work improved the understanding of the effects of fiber property distribution characteristics on paper technical properties. Fiber curl and fiber wall thickness were found to be the most promising fiber parameters in the evaluation of eucalypt fiber quality potential. In the development of parameters derived from fiber property distributions, the variations in paper technical properties were most often explained with fiber curl and fiber wall thickness. In addition to metafiber properties developed during this study (<b>wet</b> <b>pressed</b> density and activation parameter), more explicatory power was sought from the structure of fiber wall by means of simple water retention value and fiber saturation point measurements, differential scanning calorimetry, and by using solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance measurements...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for fungal attack is {{incomplete}} drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterwards, or in collections that become wet later through flood, other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the tropics. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being <b>wet</b> before being <b>pressed</b> or having water-retaining or succulent parts. Specimens with sugary exudations or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying {{to ensure that they}} dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% ethanol or methylated spirits (denatured alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth.|$|R

In industrial practice, it is desirable to be able to predict, in an expeditious way, what the effects of a change in raw materials or the proportions thereof might be in the various processing steps towards the final product. When the property of interest is basically determined by the combination of raw materials, an optimisation methodology specific to the design of mixture experiments can be successfully used. In the present study, fired bending strength and linear firing shrinkage were selected as the properties to model. Ten formulations of three different clays were selected and used in the experiments design. Those formulations were <b>wet</b> processed, uniaxially <b>pressed,</b> and then fired at 1000 °C for 2 h [...] From the experimental results, regression models were calculated, relating each technological property with the proportions of raw materials.

40|$|Both {{fresh and}} ensiled sugar-beet pulp {{has a high}} feeding value and shows a {{positive}} dietetic effect on ruminal fermentation (Rohr et al., 1986; Formigoni et al., 1993). As far as the feeding value is con-cerned, this feed is comparable with feeding barley (Murphy, 1986), has a favourable energy concentra-tion and a relatively high content of fibre (Drennan, 1981). Boldt et al. (1990) compared production ef-ficiency of fresh, dried and ensiled pulp. However, fresh sugar-beet pulp is also a suitable medium for the propagation of epiphytic microorganisms, par-ticularly moulds, yeast and soil bacteria, which can cause a quick deterioration of this feedstuff. For a longer storage it is recommended to preserve this feed above all {{in the form of}} silage (Graf, 1981; Graf and Haluschan, 1981). Provided that the techno-logical conditions are maintained on an optimal level, the process of ensiling of pressed sugar-beet pulp usually runs without any marked problems. Haaksma (1991) concluded that already within the first two days after ensiling, the major part of su-crose was converted to monosaccharides and or-ganic acids, particularly lactic acid (LA) and acetic acid (AA) in amounts of 1. 2 – 1. 4 % and 0. 2 – 0. 4 %, resp., and that the pH-value decreased from 5. 5 to 3. 8.

This method {{is based on a}} papermaking process, whereby loose and short sisal fibers are dispersed into a water suspension containing bacterial cellulose. The fiber and nanocellulose suspension is then filtered (using vacuum or gravity) and the <b>wet</b> filter cake <b>pressed</b> to squeeze out any excess water, followed by a drying step. This will result in the hornification of the bacterial cellulose network, holding the loose natural fibers together. Our method is specially suited for the manufacturing of rigid and robust preforms of hydrophilic fibers. The porous and hydrophilic nature of such fibers results in significant water uptake, drawing in the bacterial cellulose dispersed in the suspension. The bacterial cellulose will then be filtered against the surface of these fibers, forming a bacterial cellulose coating. When the loose fiber-bacterial cellulose suspension is filtered and dried, the adjacent bacterial cellulose forms a network and hornified to hold the otherwise loose fibers together. The introduction of bacterial cellulose into the preform resulted in a significant increase of the mechanical properties of the fiber preforms. Thi...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} furnish in {{newsprint}} production is {{dictated by the}} raw material costs, production cost and the final quality demanded by printers. In addition to the raw material costs, energy cost {{is a major factor}} in papermaking economy. Modern newsprint machines have combinations of roll and shoe presses to increase web dryness to approximately 50 % after wet pressing and thus keeping drying cost as low as possible. Thermomechanical pulp and deinked pulp are commonly used for producing newsprint nowadays. The increasing use of deinked pulp and filler in newsprint production has improved press dewatering. However, {{there is a lack of}} published research on the effects of the nip types, furnish and filler distribution in the web on sheet dewatering and sheet structure after wet pressing. The dynamic wet pressing simulator at NTNU-PFI was used for the pressing experiments. A single sided dewatering setting was used. The <b>wet</b> <b>pressed</b> samples were freeze dried in liquid nitrogen after pressing. The cross-sections of the freeze dried samples were imaged in a SEM and the cross-sectional structures were quantified. The cross-section images were split into top, middle and felt or dewatering side layers based on equal solids per layer per line length. The Euclidean distance maps generated by ImageJ software were used to quantify the distribution of fines, pores size, porosity and thickness of the sample. To understand the filler, fibre and MFC interactions, images for surface characterization were acquired using FE-SEM. 3 D images for DIP and TMP samples pressed with shoe pulse were acquired using x-ray micro-(computed) tomography (X-μCT) for visual assessment of the densification across the sheet’s thickness. In addition, the surface roughness was quantified. As expected, deinked pulp (DIP) dewaters more easily than thermomechanical pulp (TMP) when pressed with a roll pulse. The in-plane moisture flow (crushing) in DIP samples started at higher peak pressure and higher solids content compared to the TMP samples. The TMP samples showed higher springback after wet pressing compared to DIP samples. When both TMP and DIP samples were designed to have a higher amount of small pores at the dewatering side’s surface layers, the samples with the coarser TMP pulp could achieve similar dryness as DIP samples when pressed with higher nip pressure. In addition, the DIP samples with the higher number of small pores at the dewatering layer also yielded lower dryness after pressing with roll pulse. The effect of filler (ground calcium carbonate, GCC) distribution in the paper’s zdirection on final dryness and sheet structure after the wet pressing with a roll pulse was also studied. The distribution of filler did not affect the maximum dryness after wet pressing (40 %) for sheets containing identical (13 %) amount of filler. However, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer dewater more easily and yield the 40 % maximum achievable dryness after wet pressing at a lower pressure. As a result, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer yielded higher thickness as compared to samples with filler distributed evenly in the z-direction. In the study on wet-pressing using two different shoe press pulse profiles, the samples made from TMP and DIP yielded identical after-press solids content. More water was pressed out of the TMP samples as compared to DIP samples since TMP samples had lower initial solids content. The wet webs with more porous structure in the dewatering layer yielded higher dryness after wet-pressing. This is a major advantage, as higher dryness after wet-pressing implies a reduction of steam consumption in the dryer. This study also showed that the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure at the end yielded higher solids content and apparently higher bulk after the wet-pressing compared to the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure in the beginning. Higher filler content in newsprint increases the risk of linting at the printing press. Recent advances in technology and research in producing microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) should enable the production of MFC with acceptable energy cost in the near future. MFC can be used to improve the strength properties of the paper. Optimal selection of MFC quality and filler content can improve the optical properties while maintaining or enhancing the surface strength of the sheets. Different qualities of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) were blended with TMP and ground calcium carbonate (GCC). The addition of MFC decreased the drainage rate of the pulp suspension but improved the strength properties. Wet pressing experiments showed that optimal use of MFC and filler could enhance the strength and optical properties without reducing the solids content after wet pressing. Field emission SEM revealed that the MFC particles adsorbed onto filler particles and fibres. The MFC binds the filler-MFC-fines aggregates to the fibre network, thus partly filled the pore network. As a result, MFC addition increased the air resistance and internal bonding of the sheet. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R

Observe, and smile! He may have been a wise man in his day; but, to us, the wisdom of the politician appears like folly, because we can compare its prognostics with actual results; and the old merchant seems to have busied himself about vanities, because we know that the expected ships have been lost at sea, or mouldered at the wharves; that his imported broadcloths were long ago worn to tatters, and his cargoes of wine quaffed to the lees; and that the most precious leaves of his ledger have become waste-paper. Yet, his avocations were not so vain as our philosophic moralizing.

Major Spence was the holder of a Distinguished Service Order for his part in ‘Sparrow Force’ in Timor, defending the airfield against the Japanese. In the 1950’s a new automatic printer, a Thompson Platen, was purchased. In 1960 Spences sold to Mary and Bernie Lewis and Stan and Maureen Busuttin. [...] Not long after this change of owners a new Model 14 linotype machine was delivered. It was replaced in 1976 by computers and, in the 1990’s, the Model 14 was donated to Proserpine Museum where it remains a central exhibit. Bernie and Mary Lewis’s son Peter and his wife, Cynthia, took full control of the business in 1972 and in 1974 moved the printery to a much larger premises at 16 Chapman Street in Proserpine. [...] The Guardian was the first country newspaper north of Brisbane to introduce the cold-type method of typesetting and printing. In later years the master copy was taken to Bowen, a distance of some sixty-five kilometres, rolled off the press at the Bowen Independent, and delivered back to Proserpine late at night before the day of the paper’s sale. The Lewis family, however, continued to print brochures and flyers on a three unit <b>wet</b> off-set printing <b>press,</b> purchased in 1989. Ultimately the paper’s title was changed to Whitsunday Coast Guardian. [...] Mary Lewis died in July of 2010 and Bernie Lewis followed on April 6, 2011, aged 93 years, two days after compiling his last editorial. In September of 2014 the Whitsunday Coast Guardian, after being privately owned for 110 years and being {{one of the few remaining}} like businesses, was sold by Cynthia and Peter Lewis to ADHOC, APN Australian [...] "Regional News.

6000|$|Fifty {{copies of}} the letters were in the {{possession}} of Curll by the 12th of May, and were speedily sold. Smythe sent for him at one o'clock to a tavern in Leicester Fields, and half an hour afterwards one hundred and ninety additional copies were brought by a couple of porters, who were directed to carry them to the shop of the bookseller. There they were immediately seized by an order from the House of Lords, and Curll was commanded to attend next day.[39] The peers in 1722 had voted it a breach of privilege to publish the writings of any member of their body without his consent. Curll, in an advertisement which appeared {{for the first time that}} morning, had given a list of the persons to whom Pope's letters were addressed, and among the names were those of the Earl of Halifax and the Earl of Burlington. To print letters to lords was no offence. It was necessary that there should be letters from them, and of this there was no other indication than that the list of names was followed by the words,--"with the respective answers of each correspondent."[40] Curll asserted that the advertisement came to him through Smythe,[41] and the proceedings founded upon it in the hour that it issued <b>wet</b> from the <b>press</b> were, as Johnson states, instigated by Pope, [...] "who attended to stimulate the resentment of his friends."[42] If he had never set eyes upon the book before it was published, curiosity would still have prompted him to turn over the leaves, and he must immediately have discovered that it did not contain a single letter from a peer. The wording of the advertisement may, therefore, be suspected to have been devised by him to afford a colour for what he must have known was a groundless prosecution. A committee was appointed to investigate the complaint. It met on the 14th of May, and the case would have ended as soon as it was begun, if Pope's spokesman, Lord Hay, who resided at Twickenham, and was one of his associates, had not adduced from a letter to Jervas a passage which he alleged to be a reflection on Lord Burlington. But the person who furnished the work to Curll had, by an elaborate device, provided against a charge which no one except its contriver could have foreseen. The fifty copies, which were sold on the morning of the 12th, before the power of the House of Lords was put in motion, contained the letter. Those which were furnished in the middle of the day, as if to meet the messenger sent to seize them, were all defective, and in every case the letter to Jervas was among the omissions.[43] Nor had the leaves which contained it been simply kept back, but every trace of it had been obliterated by an alteration at the printing-press. In the complete work the missing letter commenced on p. 115 of vol. ii.[44] and ended on p. 117. In the imperfect books a note on Trumbull, which began at p. 114, is carried on to the top of p. 115, and Pope's epitaph upon him, which appears in no other {{copies of the}} correspondence, is added to cover a little of the vacant space. The word [...] "Finis" [...] follows the note, though, in spite of this indication that the whole is concluded, the work recommences on p. 117 with the letters to Gay, which continue to p. 154.[45] The coincidence was far too extraordinary to be undesigned. Pope, who had incited the prosecution the very hour the book was published, and who had been in such haste to instruct Lord Hay that the debate in the House of Lords was concluded, and the sheets seized by two o'clock, could alone have adapted one batch to afford a pretext for the proceeding, and another batch to render the proceeding abortive,--he alone could have arranged the delivery of the respective parcels, and sent the fifty copies which contained the obnoxious passage, in time to be sold in the morning, and the one hundred and ninety copies in which it was wanting, just in time to be captured by the messenger from the House of Lords. His object was not to procure the confiscation of the correspondence, and stop the sale. He wished to simulate indignation, and divert suspicion from himself without interfering with the success of the work, and he conducted the prosecution with so much care to ensure defeat that we may readily credit the assertion of Curll, [...] "that the lords declared they had been made Pope's tools."[46] ...|$|R
