After he strove [...] "to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible" [...] into his Third Symphony, he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano.

500|$|Cardus often {{expressed}} views {{contrary to}} popular and critical opinion. He dismissed Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring as [...] "a sophisticated exploitation of primitive rum-ti-tum". When Harty introduced Gershwin's symphonic poem An American in Paris into a Hallé concert, Cardus proposed [...] "a 150 per cent [...] tariff against this sort of American dry-goods". He professed to think that Sullivan's [...] "preoccupation with comic opera, {{to the neglect of}} oratorio and symphony" [...] was a [...] "deplorable" [...] loss to English music, although he also wrote that without Gilbert, nothing of Sullivan's music would have survived. Cardus championed Delius against the consensus of his fellow-critics: [...] "His music looks back on days intensely lived through; it knows the pathos of mortal things doomed to fade and vanish". At the 1929 Delius Festival in London, Cardus briefly met the composer, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked too young to be The Manchester Guardians music critic, and counselled him: [...] "Don't read yourself daft. Trust to y'r emotions". Also against the grain of critical opinion, Cardus commended the then unfashionable music of Richard Strauss and Anton Bruckner.|$|E
