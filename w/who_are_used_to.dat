25|$|A young German soldier called Gunther is {{assigned}} {{to the care of}} Joey and Topthorn, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> draw an ambulance wagon. When his 14-year-old brother Michael is sent to the front line, Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert, hiding inside a nearby farm. The German Army soon tracks down the boys, and they are shot for desertion. However, the Germans leave without noticing Joey and Topthorn in the barn.|$|E
25|$|The younger {{generation}} and commoners, with minimal education still address each other using ty with no connotation of disrespect, however. Certain Russians <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> vy-address may perceive {{the ones who}} don’t differentiate between ty and vy forms as uneducated, offensive and uncultured. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} this honorific was not a Russian innovation. Instead, the use of vy in both the singular and plural form is due to the exposure to the Latin historical and political developments. The usage of vy did not spread throughout the Russian population quickly; as a result, the usage was inconsistent until the eighteenth century, when Vy became more prominent in secular literature.|$|E
25|$|This an {{opportunity}} to put people who would normally {{have no reason to}} interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, {{and all of a sudden}} they're together.|$|E

25|$|As both Korea and Taiwan {{had been}} under the {{domination}} of Japan for an indefinite amount of time, many citizens of both territories were forced to work under the Japanese military and experienced violence for a long time. These people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{be familiar with the}} harsh kind of treatment in their life combined with their anger towards the Japanese are then sent to Borneo to work as prison guards to replace the existing Japanese guards. In addition to their lack of knowledge and training for the treatment of POWs, many of them are involved in brutalising the POWs where the treatment of POWs are much worsened after the replacement of Japanese guards in Elopura by the Taiwanese in April 1943.|$|E

[...] Residente noted that the image represents Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States, {{in an attempt to}} both sanctify the immigrants and humanize the holy images common in Latin America. [...] An image inside the CD booklet features Residente with stigmata in his hands. [...] He noted that the photo is intended to portray Jesus as a [...] "regular guy" [...] who deals with struggles similar to those of people crossing borders. [...] He further commented, [...] "Obviously, [...] is not made for people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> seeing the guy with the chick in a bikini in a car with all her jewelry.

500|$|Murray {{plays an}} all-court game with an {{emphasis}} on defensive baseline play, and professional tennis coach Paul Annacone stated that Murray [...] "may be the best counterpuncher on tour today." [...] His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of Miloslav Mečíř. Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution while he primarily uses his forehand, which is more passive, and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his defensive game before playing more offensively. Tim Henman has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game, succeeding Lleyton Hewitt. Murray's tactics often involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the slow rally. Murray {{is also one of the}} top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined {{by the likes of}} Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced. It gets too lightweight." ...|$|E
