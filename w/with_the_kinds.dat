500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} from {{television}} critics were mostly mixed, who {{found it to be}} [...] "a thorough examination of both Miley Cyrus and the evil monkey in Chris' closet," [...] but, [...] "things got ridiculous." [...] Television critic Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, and called it a [...] "much better episode than Brian's Got a Brand New Bag, with some clever sight gags, an annoyingly catchy musical number, and the revelation of the Evil Monkey's true reasons for hiding in Chris' closet." [...] In a simultaneous review of all four MacFarlane programs, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C- stating, [...] "Turning Miley Cyrus into a Small Wonder parody was fitfully amusing, {{but the rest of the}} Hannah Montana material was ridiculously non-specific, filled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of jokes everyone made about Cyrus a few years ago." [...] VanDerWerff praised the action sequence at the end {{of the episode}}, however, calling it [...] "high quality stuff for the show." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated of the Evil Monkey's role in the episode, [...] "I don't think I ever wanted this character fully explored or seen by anyone else in the house [...] The character lost some of its mystique and charm." ...|$|E

6000|$|Earth-worms are {{distributed}} throughout the world under {{the form of a}} few genera, which externally are closely similar to one another. [...] The British species of Lumbricus have never been carefully monographed; but we may judge of their probable number from those inhabiting neighbouring countries. In Scandinavia there are eight species, according to Eisen; {7} but two of these rarely burrow in the ground, and one inhabits very wet places or even lives under the water. We are here concerned only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> which bring up earth to the surface in the form of castings. Hoffmeister says that the species in Germany are not well known, but gives the same number as Eisen, together with some strongly marked varieties. {8} ...|$|E

Pancreatic juice emulsifies fat, and we have just seen how greedily worms devour fat; it dissolves fibrin, and worms eat raw meat; it converts starch into grape-sugar with wonderful rapidity, and we shall presently show that the digestive fluid of worms acts on starch. {20} But they live chiefly on half-decayed leaves; and these would be useless to them unless they could digest the cellulose forming the cell-walls; for {{it is well known}} that all other nutritious substances are almost completely withdrawn from leaves, shortly before they fall off. It has, however, now been ascertained that some forms of cellulose, though very little or not at all attacked by the gastric secretion of the higher animals, are acted on by that from the pancreas. {21} ...|$|E
60|$|The {{advantages}} {{derived from}} cross-fertilisation throw {{a flood of}} light {{on most of the}} chief characters of flowers. We can thus understand their large size and bright colours, and in some cases the bright tints of the adjoining parts, such as the peduncles, bracteae, etc. By this means they are rendered conspicuous to insects, on the same principle that almost every fruit which is devoured by birds presents a strong contrast in colour with the green foliage, in order that it may be seen, and its seeds freely disseminated. With some flowers conspicuousness is gained at the expense even of the reproductive organs, as with the ray-florets of many Compositae, the exterior flowers of Hydrangea, and the terminal flowers of the Feather-hyacinth or Muscari. There is also reason to believe, and this was the opinion of Sprengel, that flowers differ in colour in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of insects which frequent them.|$|E
