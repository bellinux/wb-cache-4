25|$|This {{view was}} {{reinforced}} when surveys {{taken of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> after the failure were compared with those taken {{at the time it}} was built. They reveal that, in areas, the wall was 2 to 6 inches higher than when built.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the known}} {{height of the}} flood wave, and that within seventy minutes or less after the {{collapse}} the reservoir was virtually empty, the failure must have been sudden and complete. Seconds after it began, little {{of what had been}} the dam remained standing, other than the center section and <b>wing</b> <b>wall.</b> The main dam, from west of the center section to the <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> abutment atop the hillside, broke into several large pieces, and numerous smaller pieces. All of these were washed downstream as 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water began surging down San Francisquito Canyon. The largest piece, weighing 10,000 tons, (9,071,847kg) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1200m) below the dam site.|$|E
25|$|During the {{low water}} season of 1901, the Corps of Engineers {{proposed}} to spend $26,160 {{to extend the}} concrete <b>wing</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the head of}} the lock, regrade slopes, replace and extend riprap protection, and increase the stone filling at the base of the dam.|$|E

50|$|The {{soil and}} fill {{supporting}} the roadway and approach embankment are retained by the <b>wing</b> <b>walls,</b> {{which can be}} at a right angle to the abutment or splayed at different angles. The <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> are generally constructed {{at the same time}} and of the same materials as the abutments.|$|R
25|$|On {{the stone}} wall, (in {{the same way}} as Milecastles,) {{additional}} structures known as Wing Walls were incorporated on the east and west side, allowing bonding to the curtain wall. This is interpreted as evidence that turrets (and milecastles) were constructed before the curtain wall. Where turrets were built with the intention of bonding to a broad gauge curtain wall, they were given broad <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b> However, there are many cases where the curtain wall actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the curtain <b>wall</b> and turret <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> join. To facilitate bonding with the curtain <b>wall,</b> <b>wing</b> <b>walls</b> were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter <b>wing</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
