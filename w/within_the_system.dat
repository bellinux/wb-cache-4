5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance persisted 520miles (835km) south of Acapulco on July 3. It moved steadily westward and organized over warm water temperatures of 81°F (27°C). A circulation developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> and on July 9 it organized into Tropical Depression Seven while located about 580miles (930km) southwest of Acapulco. The depression {{turned to the}} west-northwest, and after briefly weakening it organized more to attain tropical storm status on July 10 while located about 745miles (1,200km) south of {{the southern tip of}} Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} trough, and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{development}} {{took place}} as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation while located west of Sonora. During the afternoon of September20, an {{area of low pressure}} developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> prompting the NHC to classify it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 240mi (390km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas.

40|$|Simulated {{lightning}} strike {{testing of the}} Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) field joint protection system heater assembly was performed at Thiokol Corp., Wendover Lightning Facility. Testing consisted of subjecting the lightning evaluation test article to simulated {{lightning strike}}s and evaluating the effects of heater cable transients on cables <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel. <b>The</b> maximum short circuit current coupled onto a United Space Boosters, Inc. operational flight cable <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel, induced by transients from all cables external to <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel, was 92 amperes. The maximum open-circuit voltage coupled was 316 volts. The maximum short circuit current coupled onto a United Space Boosters, Inc. operational flight cable <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel, induced by heater power cable transients only, was 2. 7 amperes; the maximum open-circuit voltage coupled was 39 volts. All heater power cable induced coupling was due to simulated lightning discharges only, no heater operating power was applied during the test. The results showed that, for a worst-case lightning discharge, the heater power cable is responsible for a 3. 9 decibel increase in voltage coupling to operational flight cables <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel. Testing also showed that current and voltage levels coupled onto cables <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel are partially dependant on the relative locations of <b>the</b> cables <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> tunnel...|$|R

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on June 3. It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean, and on June 15 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. The system continued westward, and late on June 16 a low pressure area developed about 300miles (480km) southwest of San José, Costa Rica. At around 1200UTC on June 17, Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance, though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized. The next day, however, an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Ships in the vicinity confirmed the development of a surface circulation <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> while satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast. Based on its organization, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E late on June 18 while located about 270miles (470km) southeast of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September 1. An {{area of low pressure}} {{associated with the}} wave moved slowly westward, and its convection initially appeared to become better organized. On September 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began early on September 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early on September 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection roughly 1,100km (700mi) east of Guam. A broad, low-level circulation center {{had formed}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and became increasingly organized, showing signs of developing convective banding. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was released later that day as convection was rapidly consolidating around the low, which was embedded within {{the eastern end of}} the monsoonal trough. It was then declared as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the JTWC with the latter designating it as Tropical Depression 15W The tropical depression was tracking westward along the southern edge of the subtropical ridge situated east of the international dateline.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2002, {{tropical}} {{activity was}} minimal {{in the southern}} Indian Ocean, limited to an area of convection, or thunderstorms, located southwest of Diego Garcia along the monsoon. On March4, a broad and elongated low pressure area developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> although moderate wind shear in the region initially prevented significant development. The next day, the circulation became better defined, and after being nearly stationary for a few days, it began moving steadily to the west-southwest, due to a ridge to the southeast.

At 0000UTC on March6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 18S, and six hours later MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Hary.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, a monsoon trough located {{west of the}} Northern Mariana Islands {{produced}} two tropical disturbances. The first of these tracked due west and later became Tropical Storm Irving.

By July21, an area of low pressure formed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and convection associated with it increased. Situated underneath an anticyclone, upper-level outflow also improved. Following further organization of the system, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 11W on July21; at this time, the depression was located about 555km (345mi) west of Guam. Further aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northwest, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July23 and was assigned the name Judy by the JTWC.|$|E

5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A small {{circulation}} formed {{north of}} the Cocos Islands on January8 within the near-equatorial trough. For about a week, it drifted west-southwestward without much development, although an area of convection formed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> on January11 about 1240km (770mi) southwest of Sumatra. Persistent wind shear prevented much strengthening, and the circulation crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on January16. Another increase in convection merited its classification as a tropical disturbance on the next day, which organized into a central dense overcast. Slow development continued, allowing the disturbance to become a tropical depression and later Tropical Storm Charly on January19. On the same day, the JTWC also began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 06S. Taking a track similar to earlier Tropical Cyclone Bindu, the storm moved southwestward around a ridge to the south. Charly gradually developed outflow and increasingly organized convection due to decreasing wind shear. A ragged eye formed on January20 and became better defined, and early on January21, Charly intensified into a tropical cyclone.|$|E
