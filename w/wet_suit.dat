25|$|The biggest {{drawback}} to using a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> is the {{chilling effect on}} the diver caused by the water evaporating from the suit after a dive. This can be reduced by using a heated shelter.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for an incapacitated person in the water to float face-down while wearing only a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> or a dry suit since they are not designed to serve as lifesaving devices in the normal understanding of that term.|$|E
25|$|The main {{components}} of the average scuba diver's equipment which are positively buoyant are the {{components of the}} exposure suit. The two most commonly used exposure suit types are the dry suit and the <b>wet</b> <b>suit.</b> Both of these types of exposure suit use gas spaces to provide insulation, and these gas spaces are inherently buoyant. The buoyancy of a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> will decrease significantly with an increase in depth as the ambient pressure causes the volume of the gas bubbles in the neoprene to decrease. A dry suit will also compress with depth, but the air space inside is continuous and can be topped up from a cylinder or vented to maintain a moderately constant volume. A large part of the ballast used by a diver is to balance the buoyancy of this gas space.|$|E

25|$|Dry {{suits are}} {{typically}} used {{where the water}} temperature is below 15°C (60°F), and for extended immersion in water above 15°C (60°F), where discomfort would be experienced by a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> user. They are also used with integral boots, and gloves and sealed to the helmet for personal protection when working in and around hazardous liquids.|$|E
25|$|A {{dry suit}} {{provides}} thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water, and normally protects {{the whole body}} except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15°C (60°F) or for extended immersion in water above 15°C (60°F), where a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> user would get cold, and with an integral helmet, boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|Dry suits pose {{their own}} unique {{problems}} compared to <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage and adjust the air volume inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, {{in order to prevent}} over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent. Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem when properly set.|$|E
50|$|Stand up paddlers wear {{a variety}} of <b>wet</b> <b>suits</b> and other clothing, {{depending}} on water and air temperature since {{most of their time}} is spent standing on the board.|$|R

25|$|Neoprene {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} a foam-rubber sheet {{containing}} tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can {{eliminate the need for}} an under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth {{in the same way as}} for a wetsuit. Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits. A neoprene <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any closed cell suit.|$|E
25|$|Upon arrival, the sheriff's deputies {{sealed off}} the spring with crime-scene tape. Ben's tanks, <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> and other diving {{equipment}} were not present {{and there were}} no signs of a struggle near his truck or anywhere else he could have been. His wallet, with almost $700 in cash, and cell phone were in the cab of his truck; dive logs showed that he had explored the cave and a map he made was also found. At the Santa Rosa Beach house officers found his dog, hungry from having been unfed for two days. Based on these circumstances, police and dive shop employees assumed that he had never resurfaced and had in all probability drowned somewhere in the cave trying to get out. Cadaver dogs alerted on the water surface, further supporting that theory.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{necessary}} to add gas to the BC, and it is always necessary to vent excess gas during a controlled ascent to maintain a suitable volume of gas in the BC during depth changes. Much the same must be done with the gas in a dry suit. When a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> is worn, the gas in the buoyancy compensator must also compensate for the volume changes of the suit to maintain neutral buoyancy. When gas is not added to the BC during a descent, the gas in the BC decreases in volume due to the increasing pressure, resulting in decreasing buoyancy with increased depth, until the diver hits the bottom. The same runaway phenomenon, an example of positive feedback, can happen during ascent if gas is not vented at a suitable rate, resulting in uncontrolled ascent, until a diver prematurely surfaces without a safety (decompression) stop.|$|E
25|$|Protection {{from heat}} loss {{in cold water}} is usually {{provided}} by <b>wet</b> <b>suits</b> or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits/diving skins may be sufficient.|$|R
25|$|The {{three goals}} of first aid for {{uncomplicated}} stings are to prevent injury to rescuers, deactivate the nematocysts, and remove tentacles {{attached to the}} patient. Rescuers usually wear barrier clothing, such as pantyhose, <b>wet</b> <b>suits</b> or full-body sting-proof suits while removing jellies or tentacles from injured. Deactivating the nematocysts (stinging cells) prevents further injection of venom.|$|R

25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a <b>wet</b> <b>suit,</b> and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E
500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn't think would ever float, they float. [...] Or then things that you hope would float actually sink and you can't find them anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The opera {{entered a}} wider {{repertory}} {{in the early}} 1970s, with performances in Vienna (1971) and Glyndebourne (1972). The Vienna performance used a new edition prepared by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whose subsequent partnership with the French opera director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle led to the staging of the opera in many European cities. Ponnelle's 1978 presentation in Edinburgh was later described as [...] "infamous"; at the time, critic Stanley Sadie praised the singers but criticised the production for its [...] "frivolity and indeed coarseness". In January 1974 Il ritorno received its United States première at Washington's Kennedy Center, {{on the basis of}} the Harnoncourt edition. More recently the opera has been performed at the New York Lincoln Center by New York City Opera, and at other venues throughout the United States. A 2006 Welsh National Opera production by David Alden, designed by Ian McNeil, featured neon signs, stuffed cats, a Neptune in flippers and a <b>wet</b> <b>suit,</b> Minerva in the form of the aviator Amelia Earhart, and Jupiter as a small-time hustler, an interpretation defended by the critic Anna Picard – [...] "the gods were always contemporary fantasies, while an abandoned wife and a humbled hero are eternals." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 5, 2007, an {{unidentified}} 10-year-old girl suffered severe internal injuries while riding the speed slide at the Denton, Texas park. The accident report {{filed by the}} on-duty lifeguards stated that the injuries were caused by the victim's failure to follow park rules, namely keeping her legs crossed at the ankles, while riding. [...] The park rule regarding crossing ankles on a water slide is common in the industry, and is one method (along with wearing a <b>wet</b> <b>suit)</b> used to prevent [...] "straddle injuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dry {{suits are}} used {{typically}} {{where the water}} temperature is between [...] Water is prevented from entering the suit by seals at the neck and wrists; also, the means of getting the suit on and off (typically a zipper) is waterproof. The suit insulates the wearer {{in one of two}} main ways: by maintaining an insulating layer of air in the undersuit between the body and the suit shell, (in exactly the way that thermal insulation garments work above water) or by using a watertight expanded neoprene suit shell, which is inherently insulating {{in the same way as}} a <b>wet</b> <b>suit,</b> and which can usually be worn with additional insulating undergarments.|$|E
2500|$|Hawk's {{figure is}} {{mentioned}} {{for a short}} period in the non fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra.

5000|$|Darlexx, {{a product}} of the Shawmut Corporation, is an {{omnidirectional}} warp knit fabric laminated to a monolithic film. It is a sports performance fabric used in gloves, boots, <b>wet</b> <b>suits,</b> ski apparel, clean rooms, and in medical applications. It was designed to keep a person [...] "warm when the environment is cold and cool when the environment is hot" [...] and is breathable, windproof, and waterproof.|$|R
2500|$|Neoprene {{is a type}} of {{synthetic}} rubber which can be foamed during manufacture to a high proportion of tiny enclosed gas bubbles, forming a buoyant and thermally-insulating material, called [...] "foamed neoprene", [...] "foam-neoprene" [...] or [...] "expanded neoprene". Wetsuits are made from this material as it is a good insulator, waterproof, and is flexible enough for comfortable wear. The neoprene alone is very flexible, but not very resistant to tearing, so it is skinned with a layer of knit fabric bonded to each side for strength and abrasion resistance. Foamed neoprene may be used for the shell of a drysuit, providing some insulation due to the gas within the material, as in a standard wetsuit. If torn or punctured, leading to flooding, a foam-neoprene suit retains the insulation and buoyancy of the gas bubbles, like a <b>wet</b> <b>suit,</b> which is proportional to the thickness of the foam, Although foamed-neoprene dry suits provide some insulation, thermal under-suits are usually worn in cold water.|$|E
60|$|But for {{the thought}} of her father she would have fallen asleep, in her drenched tweeds. When she did force the energy to rise, she had to support herself by the bureau, by the foot of the bed, as she moved about the room, hanging up the <b>wet</b> <b>suit,</b> rubbing herself with a {{slippery}} towel, putting on a dark silk frock and pumps. She found her father sitting motionless in his room, staring at the wall. She made herself laugh at him for his gloomy emptiness. She paraded down the hall with him.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, smiled, and {{simulated}} {{a prodigious}} effort at filling her lungs to their utmost capacity. Graham watched enchanted. A diver himself, he had rarely seen the turn {{and a half}} attempted by women other than professionals. Her <b>wet</b> <b>suit</b> of light blue and green silk clung closely to her, showing the lines of her justly proportioned body. With {{what appeared to be}} an agonized gulp for the last cubic inch of air her lungs could contain, she sprang up, out, and down, her body vertical and stiff, her legs straight, her feet close together as they impacted on the springboard end. Flung into the air by the board, she doubled her body into a ball, made a complete revolution, then straightened out in perfect diver's form, and in a perfect dive, with scarcely a ripple, entered the water.|$|E
