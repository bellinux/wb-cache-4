[...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1996, the Indians again {{had the best}} record in baseball (9962) and Lofton's stolen base total (75) led the MLB {{for the second time in}} four years. He hit [...]317 and had a career-high 67 RBIs. The Indians lost in the 1996 ALDS to the Baltimore Orioles in four games. As an impending free agent, it was Lofton's last season with Cleveland before being traded to near the end of spring training 1997 to the Atlanta Braves of the National League. On trading Lofton, Hart said, [...] "We had to make this trade and based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end of this season. We went through it with Albert Belle last year, and Albert left and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> in return. We were not prepared to do that again." [...] Lofton, described as [...] "an emotional and offensive catalyst" [...] with the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star Games (19941996) and won four straight Gold Glove Awards (19931996) with the Indians. He led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (19921996) and set the single-season Indians' franchise stolen base record (75).|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to say. I was dying of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E
500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you have nothing to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{the punk}} style was popular among people aged 18–22. Characterized by multi-colored mohawks, ripped skinny jeans, worn band tee-shirts, and denim or leather jackets. This style was popular {{among people who}} listened to punk music such as The Sex Pistols, and later, (despite the band's self-proclaimed rock'n'roll image) Guns N' Roses. Usually the denim jackets (which became an {{identity}} of the group) were adorned by safety pins, buttons, patches, and several other pieces of music or cultural memorabilia. Oftentimes, fans of the punk style would take random bits of fabric and attach them to their other clothes with safety pins. This soon became a popular way of attaching clothing, {{and it is now}} known as [...] "pin shirts" [...] with young women. The shirts are, essentially, rectangular pieces of fabric that are pinned on one side with safety pins. In the 1980s, a dressed down look (e.g. buzzed hair, T-shirts, jeans and button up shirts) was also very popular with people involved in punk rock, more specifically the hardcore punk scene. The Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris said [...] "Some of those punk rock kids they interviewed were a little over the top, but the thing historically is – the L.A./Hollywood punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with that. Black flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop." [...] Punk dress was not simply a fashion statement. It epitomized a way of thinking and seeing oneself as an individual cultural producer and consumer. In this way, punk style led many people to ask further questions about their culture and their politics.|$|E
2500|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. [...] He anchored off {{the west coast of}} the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew was initially welcomed and treated with honor. He and his men were given much food, various gifts from the islands inhabitants. They were shown traditional native performances and ceremonies, and generally treated as privileged guests, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity Lono. However, after he and the crews of both ships, [...] and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only american aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only citizen aboard the ship not loyal to the crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed, neutral account of the events in his journals [...] During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter and forcibly stole the wood used to border the natives sacred [...] "Morai" [...] burial ground, used for high ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals, Cook offered two iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "The poor dismayed chief's dreading his (Cook's) displeasure, which they saw approaching followed him upon the Morai to behold the fence that enclosed the mansions of their noble ancestors, and the images of their gods torn to pieces by a handful of rude strangers without the power, or at least without the resolution of opposing their sacrilegious depredations. When Cook had ascended the Morai he once more offered the hatchets to the chiefs. It was a very unequal price if the honest chiefs would have accepted of the bribe and Cook offered it only to evade the imputation of taking their property without payment." [...] [...] John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain friend of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. John Ledyard goes on to say in his journal: [...] "On the evening of the (January) 15th we struck our tents, and everything was taken on board, and it was very manifestly much to the satisfaction of the natives. A little after dark an old house that stood {{on the corner of the}} Morai took fire and burned down. This we supposed was occasioned by our people carelessly leaving their fire near it, but it was not the case. The natives burnt it themselves to show us the resentment they now entertained towards us, on account of our using it without their consent, and indeed manifestly against their consent. We had made a sail loft of one part of it, and a hospital for our sick for the other part, though it was evidently esteemed by the natives as holy as the rest of the Morai, and ought to have been considered by us." [...] On the 6th of February Cook's ships unmoored and left Kealakekua bay. They were met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On February 11th, the Resolution again entered Kealakekua bay on the night of 13 February. [...] Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance.....It was also equally evident from the looks of the natives as well as every other appearance that our friendship was at an end, and that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do but to hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of being wondered at..." [...] While anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of only two long boats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to force good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii,Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of mistakes. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians mistaking the explorer for their own deity.|$|E
