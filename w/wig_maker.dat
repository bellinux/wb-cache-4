Although willing to credit Moore and Gair with the rebirth of bodypainting in a San Francisco Chronicle story, the [...] "makeup artist, <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> and stylist" [...] Jim Ponder had difficulty calling interest in bodypainting a trend because it traces back to the [...] "beginnings of man." [...] Joanne Gair has described the painting as a stylized reference to Botticelli, since the sinuous pose {{is reminiscent of the}} central figures in both Primavera and The Birth of Venus. The Amazon.com product description for Gair's book calls her participation in this photoshoot as her [...] "defining moment." [...] Soon after the release of the magazine Gair became such a pop culture icon that she was considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign according to a story in The New York Times. The work is considered to be an example from the most sophisticated end of the bodypainting spectrum which extends all the way to Henna tattoos.|$|E
2500|$|Until the mid-15th century, {{the south}} side of the square was lined with wooden shops, in the spacious basements of which peasants kept their {{provisions}} and prepared meals. [...] Among the numerous historical tenants in the building was adventurer Filip Kern from Meissen, Saxony. [...] He served as a barber and a master builder for King John III and is suspected to have poisoned King Eric XIV. [...] During the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, the Dutch merchant Abraham Cabiljau, one of the founders and first mayors of Gothenburg, lived in the building. [...] The French <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> Jean Bedoire bought the building in 1682 and, just like his son and namesake who gave his name to the alley Bedoirsgränd, made a fortune in trading wine, salt, and iron. [...] The building was completely rebuilt in 1937 when the façades of the three buildings located south of the square were united to form the present façade. [...] Occupying the three buildings in the block since 1944 is the Mäster Olofsgården ("Homestead of Master Olof"). [...] It was founded as a youth centre by the priest Gabriel Grefberg in 1931 when Gamla stan was mostly a slum, and the number of activities quickly grew to include elderly, mothers, scouts, workers, and many other groups. [...] Following a generous donation, the organisation was able to gather its activities to the present location in 1944. [...] Today its services include studies in the history of the old town and the [...] "Gamla stan Society" [...] (Gamla stan sällskapet). [...] The cannonball in the corner of Skomakargatan, according to popular legend, dates back to the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520, when it was fired at the Danish king Christian Tyrant. [...] Undoubtedly, it was more likely built into the wall by an early proprietor and subsequently put back into place after each restoration. [...] The restaurant on the ground floor, Stortorgskällaren, is built over a medieval basement, part of which dates back to the 15th century. [...] According to some sources, this was the location for the tavern Spanska druvan ("The Spanish Grape"), the oldest known tavern in Stockholm, which was (according to tradition) frequented by King John III when he wanted to mingle with commoners.|$|E

50|$|The {{information}} {{known for}} the price of a (gentleman's) wig or perruque, varied from 12 livres for the cheapest one, to 35 livres for the most expensive one. It has been estimated that in the 1200 wig making and hairdressing shops worked some 10 000 employees or journeymen (garçons), usually 15 hours a day. In 1780's there were some 900 master <b>wig</b> <b>makers</b> in Paris.|$|R

50|$|Although hair jewelry existed {{prior to}} the Victorian era, it was this period that saw it {{flourish}} as a trade and private craft in Mourning Jewelry. The Victorian Period saw a rise in mourning practices due to its popularity through Queen Victoria, and wearing hair jewelry {{was seen as a}} form of carrying one's sentiments for the deceased. Unlike many other natural materials, human hair does not decay with the passing of time. Hair has chemical qualities that cause it to last for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. Additionally, by the 19th century many hair artists and <b>wig</b> <b>makers</b> had too little employment after the powdered wigs, often worn by noblemen of the 17th and 18th centuries, went out of fashion. The period of sentimentality, characteristic of the Victorian era, offered these craftsmen a new opportunity to earn their income working with hair. Early hair jewelry was usually made for the higher classes in cooperation with goldsmiths, producing beautiful and expensive creations of hair mounted in gold and often decorated with pearls or precious stones. Pieces constructed with precious materials by artisans were naturally very expensive and it wasn't until the middle of the Victorian period, when instructional guides became available, that hair jewelry became popular with the lower classes.|$|R
50|$|The damage for the French {{army was}} immediate. Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his position to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the northwest. The French had been notorious on their march across Germany, disorganized by persistent pillaging, and were completely undisciplined. In addition, Soubise's army had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, <b>wig</b> <b>makers,</b> barbers, mistresses, pastry chefs, grooms and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the advanced post, commanded the rear guard that struggled {{to keep up with the}} fleeing army; the Count complained that the troops in his charge had been defective. He claimed that he was leading a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.|$|R

By the age of fourteen, he was working at Korpo, a Moscow <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> and cosmetician to the Imperial Russian Grand Opera. He spent the years from eighteen to twenty-two undertaking his compulsory military service in the Imperial Russian Army, where he served in the Hospital Corps.|$|E
50|$|Orders {{go out to}} pick up Nina’s ex-husband and Lombardi and the Commissioner follows up a wig lead Digberry gave him, about {{gray hair}} found from an {{inferior}} wig to the kind Digberry makes. The <b>wig</b> <b>maker,</b> Wilkins tells him it could be from a wig he made for Galloway or for Lombardi. Captain Walters (Captain because he served in France in WWI) who managed Nina, offers a thousand dollar reward for the capture of her murderer. A report is given that Lombardi is {{out of town and}} no such person as Galloway or the address given the <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> exists.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera pans}} through the dark, {{dilapidated}} city filled with death. The <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> {{focuses on a}} newly orphaned girl with striking red hair who lives across the street. He watches her mother’s corpse get tossed to the body collectors and the girl succumb to the plague herself. The night before she dies, the girl’s spirit visits the periwig maker and informs him of her imminent death. After her death, {{he goes to the}} mass grave and retrieves her red hair to make a wig from it. In the final scene, the <b>wig</b> <b>maker</b> lies in bed, wearing the red wig, describing the reconstruction of London after the dissipation of the plague.|$|E
50|$|Anthony Hope {{falls in}} love with her at first sight and vows to rescue her from her containment. Judge Turpin discovers her plot to escape and sends her to Fogg's Asylum for the mentally deranged. She is rescued by Anthony, posing as a <b>wig</b> <b>maker's</b> apprentice. During the escape, she is forced to kill Fogg, the Asylum owner, when Anthony cannot bring himself to. Disguised as a sailor, she is taken to Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where he has been longing to see her. When an insane beggar woman (later {{revealed}} to be her mother) pursues her in the upper room, Johanna hides herself in a large trunk. From there she presumably witnesses Todd's murders of the Beggar Woman and the Judge. She is nearly murdered by her father when he discovers her, as he does not recognize her as his daughter (being as he had never met her since infancy and because she is disguised as a young man). She survives when Mrs. Lovett screams in the basement bakehouse, distracting Todd and allowing her to escape. In the final scene, Johanna, Anthony and two policemen encounter Toby in the bakehouse, mindlessly turning the meat grinder, surrounded by the corpses of Todd, Lucy, Mrs. Lovett, and Turpin. Presumably she elopes with Anthony after the events of the show.|$|R

5000|$|Germanisms {{in foreign}} {{languages}} {{may have gone}} through a change of meaning, appearing as false friend to the learned's eye. For instance, in Russian галстук galstuk is not a scarf (German literally: [...] "Halstuch"), but a tie, even though the modern German equivalent [...] "Krawatte" [...] (Croatian neck tie) seems to be of a more recent date; nor would a парикмахер parikmacher (German literally: [...] "Perückenmacher") be a [...] "wig-maker", but actually is a hairdresser. It seems, though, that the hair dresser was indeed called a <b>wig</b> <b>maker,</b> i.e. when wigs were in fashion {{and that was what}} they did. Thus both Italians (parrucchiere) and Spaniards (peluquero) still call all hair dressers, for gentlemen and ladies, wig makers.|$|E
