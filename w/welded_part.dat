40|$|Most {{manufacturing}} processes, including welding, create residual stresses. Residual stresses {{can reduce}} material strength and cause fractures. For estimating {{the reliability and}} aging of a welded structure, residual stresses should be evaluated as precisely as possible. Optical techniques such as holographic interferometry, electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), Moire interferometry, and shearography are noncontact means of measuring residual stresses. Among optical techniques, ESPI is typically used as a nondestructive measurement technique of in-plane displacement, such as stress and strain, and out-of-plane displacement, such as vibration and bending. In this study, ESPI {{was used to measure}} the residual stress on the <b>welded</b> <b>part</b> of butt-welded American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A 36 specimens with CO 2 welding. Four types of specimens, base metal specimen (BSP), tensile specimen including <b>welded</b> <b>part</b> (TSP), compression specimen including <b>welded</b> <b>part</b> (CSP), and annealed tensile specimen including <b>welded</b> <b>part</b> (ATSP), were tested.
