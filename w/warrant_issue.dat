While {{investors can}} write stock options on the ASX (or CBOE), {{they are not}} permitted to do so with ASX-listed warrants, since only companies can issue warrants and, while each option contract is over 1000 underlying ordinary shares (100 on CBOE), the number of warrants that must be exercised by the holder to buy the underlying asset depends on the conversion ratio set out in the offer documentation for the <b>warrant</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} mapping current {{situation}} {{on the market in}} warrants as nonstandardised option contracts. Particular attention is paid to the special issues of warrants modified into the form of so called "access products". The function of such financial instrument is to open extraordinary investment opportunity to certain kind of investors, who otherwise are not allowed to make direct investment into the underlying asset itself. Access products can be considered as particular financial innovation, which spread out on Central European capital markets. The most familiar form of access products are low strike price covered call warrants, the characteristics of which are being analyzed and compared to standard options and warrants. The author also focuses on the process of issuing warrant securities on Czech capital market according to Czech law and problems linked to it, which the issuer encounters. The thesis proves on the example of Fondul Proprietatea Warrants, which were in 2010 successfully placed to third market of Vienna Stock Exchange by Czech entity, that such <b>warrant</b> <b>issue</b> is possible despite of material complications stemming from the absence of clear definition of warrants in Czech law...|$|E
