5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension,</b> supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
25|$|ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), {{a method}} of {{controlling}} air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was {{also a part of}} the 7M-GE's technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear. A targa top was offered in all years along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in '91).|$|E
25|$|Fully {{independent}} double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was employed}} at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the suspension shock absorber components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the coil spring and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic profile around the car's nose-cone. Braking was by outboard-mounted, Dunlop disc brakes all round.|$|E
50|$|RevoKnuckle is Ford's {{variation}} of the MacPherson strut suspension design which separates steering and suspension movements to provide lower scrub radius ref1 and kingpin offset than traditional MacPherson struts. Ford claims that it weighs less and costs less than double <b>wishbone</b> and multi-link <b>suspension</b> arrangement. The kingpin offset compares favorably to that of double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspensions</b> (20-30mm vs 40mm).The main advantage of RevoKnuckle compared to MacPherson struts is the reduction in torque steer, especially for high powered FWD applications.|$|R
50|$|Beside the lightness, “fun handling” is {{the other}} design {{philosophy}} of HU-GO. For that reason, double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspensions</b> are implemented for both axles as in the sport cars. HU-GO has a total power of 17 hp produced by two separate electric motors. This power brings HU-GO to a maximum speed of 100 km/h. HU-GO can accelerate 0 to 50 km/h in 5 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension - The X model {{comes with}} double <b>wishbone</b> type, {{independent}} <b>suspension</b> {{on the rear}} of the car. All other models come with self-levelling double <b>wishbone</b> type, independent <b>suspension</b> on the rear.|$|R
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all {{contemporary}} Formula One designs, the FW30's basic architecture {{is built around}} a carbon fibre, aramid and honeycomb composite material monocoque. The design carries over the FW29's zero keel, double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> arrangement, along with the twin-pillar rear wing. The FW30's front wing is one {{area in which the}} design of the FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the tip of the car's, slightly lower, nose cone. However, unlike the McLaren, the FW30's front wing is suspended from the nose cone using the forward element.|$|E
25|$|The Terrex AV81 is an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8×8 {{wheeled chassis}} and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It {{is designed to}} be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension,</b> which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side {{at the back of the}} hull propel the vehicle through water at 10km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} the T43 design {{was replaced by}} the Mark III version of the [...] "Formula Two" [...] chassis. Maddock and the Coopers upgraded the existing design by switching the front suspension for an improved double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension</b> arrangement with coilover shock absorbers, in place of the older cars' transverse leaf spring design. New step-up gears in the transaxle allowed Maddock to lower the engine (now including Climax's stretched [...] FPF in the works Formula One car), reducing the centre of gravity of the new Cooper T45 (Mark III) by mounting the dry-sump engine much lower. Maddock credited this particular innovation to Jack Brabham, who received the suggestion from his Australian friend, Ron Tauranac. Brabham and Cooper contributed other detail improvements, but Maddock left the fundamental chassis frame virtually unaltered from the T43. The T45 was immediately successful. In the hands of Maurice Trintignant, Rob Walker's new T45 won the very next World Championship round, the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E
2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspension.</b> Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E

50|$|In {{cars with}} double <b>wishbone</b> <b>suspensions,</b> camber angle may be fixed or adjustable, but in MacPherson strut suspensions, it is {{normally}} fixed. The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, {{but if the}} car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the upper control arm or strut mounting points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber adjustment. Aftermarket plates with slots for strut mounts instead of just holes are available {{for most of the}} commonly modified models of cars.|$|R
