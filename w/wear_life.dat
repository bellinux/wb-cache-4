When the captain inquired about the rescue, the VTS replied that patrol boats were due to arrive in 10 minutes and a helicopter in one minute. The captain then replied that there were too many passengers for the helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Rafting is {{very popular}} in Lehigh Gorge State Park. The Lehigh River is rated a Class III river on the International Scale of River Difficulty, {{although}} this depends on the water conditions, which are generally best in the spring. The conditions are controlled {{by the amount of}} rainfall in the area and by the amount of water released from the Francis E. Walter Dam at White Haven by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. All boaters must <b>wear</b> <b>life</b> jackets that are in compliance with the rules and regulations of the United States Coast Guard. Several licensed commercial outfitters currently operate on the Lehigh River. This first white water rafting outfitter to operate on the Lehigh River was , founded in 1975.|$|E
25|$|A plane {{en route}} to the island airport crashed in Lake Ontario in January 1987, during snow squalls. The plane sank, leaving its two {{occupants}} floating in the lake <b>wear</b> <b>life</b> jackets for an hour before rescue. The pilot died due to hypothermia, while the passenger survived. A crash inquiry was held into the circumstances of the crash. It was found that the rescue of the two occupants of the plane was delayed by communications problems in the notifications of appropriate search-and-rescue authorities. It also found, according to the airport's fire chief, that the island did not have enough fire equipment to put out a fire if a Dash 8 crashed. The revelation about the fire equipment prompted a debate at Toronto City Council about possibly closing the airport over safety concerns. Council had been assured that the airport was safe a year earlier, when the agreement to allow the Dash 8 was made with the city. The Government of Canada admitted that the island airport did not have enough fire equipment and fire-retardant foam. It only carried 650 litres of foam, when 5,500 litres was required according to the types of planes and numbers of flights occurring at the airport. The Government of Canada purchased a 6,700 litre capacity Walter 6000 firetruck and it was put into service in November 1987. 1987 saw an increase in takeoffs and landings at the airport, from 182,215 to 198,072.|$|E

Gordon Van Kleeck, a private in Company F of the U.S. 51st Pioneer Infantry, one of the units aboard Kroonland on this trip, recorded his day-to-day activities in a journal. He stated that the soldiers wore overalls rather than uniforms, and were required to <b>wear</b> <b>life</b> jackets at all times. During the early mornings, the most dangerous time for submarines according to Van Kleeck, the soldiers had to stand by their life rafts until the sun was completely up. Bathing facilities were too small, so {{several times during the}} trip the soldiers gathered on deck for salt water baths, which consisted of a hose turned on them by the ship's crew. On 2 August, Finland developed engine trouble and fell back from the convoy, but by the next day, she and a destroyer that stayed with her had rejoined the convoy. The convoy arrived in Brest on 7 August, and Kroonland arrived back in the United States on 19 August.|$|E

2500|$|Whitewater boating is {{very popular}} on this part of Slippery Rock Creek and it is rated a Class II-III, on the International Scale of River Difficulty, {{depending}} on water conditions.

It may be, but often it is a mere greed of fame, fear of shame, or lust of plunder. No, it is the spirit that gives itself for others--the temper that for the sake of religion, of country, of duty, of kindred, nay, of pity even to a stranger, will dare all things, risk all things, endure all things, meet death in one moment, or <b>wear</b> <b>life</b> away in slow, persevering tendance and suffering.|$|E

To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels.
