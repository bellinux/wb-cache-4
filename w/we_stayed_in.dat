500|$|The war in Europe had cast grave {{doubt on}} the Air Corps' {{doctrine}} that fighters could not shoot down bombers and the bomber will always get through. In the Battle of Britain the British Royal Air Force had demonstrated that it could shoot down bombers, while its own bomber force had suffered such heavy losses over Germany that it had abandoned daylight bombing in favor of night raids. Nonetheless, the planners held firm in their belief that, since American bombers were better armed and armored than their British or German counterparts, the bombers would get through, even in daylight, and that enemy fighter strength could be destroyed on the ground by bombing airbases and factories. [...] "Each of us," [...] Kuter wrote years later, [...] "scoffed {{at the idea that}} fighters would be needed to protect bombers, to enable bombers to reach their objective. In preparing AWPD-l, <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> that rut." [...] Walker was promoted to colonel on 1 February 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Froome was {{introduced}} to the British-based, South African-backed, second-tier UCI Professional Continental team, , by South African Robbie Hunter, signing with them for the 2008 season. In March he finished second overall in the Giro del Capo in South Africa, one minute and forty-one seconds behind his teammate, Christian Pfannberger. Over April and March, he rode the Critérium International, Gent-Wevelgem and the Ardennes classics. He made his Grand Tour debut when he was named in 's squad for the Tour de France– becoming Kenya's first participant, in which he finished 84th overall and 11th among the young rider classification. In October Froome finished fourth overall in the Herald Sun Tour in Victoria, Australia. His performances in 2008 attracted the attention of British Cycling coach, Rod Ellingworth, who believed Froome had potential. Froome said: [...] "Although I was riding under the Kenyan flag I made it clear that I had always carried a British passport and felt British. It was then we talked about racing under the Union Flag, and <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> touch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boesch was a {{physical}} training fanatic whose dog tag listed [...] "PT" [...] as his religion and who through the decades {{gained a reputation}} for leading grueling runs that men would {{look for ways to}} get out of by faking injuries or hiding in bushes. [...] In former SEAL James Watson's 1995 memoir Point Man, he states of 1964 training that, [...] "We had to be physically fit to perform what was expected of us. And for all our trying , Rudy Boesch made sure that <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> condition." [...] Kevin Dockery's 2003 work Navy Seals: A History Part III – Post-Vietnam to the Present includes three different SEALs relating how, when Boesch was 50 to 57 years old, he could keep up with or surpass trainees less than half his age in five-mile runs, obstacle courses, and open sea swimming. [...] In his 2011 memoir, SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper, former SEAL Howard E. Wasdin tells of being assigned to SEAL Team TWO in the late 1980s, where Boesch, though nearly 60 years old, nevertheless ran with the trainees over an obstacle course; he then made every person who finished behind him run it again. [...] Even Boesch's physical appearance made a mark: [...] Wasdin refers to him as an exemplar of military form, Wasdin describes him as having [...] "a perfect crew cut", another account talks of his haircut and uniform being perfect at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, and in 2002's One Perfect Op, former SEAL Dennis Chalker said that among SEALs based on the U.S. East Coast in the late 1970s, the style was known as a [...] "Rudy Boesch haircut" [...] and was even more severe than normal military cuts.|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} once so fragile and so devoted {{that on the}} spur of the moment I relented, and <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Venice four more days.|$|E

60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> {{the kitchen}} and saw the whole {{delightful}} process, from the first mixing of the yellow meal with water, and the first cut into the round pumpkins, until the swelling pudding and the tranquil pie emerged in hot and savory grandeur from the oven.|$|E

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Glasgow one day, and Jone {{was delighted}} with it, {{because he said}} it was like an American city.

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said Jack, {{breaking}} silence {{at the end}} of a long pause which had succeeded an animated discussion as to whether it were better to spend one's life in the civilised world or among the wilds of Africa, in which discussion Peterkin, who advocated the wild life, was utterly, though not admittedly, beaten--"it seems to me that, notwithstanding the short time <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> the gorilla country, we have been pretty successful.

6000|$|As we didn't {{go to the}} Abbey, and was so long {{making up}} our minds where we should go, it got too late to go anywhere, and so <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> the hotel and looked out into a lonely and deserted street, with the wind blowing the little leaves and straws against the tight-shut doors of the forsaken houses.

60|$|I judged {{we could}} get diplomas, now, anyhow; so we went after them, but the Chief Guide put us off, with one pretext or another, during all the time <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Chamonix, and we ended by never getting them at all. So much for his {{prejudice}} against people's nationality. However, we worried him {{enough to make him}} remember us and our ascent for some time. He even said, once, that he wished there was a lunatic asylum in Chamonix. This shows that he really had fears {{that we were going to}} drive him mad. It was what we intended to do, but lack of time defeated it.|$|E
6000|$|We said, {{during summer}} days at Venice, when every campo was a furnace seven times heated, and every canal {{was filled with}} boiling bathers, [...] "As soon as it rains {{we will go to}} Arquà." [...] Remembering the ardors of an April sun on the long, level roads of plain, we could not think of them in August without a sense of dust {{clogging}} every pore, and eyes that shrank from the vision of their blinding whiteness. So <b>we</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Venice, waiting for rain, until the summer had almost lapsed into autumn; and as the weather cooled before any rain reached us, we took the moisture on the main-land for granted, and set out under a cloudy and windy sky.|$|E

"To be sure, I {{had much}} rather she had <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> harbour, that I might have sat {{a few hours}} with you in comfort; but {{as there is a}} boat ashore, I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it.

6000|$|... 'Not that either. I {{have moved}} in one matter without {{consulting}} thee.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> Fossombrone {{little more}} than a half-hour, and having made a hasty supper we resumed our way, giving out that we wished to reach Fano ere we slept. And so by the first hour of night Fossombrone was a league or so behind us, and we were {{advancing}} briskly towards the sea. Overhead a moon rode at the full in a clear sky, and its light was reflected by the snow, so that we were not discomforted by any darkness. We fell, presently, into a gentler pace, for, after all, there could be no advantage in reaching Pesaro before morning, and as we rode we talked, and I made bold to ask her the cause of her flight from Rome.|$|E

But even if I had seen him there, what use would it have been? Would I have tried to repair the wrong done?

6000|$|The fifth night below St. Louis {{we had a}} big storm after midnight, with a {{power of}} thunder and {{lightning}}, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. <b>We</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.

[...] It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.|$|E
5000|$|Jungians however have perhaps {{been most}} {{explicit}} about the 'need to accord space, {{time and place}} for liminal feeling' - as well about the associated dangers, 'two mistakes: we provide no ritual space at all <b>in</b> our lives...or <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> it too long'.
