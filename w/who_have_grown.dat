25|$|Lead {{smelters}} {{contribute to}} several environmental problems, especially raised blood lead levels {{in some of}} the town population. The problem is particularly significant in many children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up in the area. There is a government project to address this. Nyrstar plans to progressively reduce lead in blood levels such that ultimately 95% of all children meet the national goal of 10 micrograms per decilitre. This has been known as the tenby10 project. Community lead in blood levels in children are now at less than half the level that they were in the mid 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Vang {{emigrated to}} the United States after the communists seized power in Laos in 1975. He and his wife, May Song Vang, whom he married in 1973, {{initially}} moved first to Montana before settling in California. He remained widely respected by his fellow Hmong and was an esteemed elder of the American Hmong people, many of whom experienced the war or the reprisals that followed. Though he was somewhat less influential among younger Hmong-Americans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up primarily in the United States, he generally was considered an influential leader of U.S.-based Hmong, enjoying great loyalty for his position of leadership and respect for his military accomplishments.|$|E
25|$|During the FFA's {{administration}} of the club, they indicated an openness to changes to the Perth Glory name and colours. Even though this move was welcomed by many long time supporters who remember the original motives of the Nick Tana led consortium in the mid 1990s to purchase the naming and livery rights and all other historical assets related to the oldest (albeit with a non-continuous history) Western Australian football club, Perth City FC, resulting in being rebuffed at the final minute, this was still not a popular move amongst the bulk of paid-up Perth Glory members <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> accustomed to the current name and colours thus closing the door on any popular compromise. Thankfully for said members, the new ownership triumvirate consisting of Messrs Sage, Spence and McKeon stated that the colours will certainly not be changed under their reign.|$|E
25|$|Sweden emerged unharmed by World War II. The Swedish {{non-alignment}} policy officially remained – Sweden rejected NATO membership but {{joined the}} United Nations and later EFTA. Tage Erlander (s) was Prime Minister from 1946 to 1969 – {{a period of}} exceptional economic and social prosperity, and generally low unemployment, but the housing situation posed problems {{as more and more}} people moved to the cities. Responding to the housing shortage, the government introduced the Million Programme – a national wave of suburban development with the aim of creating a million homes from 1965 to 1974. This period saw the beginning of large-scale immigration to a country that used {{to be one of the}} more ethnically homogeneous in the world. The first phase of immigration consisted of workers from southern Europe, who were actively wooed over by campaigns of advertisement and recruitment in their home countries, for instance Italy & Austria. In the 1970s and 1980s many refugees with families arrived from e.g. Chile, Kurdistan, Vietnam & Somalia, some of them with refugee status, others on the immigration quota. At the same time, the economy was entering less powerfully prosperous times: while Sweden continues to be a thoroughly industrialized nation with many businesses of cutting-edge innovation, especially in telephonics, energy management, chemicals, pharmaceutics & food industry, this growth both in production and complication is not generating a great amount of new employment in Sweden anymore, and therefore did not swallow the generations <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up since 1980.|$|E

500|$|In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed Jacob Marley in a BBC {{television}} {{adaptation of}} A Christmas Carol, which starred Michael Hordern as Ebenezer Scrooge; Sergio Angelini, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute about Le Mesurier's portrayal, considered that [...] "although never frightening, he does exert {{a strong sense of}} melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse". In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in Walt Disney's Unidentified Flying Oddball, directed by Russ Mayberry, and co-starring Dennis Dugan, Jim Dale and Kenneth More. The film, an adaptation of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, was hailed by Time Out as [...] "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" [...] and cited it as [...] "one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon". The reviewers praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More's Arthur and Le Mesurier's Gawain, which they said were [...] "rather touchingly portrayed as friends <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> old together".|$|E
500|$|This episode saw The Simpsons surpass The Flintstones for {{the number}} of episodes {{produced}} for an animated series. The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show [...] "fresh" [...] again. The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as [...] "jumping the shark", instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or major plot twist to boost ratings. The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character, when the show has run for too long. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involve children, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up. This was the case in [...] "Oliver" [...] in The Brady Bunch or [...] "Luke" [...] on Growing Pains. Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this, by attempting to keep The Itchy and Scratchy Show and the Simpson family fresh respectively.|$|E
500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging for people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, {{the concept of the}} music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that gets to be big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Paul and Virginia are two young lovers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> up together from babyhood. Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on {{an island in the}} Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her." ...|$|E

But to anyone living before 1918, {{the title of the}} Great War was applied to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815." [...] In 1911, the historian John Holland Rose published a book titled William Pitt and the Great War.|$|E
