5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist {{who had been working}} to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E

25|$|At the time, Roy {{told the}} media that despite {{allowing}} five goals on 17 shots in the first, Tremblay kept him in net in order to humiliate him.

25|$|In 1972, American {{entomologist}} William Buren described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new species, naming it Solenopsis invicta. Buren {{collected a}} holotype worker from Cuiabá in Mato Grosso, Brazil, {{and provided the}} first official description of the ant in a journal article published by the Georgia Entomological Society. He accidentally misspelled invicta as invica above the description pages of the species, although {{it was clear that}} invicta was the intended spelling because of the constant use of the name in the article. The type material is currently housed in the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|On November 26, 2010, the Square was {{the site}} of an {{attempted}} car bombing. Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American student, was arrested after attempting to set off <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. It turned out the bomb was inert and was part of an FBI sting operation. He was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. In October 2014, Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison along with credit for time served since his arrest, as well as lifetime supervision upon his scheduled release in 2037.|$|E

50|$|One {{particularly}} bloody {{battle on}} Bloody Nose {{came when the}} 1st Battalion, 1st Marines—under the command of Major Raymond Davis—attacked Hill 100. Over six days of fighting, the battalion suffered 71% casualties. Captain Everett Pope and his company penetrated deep into the ridges, leading his remaining 90 men to seize <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> Hill 100. It took a day's fighting to reach <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> {{the crest of the}} hill, which was in fact another ridge, occupied by more Japanese defenders.|$|R
25|$|Allen Crum, a 40-year-old retired Air Force tail gunner, was {{a manager}} at the University Book Store Co-Op. Across the street he saw a 17-year-old {{newspaper}} boy being dragged and went to break up <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fight. Learning the boy had been shot, and hearing more shots, Crum rerouted street traffic out of harm's way. Unable {{to make his way}} back to the store safely, he then made his way to the tower, where he offered to help the police. Inside the tower, he accompanied Department of Public Safety Agent Dub Cowan and Austin Police Officer Jerry Day up the elevator; Cowan provided Crum with a rifle.|$|E
25|$|While {{serving his}} {{sentence}} {{he wrote his}} autobiography awaiting a new trial at which he would be charged with killing Giuliano. Some authorities were beginning to take his evidence more seriously, and perjury and other charges were made against police and Carabinieri. Pisciotta realised {{that he had been}} abandoned and was threatening to reveal much more than at the first trial, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano just before the attack. On February 9, 1954, he took a cup of coffee with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tuberculosis medicine. Instead someone had replaced it with strychnine. Within an hour he was dead and his autobiography disappeared.|$|E
25|$|He toured Zimbabwe and South Africa {{with the}} A team the {{following}} winter, and in 1999 his maiden first-class century, a well-timed 160 against Warwickshire, brought him selection {{for the first}} Test against New Zealand at Edgbaston. Still not 21, Read made a good impression: although he failed with the bat, he claimed eight dismissals, six in the second innings alone. He was retained for Lord's, but suffered a very public embarrassment when he was bowled for zero, ducking <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beamer from Chris Cairns but {{was in fact a}} well-disguised slower ball. 37 in the second innings was followed by another duck at Old Trafford, and he was dropped, though he did play in the 1999/2000 One Day International series in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1972, Catholic {{civilian}} Jean Smith (or Smyth) was shot dead on the Glen Road. Jean was a 24-year-old mother of one. She was shot while sitting {{in the passenger seat}} of a car at the Glen Road bus terminus. As her male companion turned the car, he heard <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tyre bursting. When he got out to check, the car was hit by a burst of automatic gunfire. Smith {{was shot in the head}} and died shortly afterward. Her companion stopped a passing taxi and asked the driver to take her to hospital. However, the taxi was then stopped by police and diverted to Andersonstown RUC base, where they were held for several hours.|$|E
25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger looked through the tape and found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E
25|$|To {{save the}} British from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{disastrous}} action {{and to stop}} the war from a possible escalation, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson proposed {{the creation of the}} first United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On 4 November 1956, a majority at the United Nations voted for Pearson's peacekeeping resolution, which mandated the UN peacekeepers to stay in Sinai unless both Egypt and Israel agreed to their withdrawal. The United States backed this proposal by putting pressure on the British government through the selling of sterling, which would cause it to depreciate. Britain then called a ceasefire, and later agreed to withdraw its troops {{by the end of the}} year. Pearson was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from Nasser the canal was closed until April 1957, when it was cleared with UN assistance. A UN force (UNEF) was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal, and peace in the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when {{it occurred to him that}} something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E
500|$|In 1606, he sailed from Bantam to {{the south}} coast of New Guinea, and {{continued}} down <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> southern extension of that coast, but {{was in fact the}} western coast of the Cape York Peninsula of northern Queensland. He travelled south as far as Cape Keerweer, where he battled with the local aboriginal people and several of his men were killed. As a consequence, he was obliged to retrace his route up the coast towards Cape York and then returned to Banda.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Tattersall spotted <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> color {{variant of}} the silky sifaka north of Vohemar in {{northeast}} Madagascar. [...] Describing it as such eight years later in The Primates of Madagascar, he not only cited its mostly white fur, but also uncharacteristic traits such as a patch of orange on its crown and tufted ears. [...] It was not observed again until 1986, when {{a team led by}} paleoanthropologist Elwyn L. Simons captured specimens for captive breeding and identified it as a new species, named as the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) in 1988.|$|E

500|$|On September 17, 1841, a New York printer named Samuel Adams {{went to see}} Colt {{to collect}} a debt over some {{textbooks}} that Adams had printed for him. The two disagreed over the final amount owed; sources indicate {{that it was a}} discrepancy of $1.35. According to Colt, Adams began choking him with his cravat. In self-defense, Colt reached for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hammer to fend him off, but the weapon {{turned out to be a}} hatchet. [...] Colt struck Adams four or five times with the weapon, causing Adams to drop to the floor.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, {{in a daze}} {{following}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> check by Toronto's Ace Bailey, {{charged the}} latter player from behind, flipping Bailey {{into the air and}} causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. [...] The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston. Neurosurgeons operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice. [...] Bailey survived, but he never played professionally again. [...] Shore ultimately served a 16-game suspension for the hit, and avoided being charged with manslaughter had Bailey died.|$|E
500|$|St.André {{was ordered}} by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London, so that further {{investigations}} could be carried out. [...] He was accompanied by Richard Manningham, a well-known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721, and the second son of Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester. [...] He examined Toft and found {{the right side of}} her abdomen slightly enlarged. [...] Manningham also delivered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hog's bladder—although St.André and Howard disagreed with his identification—but became suspicious as it smelled of urine. [...] Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29November lodged Toft in Lacey's Bagnio, in Leicester Fields.|$|E
