500|$|Goal Auzeen Saedi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: [...] "The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become." [...] Saedi also questioned {{their decision to}} appear on the show and added: [...] "But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the <b>way</b> <b>your</b> life is being lived and criticized, perhaps you can take the cameras out of your house." [...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change."
