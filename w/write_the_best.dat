[...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E
500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{rented a}} room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before {{discarding}} half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us." [...] Like Where You Want to Be, the band pushed themselves to <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> songs they could. For Where You Want to Be the group [...] "didn’t {{spend as much time}} playing together," [...] but for Louder Now [...] "we know each other’s playing. We know what we want and don’t want." ...|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E

500|$|Between 1989 and 1994, the {{two would}} work at The Actor's Gang together, and would {{collaborate}} in productions. Gass and Black wrote their first song in 1994 after Black had been dumped by a girlfriend, this song was scrapped aside from the pair playing it at later Tenacious D concerts as a joke and referencing it in interviews. Their second song came about when Black was listening to Metallica's [...] "One" [...] in 1994 and told Gass {{that it was the}} [...] "best song in the world". Gass told Black that they couldn't <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> song in the world but Black put a twist on it and said they could write a tribute. Gass played an A minor chord at his apartment and the two spent three full days crafting the song, when it was done Gass mentioned [...] "they knew they had something". The song made the duo realise their comedic potential.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus and Barker {{decided to}} {{continue}} on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to [...] "fill in" [...] for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so {{he was the first}} and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend [...] "18 hours" [...] in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. [...] "We all wanted to <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E

Guitarist Slash criticized Axl Rose for making the band seem [...] "like a dictatorship". Rose later stated about the dysfunction of the group at the time: [...] "We still needed the collaboration of the band as a whole to <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> songs. Since none of that happened, that's the reason why that material got scrapped." ...|$|E

The books were LaHaye's brainchild, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, did the actual writing of the books from LaHaye's notes. Jenkins has said, [...] "I <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis.

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E

5000|$|Accounts vary as to {{when and}} where Berlin <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> song.

Bungay's opinions, in truth, were pretty simple. He thought the Captain could <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> smashing article in England. He wanted the opposition house of Bacon smashed, and it was his opinion that the Captain could do that business. If the Captain had written a letter of Junius on a sheet of paper, or copied a part of the Church Catechism, Mr. Bungay would have been perfectly contented, and have considered that the article was a smashing article. And he pocketed the papers with the greatest satisfaction: and he not only paid for the MS., as we have seen, but he called little Mary to him, and gave her a penny as he went away.|$|E

6000|$|To {{those who}} know the {{literary}} world of London there was a sharp stroke of ironic comedy in the irresistible verdict in its favor. In critical literature there is one prize that is always open to competition, one blue ribbon that always carries the highest critical rank with it. To win, you must <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> book of your generation on Shakespear. It is felt on all sides that to do this a certain fastidious refinement, a delicacy of taste, a correctness of manner and tone, and high academic distinction {{in addition to the}} indispensable scholarship and literary reputation, are needed; and men who pretend to these qualifications are constantly looked to with a gentle expectation that presently they will achieve the great feat. Now if there is a man on earth who is the utter contrary of everything that this description implies; whose very existence is an insult to the ideal it realizes; whose eye disparages, whose resonant voice denounces, whose cold shoulder jostles every decency, every delicacy, every amenity, every dignity, every sweet usage of that quiet life of mutual admiration in which perfect Shakespearian appreciation is expected to arise, that man is Frank Harris. Here is one who is extraordinarily qualified, by a range of sympathy and understanding that extends from the ribaldry of a buccaneer to the shyest tendernesses of the most sensitive poetry, to {{be all things to all}} men, yet whose proud humor it is to be to every man, provided the man is eminent and pretentious, the champion of his enemies. To the Archbishop he is an atheist, to the atheist a Catholic mystic, to the Bismarckian Imperialist an Anacharsis Klootz, to Anacharsis Klootz a Washington, to Mrs Proudie a Don Juan, to Aspasia a John Knox: in short, to everyone his complement rather than his counterpart, his antagonist rather than his fellow-creature.

6000|$|When I {{said above}} that I {{believed}} in witches, {{but not in}} witch-smellers, I stated my full position about that conception of heredity, that half-formed philosophy of fears and omens; of curses and weird recurrence and darkness and the doom of blood, which, as preached to humanity to-day, is often more inhuman than witchcraft itself. I do not deny that this dark element exists; I only affirm that it is dark; or, in other words, that its most strenuous students are evidently {{in the dark about}} it. I would no more trust Dr. Karl Pearson on a heredity-hunt than on a heresy-hunt. I am perfectly ready to give my reasons for thinking this; and I believe any well-balanced person, if he reflects on them, will think as I do. There are two senses in which a man may be said to know or not know a subject. I know the subject of arithmetic, for instance; that is, I am not good at it, but I know what it is. I am sufficiently familiar with its use to see the absurdity of anyone who says, [...] "So vulgar a fraction cannot be mentioned before ladies," [...] or [...] "This unit is Unionist, I hope." [...] Considering myself for one moment as an arithmetician, I may say that I know next to nothing about my subject: but I know my subject. I know it in the street. There is the other kind of man, like Dr. Karl Pearson, who undoubtedly knows a vast amount about his subject; who undoubtedly lives in great forests of facts concerning kinship and inheritance. But it is not, by any means, the same thing to have searched the forests and to have recognised the frontiers. Indeed, the two things generally belong to two very different types of mind. I gravely doubt whether the Astronomer-Royal would <b>write</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> essay on the relations between astronomy and astrology. I doubt whether the President of the Geographical Society could give the best definition and history of the words [...] "geography" [...] and [...] "geology." ...|$|E

Some think I have lost that poetic ardour and fire 'tis said I once had--the fact is, perhaps I have; but, instead of that, I hope I shall substitute a more thoughtful and quiet power.

Then I pass across St. Cross meadows till you come to the most beautifully clear river--now this is only one mile of my walk.
