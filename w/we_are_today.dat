25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today,</b> should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|Scott's story {{concept was}} {{partially}} inspired by Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von Däniken's work about {{the theory of}} ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, [...] "NASA and the Vatican agree that [...] almost mathematically impossible {{that we can be}} where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today</b> without there being a little help along the way... That's what we're looking at , at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about." [...] Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but {{does not want to be}} anything like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from Aliens Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a response from}} practising Muslim Afroze Zaidi-Jivraj, a graduate in English who had recently begun a masters degree student in theology at the University of Birmingham. She remarked that Holland's methodology was flawed because he had neglected to study the corpus of material on early Islamic history found in libraries across the Islamic world, instead using only sources he had obtained in Western libraries. She argued {{that he did not}} consult a single Islamic scholar of Islamic history, instead choosing the more [...] "exotic" [...] option of interviewing a Bedouin, and that although he had consulted Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr– [...] "a token Muslim voice"– Nasr was a scholar of Islamic philosophy and not Islamic history. Asserting that Islam: The Untold Story was based on poor scholarship by assuming the superiority of secular Western historical inquiry over Islamic historical traditions, she argued that it would promote negative views of [...] "an already poorly-understood faith and its much-maligned adherents." [...] Abdullah al-Andalusi of the Muslim Debate Initiative sums Islam: the Untold Story as [...] "a missed opportunity to transcend an outdated Besserwissen approach to comparative religion, and to establish an inter-faith dialogue based on insightful mutual understanding and acceptance of who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> While informed revisionist readings of the history of all faiths, Islam included, is to be encouraged, Tom Holland’s TV show, an anti-Islamic polemic dressed up as history, does not do what it says on the tin.

[...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor.

2500|$|Jefferson's biographer Dumas Malone {{argued that}} the Kentucky {{resolution}} might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time.

[...] Historian Ron Chernow says of this [...] "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government {{of which he was}} vice president." [...] Jefferson [...] "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution." [...] Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. [...] Historian Garry Wills argued [...] "Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [...] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure" [...] The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was [...] "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if [...] "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would [...] "dissolve the union or produce coercion". [...] The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond.

Since already several years, a compromise peace, a peace negotiated with the opponent seemed to me commanded by the facts, while it commanded, in return, to put back in order our finances, the recovery of our economy and its expansion. Because this war placed on our country an unbearable burden. And here appears today a new and formidable threat: if the Indochina conflict is not resolved — and settled very fast — it is the risk of war, of international war and maybe atomic, that we must foresee. It is because I wanted a better peace that I wanted it earlier, when we had more assets. But even now there is some renouncings or abandons that the situation does not comprise.

When I heard the twist they put on it, man, {{it was kind of}} a no-brainer." [...] T.I. also chose the record for its crossover ability, which he has always been successful with in the past: [...] "It sounds like hip-hop with an international twist to it, and I'm known for taking those types of records and bridging that gap between what we do and what they do," [...] he explained, dropping in a couple of examples. [...] "From M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' to 'Swagga Like Us,' we took [...] 'Gypsy Woman' for 'Why You Wanna.'" [...] Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. in sharing some nostalgic stories, which he says reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] " [...] taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> It kinda puts me in the mind of the 'Da Art Of Storytellin' [...] from Outkast and Slick Rick.
