He had an elder brother, John, {{who was born in}} 1936. One of Chapman's earliest memories <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the horrific sights of this remained in his memory.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> ball well, and moving {{into some of the}} best form of his career so far, and made the most of it. Well supported by Hughes, who made a solid 30, Waugh began to free his arms, and lifted the Australian's run-rate.|$|E
25|$|When the King {{toured the}} front (24 October) Haig {{told him that}} Robertson should go home and become CIGS, whilst Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) “The Conduct of the War”, arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany. Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where he <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> King and Kitchener, “the first thing is to get you in command”.|$|E

25|$|During {{this year}} on the Asian continent, the several {{divisions}} of the old Mongol Empire were {{in a state of}} gradual decline. The Ilkhanate had already fragmented into several kingdoms struggling to place their puppet emperors over the shell of an old state. The Chagatai Khanate {{was in the midst of}} a civil war and one year from falling to rebellion. The Golden Horde to the north was besieging Genoese colonies along the coast of the Black Sea, and the Yuan dynasty in China <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> first seeds of a resistance which would lead to its downfall. Southeast Asia remained free from Mongol power, with several small kingdoms struggling for survival. The Siamese dynasty in that area vanquished the Sukhothai in this year. In the Indonesian Archipelago, the Majapahit Empire was in the midst of a golden age under the leadership of Gajah Mada, who remains a famous figure in Indonesia.|$|E
500|$|At 2 pm on 15 March, as Wasp cruised north-eastwards, Morrell records: [...] "Land {{was seen}} from the masthead, bearing west, {{distance}} 3 leagues" [...] (about nine miles, 14km). He did not at the time consider {{that he had made}} a new discovery; he seems to have assumed that he <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the western coast of which had been explored and given the name [...] "New South Greenland" [...] in 1821, by Robert Johnson, a former captain of the Wasp. [...] Johnson's name for this land was never adopted; in 1831 it was named Graham Land. At the time of Morrell's voyage the geographical character and dimensions of the peninsula were [...] unknown; Morrell's recorded position was in fact far to the east of the peninsula. Morrell's account reads: [...] "At half past [...] we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland". [...] The next few days were spent exploring this supposed coast, which was apparently rich in seal. Some [...] further south, Morrell thought he could see snow-covered mountains.|$|E
500|$|The Utah {{portion of}} I-70 was not {{completed}} to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, {{when the second}} Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, said the most memorable moment <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. He said before construction began, he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first [...] through the canyon required excavating [...] of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5million, $105.5million (1970, $595million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78million (1990, $130million in 2008) to construct the rest. At the 1970 dedication, it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation. UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I-70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah.|$|E

500|$|Shelley's {{trips to}} Italy were {{a way for}} her to revisit {{memories}} of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to [...] "expiate" [...] her survivor guilt and Dolan {{that she needed to}} recover from a damaging trauma. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, [...] "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [...] to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of my youth lie buried here." [...] Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her [...] "mind will... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".|$|E

2500|$|As a youth, Sullivan was {{a fervent}} {{supporter}} of Margaret Thatcher and later Ronald Reagan. He says of that time, [...] "What really {{made me a}} right-winger <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> left use the state to impose egalitarianism—on my school", after the Labour government in Britain tried to merge his admissions-selective school with the local comprehensive school. At Oxford, he became friends with future prominent conservatives William Hague and Niall Ferguson and became involved with Conservative Party politics.|$|E
2500|$|Minutes before impact, the {{aircraft}} had {{an altitude of}} 930 meters (3,050ft). It descended to 670meters (2,200ft) in the next 26 seconds, leveled for 16 seconds, then descended to sea level in one minute and 16 seconds. The pilots did not have control over the rate of descent, {{and the next thing}} remembered by the first officer <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> altimeter approaching zero. He attempted to pull up through back pressure and adding power, but {{the aircraft}} hit the water before he was able to execute this maneuver. The impact took place at 19:21:30 PST (03:21:30 on January 14 Coordinated Universal Time) in Santa Monica Bay, about [...] west of LAX, in international waters where the sea is 110meters (350ft) deep. The crew did not recall any unusual sink rate, buffeting and yawing, nor were there any instrument warnings except a last-moment flashing of the heading-difference light.|$|E
2500|$|Pico {{spent several}} months in Perugia and nearby Fratta, {{recovering}} from his injuries. It was there, as he wrote to Ficino, that [...] "divine Providence ... caused certain books to fall into my hands. They are Chaldean books ... of Esdras, of Zoroaster and of Melchior, oracles of the magi, which contain a brief and dry interpretation of Chaldean philosophy, but full of mystery." [...] It was also in Perugia that Pico {{was introduced to the}} mystical Hebrew Kabbalah, which fascinated him, as did the late classical Hermetic writers, such as Hermes Trismegistus. The Kabbalah and Hermetica were thought in Pico's time to be as ancient as the Old Testament, and for that reason, he accorded them an almost scriptural status. It was always Pico's intention to walk completely around a topic and look at it from many possible angles, in order to derive the truest possible vision of the thing itself. Syncretism, for Pico, <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> same absolute from many different points of view, a Scholastic approach with a strong modern resonance.|$|E
