500|$|In {{the act of}} not {{killing the}} assassin, the theme of disobedience is raised in [...] "The Living Daylights", with Bond calling <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "murder" [...] and {{subsequently}} dismissing his actions by saying [...] "with any luck it will cost me my Double-0 number". Raymond Benson considered [...] "Octopussy" [...] to be a morality tale, with greed bringing repercussions years later to the main protagonist, Dexter Smythe.|$|E
500|$|Just {{as little}} is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the {{wilderness}} to find out who he is and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Jor-El says, [...] "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son." [...] The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete , featuring the fall, resurrection and his battle with evil. Another vision was that of The Creation of Adam.|$|E
500|$|According to Jan Delasara, one of {{the major}} themes of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] is the {{exploration}} of [...] "irresistible physical drives." [...] In Betts' case, his desire to kill is due to a biological need, not a malevolent desire to murder. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff, in his review of the episode, wrote that [...] "It also helps that Leonard's such an understandably human monster. On some level, he just wants to survive, and he's not happy about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to be able to survive." [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] serves as the first story in a multi-season story-arc that features Agent Scully being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Richard Edwards, in the chapter [...] "Some Philosophical Reflections on 'Trust No One'" [...] of their book The Philosophy of The X-Files, argue that Scully withholding the knowledge of her cancer from Mulder is an example of psychological egoism in a protagonist. They reason that by not telling her partner, she is withholding the information in an act of self-interest.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 3D Mario games {{introduced}} Toad's role as {{a helper}} who would provide assistance to Mario if he needed it, thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In Super Mario 64, Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to proceed in the game. In the game's remake Super Mario 64 DS, Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray {{the rest of the}} group). In Luigi's Mansion, Toad appears {{in various parts of the}} mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in Super Mario Sunshine as Peach's attendants. In Super Mario Galaxy, Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the Toad Brigade led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars. [...] Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with Toadette as the two look at the night sky. Captain Toad makes a reappearance in the sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, once again as the same cowardly character as before.. Like in the first game, he and his brigade would attempt to help Mario retrieve the Power Stars in order to save Princess Peach.|$|E

I have written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he had secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and indeed, it is just this tenacity which has {{brought him to the}} top at Scotland Yard." ...|$|E

Eats one egg. Tramps up and down a promenade two hours with the other fools. Eats a butterfly. Slowly drinks a glass of filtered sewage that smells like a buzzard's breath. Promenades another two hours, but alone; if you speak to him he says anxiously, [...] "My water!--I am walking off my water!--please don't interrupt," [...] and goes stumping along again. Eats a candied roseleaf. Lies at rest in the silence and solitude of his room for hours; mustn't read, mustn't smoke. The doctor comes and feels of his heart, now, and his pulse, and thumps his breast and his back and his stomach, and listens for results through a penny flageolet; then orders the man's bath--half a degree, Reaumur, cooler than yesterday. After the bath another egg. A glass of sewage at three or four in the afternoon, and promenade solemnly with the other freaks. Dinner at 6--half a doughnut and a cup of tea. Walk again. Half-past 8, supper--more butterfly; at 9, to bed. Six weeks of this regime--think of it. It starves a man out and puts him in splendid condition. It would have the same effect in London, New York, Jericho--anywhere.' ...|$|E
6000|$|No, {{on second}} thoughts, I am {{determined}} I will not repeat that joke which I heard Hood make. He says he wrote these jokes with such ease {{that he sent}} manuscripts to the publishers faster than they could acknowledge the receipt thereof. I won't {{say that they were}} all good jokes, or that to read a great book full of them is a work at present altogether jocular. Writing to a friend respecting some memoir of him which had been published, Hood says, [...] "You will judge how well the author knows me, when he says my mind is rather serious than comic." [...] At the time when he wrote these words, he evidently undervalued his own serious power, and thought that in punning and broad-grinning lay his chief strength. Is not there something touching in that simplicity and humility of faith? [...] "To make laugh is my calling," [...] says he; [...] "I must jump, I must grin, I must tumble, I must turn language head over heels, and leap through grammar;" [...] and he goes to his work humbly and courageously, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that does he with all his might, through sickness, through sorrow, through exile, poverty, fever, depression--there he is, always ready to his work, and with a jewel of genius in his pocket! Why, when he laid down his puns and pranks, put the motley off, and spoke out of his heart, all England and America listened with tears and wonder! Other men have delusions of conceit, and fancy themselves greater than they are, and that the world slights them. Have we not heard how Liston always thought he ought to play Hamlet? Here is a man with a power to touch the heart almost unequalled, and he passes days and years in writing, [...] "Young Ben he was a nice young man," [...] and so forth. To say truth, I have been reading in a book of [...] "Hood's Own" [...] until I am perfectly angry. [...] "You great man, you good man, you true genius and poet," [...] I cry out, as I turn page after page. [...] "Do, do, make no more of these jokes, but be yourself, and take your station." ...|$|E
