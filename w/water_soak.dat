2500|$|Well users, {{including}} {{municipal water}} users, in the WRD area pump about [...] {{of water per}} year out of their aquifer. This is an [...] "overdraft" [...] of about [...] of water over what their underground aquifer can [...] "normally" [...] refill. To replace this [...] "overdraft" [...] of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish {{the water in the}} aquifer(s). In addition they buy Colorado River water that is shipped via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using reverse osmosis and advanced filtering. Their largest tertiary water treatment facility is the Leo J. Vander Lans Advanced Water Treatment facility. The water out of this facility is better than the water that comes out of the [...] "average" [...] municipal water treatment facility. To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per acre-foot of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year. WRD is now on a project (WIN) to enlarge their water treatment facilities to take larger quantities of treated municipal wastewater and treat enough of it that they will not have to buy Colorado River water. Overall it is estimated that this project provides over 40% of the water used in the Southern California district served by the WRD.|$|E

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the durability of}} wood-based boards, a number of accelerated aging tests are used [1 – 4], most of which involve <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at various temperatures. In JIS A 5908, for example, the A test uses 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C, and the B test uses 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C [5]. For the Engineered Wood Products Association, the test uses 8  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 66  °C followed by 14.5  h drying at 82  °C [6]. Although {{the most widely used}} accelerated aging test uses <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at various temperatures and times, no optimum test has yet been decided upon.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been made on the {{relationships}} between cyclic boil-dry treatment and board properties [6 – 8], but very few have detailed the effects of water-soaking condition on board properties. For example, when we compare 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C (A test in JIS) and 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C (B test in JIS), obviously the latter is more severe than the former, decreasing the latter properties more than the former [4]. Comparing 6  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C with 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C, {{it is very difficult}} to predict which condition decreases the board properties. In order to develop an optimum accelerated aging test, it is paramount to determine the effects of soaking temperature and time on board properties. Thereby, the purpose of this study is to clarify the roles played by soaking temperature and time.|$|R

50|$|Leather shaping or molding {{consists}} of soaking {{a piece of}} leather in hot or room temperature water to greatly increase pliability and then shaping it by hand or {{with the use of}} objects or even molds as forms. As the leather dries it stiffens and holds its shape. Carving and stamping may be done prior to molding. Dying however must take place after molding, as the <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> will remove much of the color. Molding has become popular among hobbyists whose crafts are related to fantasy, goth/steampunk culture and cosplay.|$|E
30|$|SEM {{analysis}} was used to investigate the microscopic structural changes occurring in THM woods. Cross sections of specimens were mounted on conductive adhesives, sputter coated with platinum, and observed under SEM (Hitachi S- 4800, Japan) at 10  kV voltages. Several images at 2000 × were obtained for each group of the specimens. The effect of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> on the changes in microstructure was also examined on the same samples after <b>water</b> <b>soaking.</b>|$|R
30|$|Given that {{boards are}} nailed when used for {{structural}} purposes, {{it is important}} to clarify the effects of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> on the properties of these boards. However, <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> tests have been conducted not to assess nail joint property, but to assess the modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength (IB), which hereafter are defined as basic properties. Moreover, the relationships between nail joint properties and the basic properties of the board <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have not been clarified.|$|R
30|$|Except for the IB of the PF board, {{as for the}} MOR of the PF board, the MOR and IB of the MDI board, {{there are}} {{differences}} between <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> and outdoor exposure. In particular, the MOR retention of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> was higher than that of outdoor exposure. The boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have poor mechanical properties solely because of the collapse of the bonding points, and the mechanism for the reduction of the properties is very simple. In contrast, the boards exposed outdoors have poor properties because of the collapse of the bonding points and biodegradation [10]. These factors interact, resulting in a major reduction in the properties of the boards exposed outdoors than {{in the case of the}} boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water.</b> These differences between outdoor exposure and <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> cause different reductions in the properties of both boards.|$|R
50|$|Concrete can be colored in many ways; color hardener, {{integral}} liquid or powder, acid stains {{to name a}} few. The {{process of}} integrally coloring the concrete offers {{the advantage of the}} entire volume being colored; however, the surface strength is not increased as with the use of color hardener. Dry shake color hardener is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the hardener on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> into the hardener you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1890s, {{there was}} a gradual {{encroachment}} by pastoralists up to the southern periphery of the Nullarbor Plain, {{but the lack of}} adequate water to sustain stock maintained the region relatively intact from intense exploitation. In 1933 the United Aborigines Missions established itself there, drawing substantial numbers of desert folk to the site for food and clothing, and four years later, the government established a 2,000 sq.mile reserve. In 1941, the anthropologist Berndt and his wife Catherine Berndt spent several months in the aboriginal camp at the <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> and mission in 1941, and in the following three year period (1942-1945) wrote one of the first scientific ethnographies of an Australian tribal group, based on his interviews in a community of some 700 desert people. Traditional life still continued since Ooldea lay on the fringe of the desert, and incoming aborigines could return to their old hunting style.|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{superior}} Salicaceae genotypes for afforestation {{and restoration}} activities {{in urban areas}} can greatly increase the provision of ecosystem services for long-term ecological sustainability. To address this opportunity, we collected native Populus L. (Salicaceae) and Salix L. (Salicaceae) scions from 3 sites on Staten Island, New York, and conducted a propagation study followed by greenhouse and nursery scale-up activities. Our objectives were to: 1) identify hormone treatments that enhanced root initiation and early growth of the native genotypes; 2) incorporate Salicaceae prop-agation methodology into phyto-recurrent selection; and 3) establish a population of genotypes {{that can be used}} for afforestation and restoration efforts throughout New York City. For Objective 1, we tested the response of 112 native genotypes and 11 common clones to 3 root hormone treatments (36 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 12 -h soak in 1 % IBA + 0. 5 % NAA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus powder dip in 0. 3 % IBA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 5 -s dip soak in 20 % IBA) and a <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> control. After 75 d of growth, the control treatment was more effective than the 0. 3 % IBA powder dip and as effective as the other treatments. Given broad clonal variation, there is a high probability of selecting genotypes for both afforestation and restoration. Although Salix exhibited greater relative propagation success than Populus, both genera should be used to in-crease overall genetic diversity. From a practical standpoint, scale-up activities led to establishment of a nursery population that will be used for ongoing afforestation and restoration activities in New York City...|$|E

40|$|The process {{involving}} a preliminary soaking of the mushrooms {{in water for}} 20 min followed by a chill storage period followed by a further <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> for 2 hr, and known as the 3 S process, gave a considerable reduction in total shrinkage in both brown and white strain canned mushrooms compared with the control samples. Water uptake by the mushrooms in the 3 S process was greatest when the soaking water temperature was between 20 and 30 °C and had a pH of 8. Citric acid in the blanch water enhanced the colour of the canned 3 S treated mushrooms. Blanching in water at pH 8 gave better weight retention in the canned 3 S product than when pH values were lower {{and the addition of}} starch to the blanch water also reduced blanching loss. Prestoring mushrooms for 72 hr prior to the 3 S process had no effect on total shrinkage values but gave a less white canned product. The use of the 3 S process on mushrooms for freezing resulted in better weight retention after blanching, but a less white product, compared with mushrooms that received a straight <b>water</b> <b>soak,</b> or no <b>water</b> <b>soak...</b>|$|E
