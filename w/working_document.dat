5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a <b>working</b> <b>document,</b> compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E
5|$|Each {{breakdown}} or setback {{during the}} early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a <b>working</b> <b>document</b> back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 2014, Francis {{presided over}} the 2014 Synod of Bishops. This was the first Church Synod to {{explicitly}} examine the issue of pastoral care for people in same-sex civil unions and marriages, identifying {{it as one of}} several concerns which were unheard of until a few years ago. The synod's <b>working</b> <b>document</b> called for less judgment towards people that are gay and more understanding towards same-sex couples in civil unions or marriages, as well as an equal welcome for children of such couples (including conferring baptism), while still rejecting the validity of same-sex marriage itself. However, when the synod convened to discuss the issue, the final report failed to contain the proposed language as it did not manage to receive the necessary two-thirds support of attending bishops' support.|$|E

500|$|A <b>working</b> <b>document</b> was {{ultimately}} produced {{and signed by}} Smith, Wilson and Gibbs, to be accepted or rejected in its entirety by each Cabinet after the Prime Ministers returned home. Whitehall accepted the proposals, but Salisbury turned them down; Smith announced on 5 December 1966 that while he and his ministers were largely satisfied with the terms, the Cabinet did not feel it could responsibly abandon the 1965 constitution while so much uncertainty surrounded the transition and the new [...] "mythical constitution yet to be evolved". Gondo, Rhodesia's Leader of the Opposition, promptly demanded Smith's resignation, reasoning that the Cabinet's rejection of the <b>working</b> <b>document</b> he had helped to draft amounted to a vote of no confidence. The RF ignored him. Warning that [...] "grave actions must follow", Wilson took the Rhodesia problem to the United Nations, which proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968). These measures required UN member states to prevent all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.|$|E
500|$|Although Harper was {{considered}} an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters—a 1965 report in The Economist called him [...] "by far the best brain" [...] in the Rhodesian Cabinet—his views were often perceived as overly reactionary. He led a phalanx of far-right voices within the RF calling for [...] "a form of political apartheid" [...] in Rhodesia, and while the party line was gradual advancement of black political representation, Harper called {{not only for the}} cessation of such moves, but for the abolition of black MPs altogether. He thus became something of an obstacle to an Anglo-Rhodesian settlement. Indeed, when Smith brought a <b>working</b> <b>document</b> back from the HMS Tiger talks with Wilson in October 1966, it was Harper who led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to its ultimate rejection. Harper considered himself to have been overlooked when Smith gave the office of Deputy Prime Minister (which had been vacant since UDI) to the more moderate Wrathall the month before the Tiger conference. The South African newspaper Die Beeld reported in December 1966 that the RF's right wing was poised to oust Smith in favour of Harper, but this did not occur.|$|E

Of 62 paragraphs in the synod's final report, the attention of the media was directed almost exclusively to issues discussed in 3 paragraphs which concerned how to pastorally care for Catholics living in [...] "irregular unions", including those civilly remarried after divorce (in particular their desire to receive the Eucharist), unmarried cohabitating couples, and especially gay Catholics. [...] The 2014 synod was also noted for a new prominence of African bishops.|$|E
