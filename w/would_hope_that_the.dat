Carson takes an aggressive stand when it comes to CTE and how the NFL handles their own ex-players that are struggling with head trauma later in their lives. Although Harry Carson was an excellent football player he does suggest that kids not start playing football because of the consequences that could come to them later in life. The NFL reached a concussion settlement of 765 million dollars for the former NFL players that sustained head injuries on the field. When Carson was asked about the settlement in a Frontline interview he says, [...] "And so I think everyone now has a better sense of what damage you can get from playing football. And I think the NFL has given everybody 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football" [...] (Carson). Harry Carson thinks the huge settlement is good for the former players, but it also scares people away from playing football because of the chances of head trauma players could experience later in life.|$|E

We <b>would</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> results obtained from a particular image are independant of our measuring process. A simple analogy is in using a ruler to measure the length of an object.

In image analysis we have the further problem of discretization.

Typically this involves tiling our original, real picture with rectangles and forming a representative value for the contents of each, producin [...] ...|$|E
