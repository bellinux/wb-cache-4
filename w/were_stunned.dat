5|$|The British <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> to {{find that}} Washington and the army had escaped. Later in the day, August 30, the British troops {{occupied}} the American fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it caused many festivities to take place. Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows and King George III gave Howe the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|Đôn {{and other}} {{officers}} <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> when the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters. Đôn confronted Minh in his office, {{and while they}} were remonstrating, Xuân entered the room. Unaware of Đôn's presence, Xuân snapped to attention and stated in French, “Mission accomplie”. Despite Đôn's investigation, no one was ever charged with the killings.|$|E
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> {{by the size}} and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E

5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|Chinese troops counterattacked {{in force}} at 23:00, with two battalions of {{infantry}} supported by snipers and mortar fire. Aided by 7th Division artillery fire, the Rangers held the hill against Chinese resistance. The Rangers repulsed four successive Chinese assaults {{by one of}} the battalions, expending all of their grenades by 02:00 on 18 May, and running short on ammunition by 03:00. At that point, the second Chinese battalion commenced its assault, surprising the Rangers and driving them from the peak of Hill 581. Queen counterattacked and retook the hill by 05:00. At 06:45, the Chinese gave up the attack, having been severely mauled. In the unsuccessful attempt to take Hill 581, Chinese losses amounted to at least 120 killed and several hundred injured. The Rangers, having relied on tight interlocking crossfire and well dug-in positions, suffered only 10 wounded in the battle. Commanders in the 7th Infantry Division <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by the 2nd Ranger Company's effectiveness in the fight, {{and as a result of}} the action, the company came to be considered a model unit.|$|E
5|$|In 197879, Harvey’s {{appointments}} increased. Harvey {{stood in}} all of Queensland's five home Shield matches, {{as well as their}} match against the touring Englishmen. He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG. At the end of the season, Harvey was selected for the first of his two Tests. The first, played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic. During the run-chase, the Australians <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz, just when they looked like winning. Sarfraz ended with 9/86the other wicket was run outas Australia collapsed from 3/305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs. Harvey’s partner was Robin Bailhache.|$|E

5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the Fiesta Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, the Fiesta Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|The game restarted, {{but many}} Bayern players were {{overwhelmed}} with despair, virtually unable {{to continue and}} needed the assistance of referee Pierluigi Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> to have lost a game they had thought won just minutes before (several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Munich fans moments before United equalised, and Bayern Munich ribbons had already been secured to the trophy itself {{in preparation for the}} presentation ceremony). United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title. Samuel Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating the floor in despair, and even the giant Carsten Jancker had collapsed in anguish. Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup Final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured, and the European Cup was the only major trophy he had failed to win during his career.|$|E
25|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia suffered about 20,000 casualties (3,494 killed, 15,758 wounded, and 952 captured or missing) {{out of a}} {{total of}} over 90,000 soldiers during the Seven Days. McClellan reported casualties of about 16,000 (1,734 killed, 8,062 wounded, and 6,053 captured or missing) {{out of a total}} of 105,445. Despite their victory, many Confederates <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by the losses.|$|E

Tzu-Chi, along with other Buddhist organizations and monasteries influenced by Yin Shun, joined in mourning for eight days, the length of his funeral.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{had become}} the rising Asian power and had proven that its {{military}} could combat the major powers in Europe with success. Most Western powers <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> that the Japanese not only prevailed but decisively defeated Russia. In the Russo–Japanese War, Japan had also portrayed a sense of readiness in taking a more active and leading role in Asian affairs, which in turn had led to widespread nationalism throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|However, {{following}} their consecutive third-place finishes {{some of the}} club's most influential players were bought by more famous clubs and Internapoli were relegated in bottom place.

It was a cruel relegation for the club when considering that the team who finished 9th were only three points above 16th place Internapoli.|$|E

25|$|Wales {{had gone}} into the Plate {{competition}} as favourites based on their rousing display against Fiji. However, they <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by the Spanish side who beat them 10–7. Argentina meanwhile displayed impressive dominance against South Korea and came through 24 point to nil. They {{went on to win the}} final 19–12 against a Spanish side that had distinguished themselves enormously, coming from the position of one of the four pre-tournament qualifiers to reaching the final of the Plate competition.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{was intense}} {{as the three}} pronged attack, {{consisting}} of the 2nd King's Own on the right flank, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch as the central force and the 2nd Queen's Own on the left flank, advanced to capture a series of prepared strongpoints leading to Ed Duda. Initially, the Italians <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by the massive fire and a company of the Pavia was overrun in the predawn darkness, but resistance in the Bologna gradually stiffened.|$|E
25|$|Brown, {{aware that}} nearly 1,000 men were {{away from the}} American {{settlements}} with the militias, urged Dragging Canoe and other Cherokee leaders to strike while they had the opportunity.

25|$|At about 10:00 pm, the 38th Army {{opened fire}} on protesters at the Wukesong {{intersection}} on Chang'an Avenue, about 10km west of Square. The crowds <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> that the army was using live ammunition and reacted by hurling insults and projectiles. Song Xiaoming, a 32-year-old aerospace technician, killed at Wukesong, was the first confirmed fatality of the night. The troops used expanding bullets, which expand upon entering the body and create larger wounds and also prevented collateral damage from bullets.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the NBA playoffs against the Charlotte Hornets the Celtics <b>were</b> <b>stunned</b> by the loss of Lewis, their leading scorer, who {{collapsed}} on the court during Game 1 and was diagnosed with what eventually proved to be a fatal heart condition. McHale performed brilliantly in the series. He averaged 19.6 points per game and shot 58 percent from the field—including a reminiscent performance of 30 points and 10 rebounds in Game 2—but Boston fell to the Hornets in four games.|$|E
25|$|Adding to the interracial {{animosity}} was {{the sense}} of many whites that their former slaves had betrayed them.
