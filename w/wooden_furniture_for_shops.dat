40|$|Malaysia has {{a strong}} market share in <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> and the {{witnessed}} fast growth made it a leading furniture exporter. Currently, Malaysia is the 8 th largest furniture export country. As an export dominated industry, the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry occupies a significant position in the Malaysian economic development. Since the industry is a challenged and deteriorating in global competition, the research objective is to evaluate the present situation and find out strategies {{on how to improve}} the Malaysian wooden industry's competitiveness. Accordingly, the research question aim to explore internationalism motivations, advantages, issues, actions in Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. Dunning's ecletic paradigm and Porter's value chain were adopted as basic theories in the current study. The main findings from this project indicates that the challenges of labour shortage, raw materials and product design issues are mostly influencing the development of the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. Meanwhile, it was observed that issues exist in any stages in the manufacturing value chain may influence the performing efficiency. Thus, the government, national institutions and <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers need to rapidly take labour, design and raw materials alternatives and innovative design approaches to promote the performance of the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> in the global market...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the applications of strategic management concepts and practices by Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> businesses in managing linkages in the value web and formulating competitive positioning strategies. For the purpose of the study, interviews were held with managers of the selected Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> businesses, and their key distributors/retailers and suppliers. The finding of the study shows that the strategic group concept is an important tool for understanding strategy, competition and opportunities within an industry. In the study, the geographical dimensions and the product dimensions of the market are used as the strategic dimensions for forming strategic groups (at the business level) of the selected Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> businesses: SG I (businesses in the low end segment of the domestic market); SG 2 (businesses in the medium segment of the domestic market); SG 3 businesses in the low end segment of the international market); and SG 4 (businesses in the medium segment of the international market). In terms of the management of linkages in the value web (in respect of selection criteria and channel relationships), the study demonstrates that it varies according to strategic groups. Specifically, greater variation is observed along the product dimensions than the geographical dimensions of the market. Meanwhile, it is observed that there are differences between the way businesses manage linkages in the downstream value web (with distributors/retailers) and upstream value web (with suppliers). As for the businesses' perceptions of competitors (in terms of the businesses' view about competition and categories of competitors considered), greater variation is observed along the product dimensions than the geographical dimensions of the market. However, most businesses (irrespective of their strategic group membership) appear to give low attention to competitors and to have no clear approach for organising competitor analysis. In the formulation of competitive positioning strategies, the study shows that the activities undertaken and approaches considered (in respect of defining markets determining the key factors for success, identifying sources of sustainable competitive advantage formulating competitive strategies and developing positioning themes) vary more along the product dimensions than the geographical dimensions of the market. Although the activities undertaken and approaches considered by members of SG 4 are broader that those of other strategic groups, they are not fully adequate as certain factors in the external environment have not been explicitly considered. Hence, it is suggested that the rotating wheel framework. which is based on pull-factor and push-factor approaches, should be considered by Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> businesses <b>for</b> the formulation of competitive positioning strategies. The distinctive characteristics of the rotating wheel framework are: an integration of concepts from the strategic management and marketing disciplines; an integration ofthe competitive forces perspective and the resource-based view perspective within the field of strategic management; a broadened concept of environmental analysis, and a dynamic analysis ofthe competitive environment. As regards the measurement of businesses' competitive advantage. the study reveals that the added value concept offers not just an alternative, but an important measure of businesses' performance, particularly in terms of their ability to add value. Specifically, the study shows that the added value contribution of businesses varies according to strategic groups: members of SG 4 add greater value to their inputs than those of members of SG 3, who in turn add more value than those of members of SG 1. Finally, recommendations (in respect of management of linkages in the value web, formulation of competitive positioning strategies and measurement of businesses' performance) are made for the consideration of Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> businesses and the government...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{occupational}} {{accidents in}} the value-added wood products industry, particularly the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry is grossly lacking. Therefore, {{the risk factors}} for injuries to workers in the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry were studied in fifty wood-furniture manufacturing factories, using a structured questionnaire. The three primary risk factors for accidents in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry were: Nature of work, workers characteristics and prevailing safety climate, while the use of dangerous machinery and poor layout {{were found to be}} secondary accident causing risk factors. The findings of the study show conclusively that the prevailing safety climate and workers’ characteristics have the strongest influence on accident rate in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. It must also be recognized that the production oriented mentality prevalent in the industry appears to contribute towards the compromised occupational safety and health standards in the industry. In this context, it is essential for the policy makers to implement binding legislations that would safe guard the safety and health of the workers, while mandating the factory management to show commitment towards the workers health and safety to ensure a safe working environment in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industry...|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{socioeconomic}} {{importance and}} the labour intensive {{nature of the}} sector, {{the status of the}} health and safety of the workers in the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry has not been studied and reports on the subject is sparse. Therefore, the safety climate, which defines the safety level of the work environment, in the Malaysian <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> industry was studied in thirty wood-furniture manufacturing factories, using a structured questionnaire. The study found that although there were four determinants of the prevailing safety climate in the work environment, it was the management responsibility and safety precautions that had the strongest influence on safety climate. Further, the primary health and safety concerns in the <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industry were the air-borne dust, noise, chemical exposure, materials handling and occupational accidents.

Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of perceived coherence. One hundred thirty-one students evaluated three (virtual) natural environments: an environment with metal furniture, an environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture,</b> and an environment without furniture. Results showed that metal furniture negatively influenced perceived coherence as well as preference, pleasure and restoration, compared to <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> and no furniture. Perceived coherence of the environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> {{was significantly higher than}} the environment with metal furniture, but significantly lower than the environment without furniture. We did not find support that preference for, and experienced pleasure and restoration in the environment with <b>wooden</b> <b>furniture</b> differed from the environment without furniture.
