5|$|Entering 2008, the Bulls {{sought to}} build off of their 2007 season, where {{they shared the}} MAC East {{championship}} but did {{not appear in the}} championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to be no better than 3–9.|$|E

5|$|As Ophelia <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to pass near {{southeast}} New England, the NHC issued {{tropical storm}} warnings {{for much of}} the south Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastlines. In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, primarily because of memories of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which had caught the authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E

The proposed aquarium <b>was</b> <b>predicted</b> to attract 350,000 paying visitors annually, so Packard donated US$7 million for the construction of the building. After seven years of construction and US$47 million more from Packard, totaling US$54 million, Monterey Bay Aquarium opened on October 20, 1984 as the largest public aquarium in the United States. About 2.4 million people visited the aquarium within the following year.|$|E

40|$|Predictions of alpha heating in L-mode and H-mode DT plasmas in ITER are {{generated}} using the PTRANSP code. The baseline toroidal field of 5. 3 T, plasma current ramped to 15 MA and a flat {{electron density profile}} ramped to Greenwald fraction 0. 85 are assumed. Various combinations of external heating by negative ion neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonance, and electron cyclotron resonance are assumed to start half-way up the density ramp. The time evolution of plasma temperatures and, for some cases, toroidal rotation <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming GLF 23 and boundary parameters. Significant toroidal rotation and flow-shearing rates <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> by GLF 23 even in the L-mode phase with low boundary temperatures, and the alpha heating power <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> significant if the power threshold for the transition to H-mode {{is higher than the}} planned total heating power. The alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 8 - 76 MW in L-mode at full density. External heating mixes with higher beam injection power have higher alpha heating power. Alternatively if the toroidal rotation <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming that the ratio of the momentum to thermal ion energy conductivity is 0. 5, the flow-shearing rate <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to have insignificant effects on the GLF 23 - predicted temperatures, and alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> 8 - 20 MW. In H-mode plasmas the alpha heating <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to depend sensitively on the assumed pedestal temperatures.
