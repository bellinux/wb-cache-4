40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology. He taught that humans exist with {{the express purpose of}} accumulating light and truth. This accumulation would continue after death throughout eternity. Young taught that an ineluctable factor in this progression was suffering and for this reason, Young condoned God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon hardship. By weaving these cosmological teachings with his pragmatic counsel, Young taught the Latter-day Saints to view their daily lives [...] full of struggles, pain, and fear [...] within a cosmological framework.

Although euphausiids were the most common major prey of all three predators, gelatinous zooplankton and fishes were the most commonly consumed prey items during some seasonal quarters. The influence of the El Niño event was evident in the diets. Anomalous prey items, including the southern euphausiid species Nyctiphanes simplex and juveniles of Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) frequently appeared in the diets {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. The results of stomach contents analyses, based on 905 stomach samples from 49 trawl hauls during seven commercial fishing trips and from 56 stations during research surveys, were consistent with the timing of occurrence and the magnitude of change in biomass of some zooplankton species reported from zooplankton studies in the northern California Current during the 1997 – 98 El Niño. Our findings indicate that the observed variations of prey groups in some rockfish diets may be a function of prey variability related to climate and environment changes...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{debates about}} the merits of {{one form or another}} of day care {{frequently}} miss some significant issues and hence some of the important policy options may be ruled out or in for the wrong reasons. Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R
