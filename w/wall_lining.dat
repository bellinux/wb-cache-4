5|$|Operation Badr was {{preceded by}} {{training}} exercises starting in 1968, operational planning from 1971 onwards and a deception operation. In the opening stages of the attack, known as The Crossing (العبور; al-'obour), combat engineers used water cannons to rapidly clear numerous passages through the sand <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> the east bank of the canal, laid bridges and operated ferries, allowing armor to cross. Egyptian infantry assaulted the Bar-Lev fortifications and were counterattacked by Israeli armor and infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} lap, a large crash necessitated {{the deployment of}} the safety car. Jefferies was defending his position from Sato on the straight linking turns three and four and Sato went into Jefferies's rear-end. Sato punted Jefferies into a heavy collision with the <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> the circuit at high speed. Jefferies's vehicle then slid across the tarmac at turn one and stopped in the gravel trap without collecting any other cars. Jefferies was unhurt. At the lap six restart, Vandoorne remained the leader but Richelmi, Coletti, Haryanto and Nasr elected to make pit stops for the mandatory change to the hard compound tyre. Evans and Palmer made their pit stops on {{the following}} lap, though Vandoorne committed himself to making track position pay off and extended his advantage to five seconds in front of Pic who were also required to make their pit stops. Richelmi lost positions but his teammate Palmer moved back up the field and into third position. Nasr became disgruntled when Cecotto forced him {{to the side of}} the track while battling for position. Vandoorne ceded first place to Berthon at the end of lap nine when he made his pit stop and rejoined with a two-second advantage over Palmer.|$|E

25|$|Heidfeld allowed {{teammate}} Rosenqvist to {{move back}} into second place on the 48th (and penultimate) lap. Despite picking up oversteer in the race's closing stages, Bird opened up a healthy advantage and crossed the start/finish line after 49 laps to win the race. Gasly caught the Mahindra cars of Rosenqvist and Heidfeld on the final lap, and all three drivers concertinaed through the final turn. While challenging Heidfeld for third position, Gasly carried too much speed entering the final corner, drifted into the <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> the track, and hurling a detachable barrier on the circuit, which was not collected by any other driver. Rosenqvist took second, with Heidfeld finishing third, narrowly ahead of Gasly's damaged car. Di Grassi was fifth, Prost sixth, Dillmann seventh and Vergne eighth. Frijns's additional electrical energy allowed him to pass four cars on the final lap and took ninth. D'Ambrosio rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Carroll, Sarrazin, Duval and Turvey were {{in the next four}} places with Félix da Costa and Piquet the last of the classified finishers. It was Bird's second victory of the season, his second consecutive in New York City, and the fifth of his career. He was the first driver to win both races of a double header weekend since Prost at the 2016 London ePrix. There was one lead change during the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Bird led once for a total of 29 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside <b>wall</b> <b>lining,</b> size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, a {{shear wall}} is a structural system composed of braced panels (also known as shear panels) to counter the effects of lateral load acting on a structure. Wind and seismic loads {{are the most common}} loads that shear walls are designed to carry. Under several building codes, including the International Building Code (where it is called a braced <b>wall</b> <b>line)</b> and Uniform Building Code, all exterior <b>wall</b> <b>lines</b> in wood or steel frame construction must be braced. Depending {{on the size of the}} building some interior walls must be braced as well.|$|R
