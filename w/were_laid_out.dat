5|$|A {{charter to}} hold a market in Churchgate was granted on 14 December 1251 by King Henry III of England.

Burgage plots <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> on Churchgate and Deansgate in {{the centre of the}} medieval town close to where Ye Olde Man & Scythe public house, dating from 1251, is {{situated}} today.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|Oakwood was {{designed}} by John C. Sidney, a Philadelphia engineer familiar with cemetery design, {{with the help of}} Garnet Douglass Baltimore, the first African American to earn a degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about , including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in a seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the grounds}} were donated to the local parish after Beckford's death and consecrated as a {{cemetery}} in 1848.

5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} {{that they had}} in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E

5|$|The castle, {{situated}} on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, {{is one of}} the largest in Scotland in area. It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} house may {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which <b>were</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in the Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming {{the upper and lower}} terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E
5|$|The site core of El Chal {{consists}} of an acropolis and three ceremonial plazas in which the majority of sculpted monuments were found, the East Plaza, West Plaza and Northeast Plaza. There are also {{a number of other}} plazas in the site core.
