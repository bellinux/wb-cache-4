40|$|The Skylab Saturn <b>Workshop</b> <b>Assembly</b> was {{designed}} to expand the knowledge of manned earth orbital operations and accomplish a multitude of scientific experiments. The Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), a module of the Skylab Saturn <b>Workshop</b> <b>Assembly,</b> was the first manned solar observatory to successfully observe, monitor, and record the structure and behavior of the sun outside the earth's atmosphere. The ATM contained eight solar telescopes that recorded solar phenomena in X-ray, ultraviolet, white light, and hydrogen alpha regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the ATM contained the Saturn Workshop Assembly's pointing and attitude control system, a data and communication system, and a solar array/rechargeable battery power system. This document presents the overall ATM thermal design philosophy, premission and mission support activity, and the mission thermal evaluation. Emphasis is placed on premission planning and orbital performance with particular attention on problems encountered during the mission. ATM thermal performance was satisfactory throughout the mission. Although several anomalies occurred, no failure was directly attributable to a deficiency in the thermal design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In multistoried {{buildings}} {{flat slab}} and waffle slab are generally engaged when column spacing is more. Flat slabs and waffle slabs {{are used in}} buildings in requirement of more working space like commercial buildings, <b>workshops,</b> <b>assembly</b> buildings, etc. The main disadvantage of structures with flat slab and waffle slab are there lack of withstanding seismic loads. Special features like shear walls are used to help the building to resist the lateral loads caused due to high winds and seismic loads. In this paper, an attempt {{has been made to}} investigate the seismic effect on multi storey building of G+ 9, G+ 14 and G+ 19 floors with waffle slab and flat slab using the software ETABS 2013. The seismic evolution is performed by response spectrum analysis as per IS 1893 (2002). It is observed that waffle slabs are advisable for structure with a height less than 40 m, whereas for structures of height above 40 m it is advisable to go with flat slab...|$|R

40|$|International audience— Today's {{global market}} {{is subject to}} high {{competition}} and many companies face the necessity of cost reduction. In this context, the current study focuses on the efficiency of manufacturing and, especially, on how industries can lay out their facilities taking into account investment and operating costs (logistic flow) to increase their efficiency. A model is proposed to resolve the facility layout of a final <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop</b> using constraint programming. Due {{to the complexity of}} the problem, a three-stage heuristic solution algorithm is derived from this model. This proposition has the particularity of integrating the basic investment and operating costs, and considers supply costs of component storages on the line sides. The method is detailed in a case study involving a carmaker final <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop.</b> Due to constraint programming flexibility, equivalent approaches can be applied to different facility layout contexts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} been made {{concerning}} the control and the flow optimisation in car assembly plants {{in order to satisfy}} the expectations and customer needs. But investigations of the same nature were not observed so far in component manufacturing plants. That is why we propose in this paper to study the production management problem in an engine plant, in particular the scheduling problem of an engine <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop.</b> Firstly, we present the characteristics of an engine plant. Secondly, we provide an integer linear model, which helps the manager to take the best decisions for the scheduling of the engines. This optimisation model tries to group and sequence the engines so that all the workshop constraints, required by the production manager and the customers, are satisfied. We apply this tool to real data, coming from an engine <b>assembly</b> <b>workshop,</b> and the obtained results are compared to the current manual schedules...|$|R
50|$|The 144 Ariane 1 to 4 used a {{total of}} 958 Viking engines. Only 2 engines {{have led to a}} failure. The first failure was due to a crack in the {{combustion}} chamber, the second is of human origin: a rag had been left in a pipe during installation. Initially, all the engines were tested before being integrated on a launcher. Beginning in 1998, engineers, confident of the reliability of the engine, authorized the use of untested engines on launchers. Some engines, randomly taken in the <b>workshops</b> of <b>assembly,</b> were tested from time to time. This confidence is very rare in the world of space engines.|$|R

50|$|The Heiner Road Railway Overpass is {{important}} in illustrating a vital step {{in the development of}} Queensland when the first stage of the new colony's railway network was established, opening in 1865. The Wharf Line predated the construction of the main line between Ipswich and Grandchester. Because Ipswich was a river port and the majority of components for the railway were delivered by ship from Britain, the line connecting the government wharf with the <b>workshops,</b> where <b>assembly</b> took place, was laid first and was {{an essential part of the}} construction strategy. The plans for the substantial masonry abutments that carried the road connecting with the rail and road bridge over the Bremer River over this line survive and are evidence for the importance accorded to this overpass and to the inauguration of the transport network essential to develop the colony.|$|R

50|$|The South Australian Railways {{resisted}} Commonwealth {{requests to}} defer a programme of locomotive construction but eventually agreed to assemble twelve ASGs at its Islington Railway Workshops although {{it refused to}} make officers available {{to assist with the}} design work. The New South Wales Government Railways could not undertake assembly work, because its workshops were equipped for only maintenance and new workshops built for locomotive construction were making munitions. They did agree though, that their locomotives then being built by Clyde Engineering could be deferred in favour of that company assembling ASGs, and promised staff to carry out inspections of construction. The Tasmanian Government Railways, claimed Mills, also agreed to defer its locomotive construction programme and the Victorian Railways and WAGR agreed likewise and further, offered their <b>workshops</b> as <b>assembly</b> places. Thus assembly was to take place at four locations: Midland Railway Workshops (Western Australia), Islington Railway Workshops (South Australia), Newport Workshops (Victoria), and Clyde Engineering (New South Wales).|$|R
