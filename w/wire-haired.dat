25|$|Cerebellar {{hypoplasia}} is {{an incomplete}} {{development of the}} cerebellum. The most common cause in dogs is an in utero infection with canine herpesvirus. It is also seen associated with lissencephaly in <b>Wire-haired</b> Fox Terriers and Irish Setters, and as a separate condition in Chow Chows.|$|E
25|$|Wirehaired Vizsla, a {{separate}} breed from the Vizsla. The <b>Wire-haired</b> Vizsla {{was developed in}} the 1930s by the interbreeding of the Vizsla and the German Wirehaired Pointer to get a dog with a more substantial frame and a heavier coat, suitable for working in colder weather.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the Spinone became {{close to}} extinct. Both {{the war and}} the fact that Italian hunters had begun using other breeds (such as setters, pointers, and spaniels) in the hunt, whereas before it was {{primarily}} the Spinone. Many breeders had to resort to crossing the Spinone with other <b>wire-haired</b> breeds, such as the Boulet, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and German Wirehaired Pointer.|$|E
25|$|Acceptable {{variants}} (UK and US) {{are solid}} white, white with orange markings, orange roan {{with or without}} orange markings, white with brown markings, and brown roan with or without brown markings. Pigment of skin, nose, lips, and the pads on their feet should be a fleshy red-orange in white dogs, slightly darker in orange and brown roan dogs. The white and orange coloration is unique amongst the <b>wire-haired</b> gun dogs.|$|E
2500|$|Andy and Olaf {{spent some}} time {{traveling}} to Needles to live with Spike. However, after [...] "two right turns and twenty-three wrong ones" [...] they eventually ended up back at Snoopy's doghouse. After a brief stay and failure to become Rerun's dogs, they continued to wander around and were considering buying banjos in their last appearance on September 27, 1999. Notably, Andy is the only Peanuts character to have originated in animation before appearing in the strip (with the exception of Molly, Rover and Missy (the mother)): his animated debut was the 1991 TV special Snoopy's Reunion. Andy {{is based on a}} <b>wire-haired</b> fox terrier (also named Andy) that Schulz owned from October 1988 to March 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Nicholas Dodman {{describes}} {{a wide variety}} of OCD-like behaviors in his book Dogs Behaving Badly. [...] Such behaviors typically appear when the dog is placed in a stressful situation, including an environment that is not very stimulating or a history of abuse. [...] Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions. [...] Lick granuloma, or licking repeatedly until ulcers form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like Labradors, golden retrievers, Great Danes, and Dobermans, while bull terriers, German shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Rottweilers, <b>wire-haired</b> fox terriers, and springer spaniels are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows. [...] These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect of the behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|The three {{variations}} of this dog, the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois), the Belgian Griffon (Griffon Belge), and the Petit Brabançon, all descend {{from an old}} type of dog called a Smousje, a rough coated, small terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rodents, similar to the Dutch Smoushond. [...] The little <b>wire-haired</b> dog in the foreground of the Jan van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage {{is thought to be}} an early form of this breed. [...] In Belgium coachmen were fond of their alert little Griffons d’Ecurie (wiry coated stable dogs) and in the 19th century, they bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs. Breeding with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel brought about the current breed type, but also brought the short black coat that led to the Petits Brabançon, which was originally a fault in the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon Bruxellois and Griffon Belge.|$|E
60|$|The {{speaker was}} the little <b>wire-haired</b> man; and emotion, deep and angry, stirred in Mr. Bosengate. That ill-bred little cur! He gripped {{the edge of the}} table with both hands.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bosengate {{stared at}} that little <b>wire-haired</b> brute. [...] "Haven't you any feeling for others?" [...] {{he wanted to}} say. [...] "Can't you see that this poor devil suffers tortures?" [...] But the sheer impossibility of doing this before ten other men brought a slight sweat out {{on his face and}} hands; and in {{agitation}} he smote the table a blow with his fist. The effect was instantaneous. Everybody looked at the <b>wire-haired</b> man, as if saying: [...] "Yes, you've gone a bit too far there!" [...] The [...] "little brute" [...] stood it for a moment, then muttered surlily: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was hot," [...] she answered. Their {{conversation}} became private, {{owing to}} Mrs. Paley's deafness {{and the long}} sad history which Mrs. Elliot had embarked upon of a <b>wire-haired</b> terrier, white with just one black spot, belonging to an uncle of hers, which had committed suicide. [...] "Animals do commit suicide," [...] she sighed, as if she asserted a painful fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} did--said so himself," [...] Mr. Bosengate heard the <b>wire-haired</b> man snap out, {{and from the}} {{following}} murmur of assent he alone abstained. Guilty! Well--yes! There was no way out of admitting that, but his feelings revolted against handing [...] "that poor little beggar" [...] over to the tender mercy of his country's law. His whole soul rose in arms against agreeing with that ill-bred little cur, {{and the rest of}} this job-lot. He had an impulse to get up and walk out, saying: [...] "Settle it your own way. Good morning." ...|$|E
60|$|I have a {{peculiar}} aversion to these ink-pots. Once in Liguria {{we had a}} boat of our own and paddled with the peasant paddlers. Alessandro caught ink-pots: and like this. He tied up a female by a string in a cave--the string going through a convenient hole in her end. There she lived, like an Amphitrite's <b>wire-haired</b> terrier tied up, till Alessandro went a-fishing. Then he towed her, like a poodle behind. And thus, like a poodly-bitch, she attracted hangers-on in the briny seas. And these poor polyp inamorati were the victims. They were lifted as prey on board, where I looked with horror on their grey, translucent tentacles and large, cold, stony eyes. The she-polyp was towed behind again. But {{after a few days}} she died.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Britling did {{not look}} at all as Mr. Direck had {{expected}} him to look. He had expected an Englishman in a country costume of golfing tweeds, like the Englishman in country costume one sees in American illustrated stories. Drooping out of the country costume of golfing tweeds he had expected to see the mildly unhappy face, pensive even to its drooping moustache, with which Mr. Britling's publisher had for some faulty and unfortunate reason familiarised the American public. Instead of this, Mr. Britling was in a miscellaneous costume, and mildness was the last quality one could attribute to him. His moustache, his hair, his eyebrows bristled; his flaming freckled face seemed about to bristle too. His little hazel eyes came out with a [...] "ping" [...] and looked at Mr. Direck. Mr. Britling was one of a large but still remarkable class of people who seem at the mere approach of photography to change their hair, their clothes, their moral natures. No photographer had ever caught a hint of his essential Britlingness and bristlingness. Only the camera could ever induce Mr. Britling to brush his hair, and for the camera alone did he reserve that expression of submissive martyrdom Mr. Direck knew. And Mr. Direck was altogether unprepared for a certain casualness of costume that sometimes overtook Mr. Britling. He was wearing now a very old blue flannel blazer, no hat, and a pair of knickerbockers, not tweed breeches but tweed knickerbockers of a remarkable bagginess, and made of one of those virtuous socialistic homespun tweeds that drag out into woolly knots and strings wherever there is attrition. His stockings were worsted and wrinkled, and on his feet were those extraordinary slippers of bright-coloured bast-like interwoven material one buys in the north of France. These were purple with a touch of green. He had, in fact, thought of the necessity of meeting Mr. Direck at the station at the very last moment, and had come away from his study in the clothes that had happened to him when he got up. His face wore the amiable expression of a <b>wire-haired</b> terrier disposed to be friendly, and it struck Mr. Direck that for a man of his real intellectual distinction Mr. Britling was unusually short.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wire-haired</b> dachshund, {{the last}} to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a {{possibility}} the <b>wire-haired</b> dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and <b>wire-haired</b> pinschers, such as the Schnauzer, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, the German Wirehaired Pointer, or perhaps the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>wire-haired</b> dogs (L/- W/-), {{this gene}} causes short-wire coats (e.g., Border Terrier, <b>Wire-haired</b> Dachshund, German Wirehaired Pointer) only when homozygous, {{and has no}} effect on length when heterozygous. Short-wire coats may have a {{bristled}} undercoat.|$|E
