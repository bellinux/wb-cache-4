The couple met at a Giorgio Armani afterparty in 2002, and married on 14 July 2004 in a private {{ceremony}} {{on a golf course}} in Washington, D.C. They communicate with each other in Italian, though Shevchenko had previously made public his desire to learn English. After his return to Dynamo Kyiv in August 2009, the couple declared that they <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to learn Ukrainian.|$|E
25|$|This {{is further}} {{explored}} in other novels, and is notably covered in some depth in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, where Albus Dumbledore writes notes after each story which often concerns itself with Wizard-Muggle relationships. Part of these 'observations' note how The Tales were modified {{in the face}} of anti-muggle sentiment in order to remove any pro-muggle messages for wizards who did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> exposed to those messages (including Lucius Malfoy who demanded that the Tales be removed from the Hogwarts).|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Wolff, {{the family}} made the film without expecting a {{television}} series spin-off. Their agent believed the film would be lucrative and market research showed a positive reaction {{with a young}} audience. After the film was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival, Nickelodeon bought it. Moreover, [...] "Albie Hecht had an independent production deal with Nickelodeon" [...] and believed the film suited the network and that a television show was feasible. Draper and Wolff did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in show business {{at such a young}} age but agreed when Hecht's agent promised to work within the boy's schedule, so that they would not miss school. This meant a summer shooting schedule in New York and short, 13-episode seasons. Nonetheless, after three seasons, despite the extremely high ratings, network executives urged the family to lengthen the 13 episode season to 60. Draper and Wolff refused, and as a result, the series was cancelled without any public announcement made by the network.|$|E

500|$|The crisis over school {{desegregation}} worsened throughout 1955. On May 31, 1955, the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (known as Brown II) ordered that {{school desegregation}} occur with [...] "all deliberate speed". Two weeks later, Governor Stanley and the Virginia State Board of Education announced that state policy {{would be to}} continue to operate the state's public schools on a segregated basis. Then, in a seemingly unrelated case, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled on November 7, 1955, in Almond v. Day that providing state funds to private schools violated Article 141 of the state constitution. (In 1954, the Virginia General Assembly had enacted legislation providing educational vouchers to underage dependents of veterans who were wounded or had died in World War I.) Kilpatrick and several Virginia political leaders had supported vouchers {{as a way of}} circumventing desegregation, and the Almond decision struck directly at this proposal. The Gray Commission issued its report just five days after the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Almond. The report, which wholeheartedly supported racial segregation in schools and denounced the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown decision, made a number of recommendations. Two stood out. [...] First, the Commission proposed that the state constitution be amended to permit education vouchers to be given to those parents who did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> attending integrated schools, or to those children who lived in counties where public schools had been abolished. Second, the Commission advised amending state education law to permit local school boards to assign students to schools on the basis of factors (such as aptitude, availability of facilities, health, and transportation needs) other than race.|$|E

Following {{criticism of}} The Golden Compass by Catholic leaders as anti-Catholic, Kidman told Entertainment Weekly that the Catholic Church {{is part of}} her [...] "essence," [...] and that her religious beliefs would prevent her from taking a role in a film she perceived was anti-Catholic.

2500|$|In 1894, a {{group of}} Hopi parents {{announced}} that they were against the ideas of Washington and did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> {{to be exposed to}} the culture of white Americans. The government sent troops to arrest the 19 parents and sent them to Alcatraz Prison, where they stayed for a year. [...] Another Oraibi leader, Lomahongyoma, competed with Lololoma for village leadership. [...] In 1906 the village split after a conflict between hostiles and friendlies. The conservative hostiles left and formed a new village, known as Hotevilla.|$|E

2500|$|She {{had mixed}} {{fortunes}} in 1980 as she endured hamstring pain. She won the 60 metres at the AIAW indoor meet, {{but failed to}} defend her AIAW title, coming fifth, and {{dropped out of the}} relay due to her injury. Her third and final Olympic appearance came at the age of 27 at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where she ran in the heats of the 100m and came sixth in the relay with Pusey, Allwood, and Ottey (setting a Jamaican record of 43.19 seconds). While there Hodges commented on the lack of children in the city, and posited that the Soviet's did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> engaging with Westerners. Hodges was disappointed with the relay team's Olympic result, as a poor baton change between Allwood and Ottey led to a slower time. Hodges blamed Ottey, who had run off too early and performed poorly in practice, saying [...] "She never focused on the relays. She was just so obsessed with her own race." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Reconstruction, the {{legislature}} established public {{education for the}} first time, providing for white and black schools. All children of color were assigned to black schools, which were dominated by the children of freedmen (freed slaves). Persons of color in Robeson County who had been free before the war did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> going to such schools, and asked for separate schools. In the 1880s, as the Democratic Party was struggling against the biracial Populist movement which combined the strength of poor whites (Populist and Democrats) and blacks (mostly Republicans), Democratic state representative Hamilton MacMillan proposed to have the state recognize these mixt people of Robeson County as the [...] "Croatan Indians" [...] {{and to create a}} separate system of Croatan Indian schools. [...] MacMillan's success in gaining an Indian recognition and separate status for this group gave them a social status above most blacks, but still below whites. The [...] "Croatan Indians" [...] gratefully voted for MacMillan and his fellow Democrats and were authorized to have Indian schools in Robeson County. By the end of the 19th century, the [...] "Indians of Robeson County" [...] (as they then identified) established schools in eleven of their principal settlements.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{music was}} not viewed favorably by most {{traditional}} and fundamentalist Christians {{when it became}} popular with young people from the 1950s, although early rock music was often influenced by country and gospel music. In 1952 Archibald Davison, a Harvard professor, summed up the sound of traditional Christian music and why its supporters may not like Rock music when he said: [...] "... a rhythm that avoids strong pulses; a melody whose physiognomy is neither so characteristic nor so engaging as to make an appeal in its own behalf; counterpoint, which cultivates long-breathed eloquence rather than instant and dramatic effect; a chromaticism which is at all times restricted in amount and lacking in emotionalism; and modality which creates an atmosphere unmistakably ecclesiastical." [...] Based upon Archibald Davison's statement {{it is easy to}} see how different these two genres of music are. [...] Religious people in many regions of the United States did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> exposed to music with unruly, impassioned vocals, loud guitar riffs and jarring, hypnotic rhythms. Rock and roll differed from the norm, and thus it was seen as a threat. Often the music was overtly sexual in nature, as in the case of Elvis Presley, who became controversial and massively popular partly for his suggestive stage antics and dancing. However, Elvis was a religious person who even released a gospel album: Peace in the Valley. Individual Christians may have listened to or even performed rock music in many cases, but it was seen as anathema to conservative church establishments, particularly in the American South.|$|E

50|$|One other {{significant}} {{development in the}} UK holiday cottage market is that of Farm Stays, driven partly by the farmers and the poor returns they get from farming itself, {{but also by the}} desire of parents <b>wanting</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to experience rural life first-hand.|$|R
60|$|It is {{infinitely}} {{easier to}} begin organised human affairs than end them; {{the curriculum and}} the social organisation of the English public school are the crowning instances of that. They go on because they have begun. Schools are not only immortal institutions but reproductive ones. Our founder, Jabez Arvon, knew nothing, I am sure, of Gates' pedagogic values and would, I feel certain, have dealt with them disrespectfully. But public schools and university colleges sprang into existence correlated, the scholars {{went on to the}} universities and came back to teach the schools, to teach as they themselves had been taught, before they had ever made any real use of the teaching; the crowd of boys herded together, a crowd perpetually renewed and unbrokenly the same, adjusted itself by means of spontaneously developed institutions. In a century, by its very success, this revolutionary innovation of Renascence public schools had become an immense tradition woven closely into the fabric of the national life. Intelligent and powerful people ceased to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but that only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point. Since most men of any importance or influence in the country had been through the mill, it was naturally a little difficult to persuade them that it was not quite the best and most ennobling mill the wit of man could devise. And, moreover, they did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> made strange to them. There was all the machinery and all the men needed to teach the old subjects, and none to teach whatever new the critic might propose. Such science instruction as my father gave seemed indeed the uninviting alternative to the classical grind. It was certainly an altogether inferior instrument at that time.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{qualitative}} study explored values, attitudes, and beliefs held by Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged children to enhance understanding of cultural influences on behaviors associated with childhood obesity risk. Methods: During face-to-face interviews, 39 Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged <b>children</b> discussed <b>their</b> hopes for <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>their</b> {{image of the}} perfect mother, Mexican and American foods, why they taught <b>their</b> <b>children</b> about these foods, and their opinions about television (TV) viewing language. Results: Participants <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to become successful, ?good? people, which necessitated doing well in school. Mothers also <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to know them, which required understanding the mothers' Mexican backgrounds. Mothers <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to maintain Mexican values and identities. Some mothers viewed American culture as harmful. Many participants prepared <b>their</b> <b>child</b> for going to Mexico by exposing them to Mexican culture and foods. Some mothers fed <b>their</b> <b>children</b> American foods {{to prepare them for}} school. Perceptions of American foods generally reflected stereotypical unhealthy foods. TV helped teach children Spanish and English. Being a good mother was core to participants' identities; thus, hearing about child overweight made some mothers feel like failures. Conclusions: Health promotion programs may be more salient to mothers if they: underscore how a healthy weight can help children in school; teach mothers to prepare healthy American foods that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> will encounter in kindergarten; assist mothers in teaching <b>their</b> <b>children</b> about Mexico; and present information about childhood obesity in ways that reinforce what mothers are doing well, enhance mothers' self-efficacy, and allay feelings of failure...|$|R
30|$|Quantitative studies {{subsequently}} {{sought to}} demonstrate that among working-class families, immigrant parents had much higher educational aspirations for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> than non-immigrant parents (Caille and O’Prey 2003, Brinbaum and Kieffer 2005). Caille and O’Prey’s study (2003) finds that more working-class immigrant parents, compared with working-class French-born parents, <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> to obtain an academic rather than a vocational secondary leaving certificate and {{to continue their education}} until age 20, and believe in the employment benefits of higher education. They have also more frequently specified that they <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> to enter the academic track in upper secondary school. Those results are stable “all other things being equal” 1 and are particularly true of families from the Maghreb, but also of families from sub-Saharan Africa and Turkey. These working-class immigrant families thus express more ambitious choices than working-class families where both parents are French-born.|$|R
