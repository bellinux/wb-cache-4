60|$|To start with, {{he places}} {{one of two}} identically {{constructed}} clocks at {{the centre of the}} circular disc, and the other {{on the edge of the}} disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the non-rotating Galileian reference-body K. As judged from this body, the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question.|$|E

We will meet a man who travels around the world with an uncanny robot, and listen to an artist in the process of inventing an interactive form for expressing grief through metaphysical dialogue. We will explore ideas of an entrepreneur who offers you a chance to live (symbolically) forever as an avatar, and we will focus on a hybrid eternity project, transforming rituals of memorising into forms that may speak more accurately to the mortals of the digital world. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> a never-ending conversation between two lovers.

40|$|The U. S. tax system, {{like most}} in the world, {{benefits}} capital gains in two ways. Investors can defer paying tax until they 2 ̆ 2 realize 2 ̆ 2 any gain (typically by sale) rather than when the gain simply occurs via rising prices. Additionally, individual investors pay a lower, preferred rate on their long-term capital gains as compared to their other ordinary income (such as compensation or business profits). However, investors face a burden {{with respect to their}} capital losses. Rather than allowing for unlimited capital loss deductions, the Code largely forces investors to match their capital losses against their capital gains. Limits on capital losses could be justified in several ways. The most prominent justification holds that taxpayers should not be able to 2 ̆ 2 cherry pick 2 ̆ 2 loss elements out of an overall winning portfolio. This Article seeks to clarify the nature of the cherry-picking argument.

However, forced matching comes at a cost, as it will deny loss deductions to investors who have suffered true losses. Again, option theory gives us a method for estimating these costs and-more importantly-comparing them to the costs of loss harvesting.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} I {{want to show}} some {{advantages}} of the Geometric Iteration to a possible study of a predator-prey system. The Geometric Iteration presents characteristics such as continuity, derivability and integrability which could allow to analyze when a predator can still reach it is prey even when the prey has a initial advantage. AMS (MOS) Subject Classification. 26 A 18. 1. PRELIMINARIES I can start assuming a predator-prey system whose motivation was the model established in [4]. We can suppose that two animals make {{the same number of}} jumps or strides per minute, but one of them makes bigger jumps than the other. Also, both animals are encouraged or discouraged. The lenght of the initial jump of the predator is b and its factor of encouragement is q, while the lenght of the initial jump of the prey is a and its factor of encouragement is p, but both of them have periods of run m and l respectively. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> a planet in which the predators and the preys move by jumps of incremental or decremental longitude using the Geometric Iteration, which will be defined below. We could consider a, b ∈ R+ = R+ ∪ { 0 },m, l ∈ Z+ = Z+ ∪ { 0 }, p, q ∈ R, but only we will discuss some special cases. In some cases, we assume that the prey has k steps ahead of the predator as initial advantage; in other cases, it is said that both animals are persistent all times no matter if our prey has an initial advantage. We will work at the second case and we will give the following definition to determine one kind of displacement, velocity or aceleration of the creatures. Definition 1. 1. Given a ∈ R+, p ∈ R, |a|+|p | 6 = 0, define the first geometric of p on a by G(p, 1) (a) = ap.

40|$|Märksim is {{a virtual}} model train set. The program will {{implement}} the Märklin digital interface {{so that it can}} be controlled by external programs. In particular, the Fall 2008 CS 452 project draxos will be used to control the trains. Märksim will present a 3 D display of the trains moving along a track whose layout will be one of the two track layouts in MC 3018. The program interface will support the usual operations one does on a model train set – adding or removing trains from the track, manual control of sensors, switches or the trains themselves. Since this is a graphics project, most of the emphasis will be on the actual display of the trains on the track. The primary focus is on making rectangular prisms (the trains) move realistically around a curve (the track). Ancillary features include a nice surrounding environment and lighting. The terrain and trains should be shadowed reasonably by sunlight. I believe this project is interesting because I have done very little OpenGL programming in the past, and the project consists of a reasonably complex scene as well as animation of moving trains and shadow techniques. The project also has use beyond the course in that it allows us to run our realtime projects outside of MC 3018 (which can’t even be done anymore since the machines in that lab have been replaced). Several members of my Fall 2008 CS 452 class in this one, I hope that my project can support their train programs as well. I also like the idea of merging projects from two of the most programming-heavy upper year CS courses at this university. Technical Outline The serial protocol interface itself will be implemented using BSD ptys. This closely emulates a serial port. Furthermore, Qemu can interact with it, easily allowing CS 452 projects to communicate with the trains. To simulate trains moving along a track, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> trains as being rectangular prisms with 2 points “locked ” to the centre of the track. Then the problem of determining train location and velocity is reduced to finding chords of a particular length along the curve that represents the track layout. Collisions require computing the intersection of two rectangular prisms. Wheel pivots will require computing tangent lines to the curve. The relative magnitudes of the wheel pivots will also affect velocity and can be used to detect certain cases of derailment...|$|E

Henceforth these objects <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> as matrix of operators that acts in the complex Hilbert space H. In a case GL(∞) suppose, that basis {e 1,e 2, [...] .,en, [...] . } of H is numerated by the elements from N, and en is an infinite row with the unique nonzero n-th coordinate that equals to unit. Let B(H) be a set of bounded operators in H, GL(H) = {g ∈ B(H) : there exist g − 1 ∈ B(H) },GL(n) = {g ∈ GL(H) : gei = g ∗ ei = ei for all i> n}, and GL(∞) is an inductive limit of the groups GL(n) (n = 1, 2, 3, [...] .). To definite Sp(2 ∞),O(2 ∞) let’s consider in H orthonormal basis { [...] .,e−n, [...] .,e− 2,e− 1,e 1,e 2, [...] .,en, [...] . } and represent H in the form H = H − ⊕ H+, where H − and H+ are generated by basis elements with the negative and positive numbers respectively. We put GL(2 n) = {g ∈ GL(H) : gei = g ∗ ei = ei, if |i |> n} and define operators s+ and s − in H by the formulae: s+ei = e−i,s−ei = (sign i) e−i. Let GL(2 ∞) be an inductive limit of GL(2 n), Sp(2 ∞) (O(2 ∞)) = {g ∈ GL(2 ∞) : s−g t s − 1 − = g − 1 (s+g t s+ = g − 1) }, where g t is a transposed matrix with respect to g.

40|$|Russia’s {{annexation}} of Crimea met with widespread condemnation among international lawyers. And {{it could not}} have been otherwise. Russian behavior in the Crimean crisis epitomizes the kind of power politics which is deadly to international law. As a consequence, international law scholarship has tended to look down on legal arguments employed by Russia and Crimean irredentists to support their case, including the one leveraging on self-determination. This is indeed regrettable because the majority of the Crimean population seemed to be in favor of annexation to Russia. Such an element (of course, controversial) should have prompted greater respect for the self-determination argument. On these assumptions, we intend to investigate whether the Crimean claim for self-determination has any basis in international law. However, since we believe that Russian coercive intervention inevitably distorted the legal framework of this crisis (by turning it into a “use of force” issue) and seriously undermined the international reputation of the Crimean cause, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>imagine</b> an alternative scenario where such an intervention never took place. In other words, we will try to figure out whether – in the absence of forcible outside interference – the will expressed by Crimean institutions and its people to (re) unite with Russia would have had some weight under international law. Mainstream scholarship answered in the negative, on the two-fold ground that the Crimean case a) did not fit with any of the legitimate hypotheses of self-determination codified by international practice, i. e. colonial/alien/racist domination; b) did not meet the conditions required by the “remedial secession” doctrine. This is because these authors look at the principle of self-determination as a “rule”, whose content has been crystallized through the combination of state practice and opinio juris. In our opinion, the main problem with this view lies in its failure to consider that the principle of self-determination is inherently indeterminate. Accordingly, in order to draw from it concrete precepts, a policy-oriented choice is always required. This inevitably raises a string of questions. Who takes part in such a decision-making process? How is the latter carried out? What substantive principles direct the choices of decision-maker(s) ? Our working hypothesis is that, in the quest for a solution to these queries, a valuable contribution may be offered by the policy-oriented jurisprudence of the New Haven School (NHS), whose focus on the dynamics of the law-making “process” is widely known. This would be beneficial in many respects. First, it would allow bringing to the limelight the role played by non-state entities (such as local institutions and insurgents movements) which, while not enjoying formal status of international subjects, have a non-negligible say in self-determination processes. Second, by questioning the “sanctity” of past trends, NHS frees the principle of self-determination from its glorious (but outdated) anti-colonialist past and paves the way for an overall rethinking of what constitutes a legitimate self-determination claim. Third, since it is strongly committed to normative values, NHS does not equate international law with the will of superpowers, but provides a critical framework through which the latter’s international behavior may be scrutinized...|$|E
40|$|Jesus offers Abundant Life yet so many Christians {{settle for}} less. Why? There are myriad {{theories}} {{as to what}} constitutes Abundant Life (AL). As the evidence of history and Scripture are integrated, AL is consistently experienced in three realities: relationship, responsibility and restoration (RE 3). Relationship + Responsibility + Restoration = Abundant Life or R 3 AL. R 3 AL Life existed in Creation, was made accessible to Fallen Eikons 1 through Jesus and will be central to New Creation. While many Christians are aware of why they were created and the transformational power of Jesus, R 3 AL life eludes them. They have a flawed eschatology that leads to floundering humanity. For many Christians, their ultimate hope is escape from this world to a better life in heaven. This evacuation eschatology directly affects {{their quality of life}} today. They have failed to recognize the essential relationship between quality of life and eschatological hope. How, then, do one 2 ̆ 7 s hopes and expectations for the future enhance or encumber their ability to experience Abundant Life now? I contend that Christians can experience Abundant Life now through reclamation of relationship and responsibility in the hope of restoration. Chapter 1 will explore the essential connection between telos and hope. The nature of one 2 ̆ 7 s telos and hope lead to either floundering or flourishing. One 2 ̆ 7 s telos matters. It directly affects one 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life here and now. Hence our problem: a flawed eschatology will contribute to a floundering humanity. Chapter 2 will go back to the beginning to distill the essential components of flourishing for human beings. Throughout the biblical narrative, we will discover the elements of relationship, responsibility and restoration as essential to the experience of Abundant Life. Chapter 3 will explore the echoes of relationship, responsibility and restoration in historical sources beyond the biblical narrative. As we delve into the continuum of philosophers, behavioral scientists and historians, we will see the essential nature of human flourishing echoing the biblical narrative 2 ̆ 7 s clarion call to R 3 AL life. Chapter 4 is dedicated to uncovering the flawed eschatology that unwittingly contributes to floundering humanity. We will see how a flawed definition of justice has produced an escape and retribution eschatology with dire consequences. Then, from Revelation 19, we will present a view of justice which points to the restoration of all things.
