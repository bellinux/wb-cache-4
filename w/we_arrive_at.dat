25|$|If the {{distance}} function takes {{values in the}} extended real number line R∪{+∞}, but otherwise satisfies all four conditions, then it is called an extended metric and the corresponding space is called an -metric space. If {{the distance}} function takes values in some (suitable) ordered set (and the triangle inequality is adjusted accordingly), then <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the notion of generalized ultrametric.|$|E
25|$|By {{taking the}} limit of the {{expression}} as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the Riemann integral.

25|$|Let the {{non-empty}} set S be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, {{every element}} of S has a non-empty intersection with S.

As this is an infinite descending chain, <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> a contradiction and so, no such S exists.|$|E

25|$|The GEAC cleared Bt brinjal for commercialization on 14 October 2009. Following {{concerns}} {{raised by}} some scientists, farmers and anti-GMO activists, {{the government of}} India officially announced on 9 February 2010 that it needed more time before releasing Bt brinjal, with Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh {{saying that there is}} no overriding urgency to introduce Bt brinjal in India. On 17 February 2010, Jairam Ramesh reiterated that the Centre had only imposed a moratorium on the release of transgenic brinjal hybrid, and not a permanent ban, saying that “until <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> a political, scientific and societal consensus, this moratorium will remain”. Companies with any seeds of Bt brinjal will have to register the details with the government, and the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) was made responsible for storage of all the Bt brinjal seeds in India. Independent testing labs are currently being set up.|$|E

On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested me is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated me is the way <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
