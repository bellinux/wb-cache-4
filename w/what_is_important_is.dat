5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

[...] Norbert Mao, Ugandan politician and president of the opposition Democratic Party, stated his support for the film, explaining that while it does have some problems, such as implying Ugandans did not try to fight back against the LRA and not explaining how many of the issues in the film were also exacerbated by the Ugandan government itself, the film is still a [...] "positive development" [...] for the issue, adding that while Invisible Children may not be [...] "the foremost analysts of the complicated political, historical and security dynamics" [...] in the situation, [...] "they have the most beautiful trait on earth -- compassion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The History thus met a mixed {{critical}} response – [...] "praise, misgivings and puzzlement {{in varying}} proportions" [...] – but a generally positive public one. Most readers warmed to Clark's great gift for narrative prose and {{the depiction of}} individual character, and were not troubled by the comments of academic critics on his factual inaccuracies or their doubts about his historiographic theories. The books sold extremely well and were a major earner for Melbourne University Press (MUP) and its director, Peter Ryan. Even critics who found fault with the History as history admired it as literature. In The Age, Stuart Sayers hailed it as [...] "a major work, not only of scholarship... but also of Australian literature". Some reviewers complained that Clark was [...] "too pre-occupied with tragic vision" [...] or condemned his [...] "Biblical and slightly mannered style", but [...] "recognised that Clark's very excesses gave the History its profundity and distinctive insight". The respected historian John La Nauze, author of a highly regarded biography of Alfred Deakin, wrote {{that the importance of}} Clark's work [...] "lies not in the apocalyptic vision of our history... which I do not understand, and which I am sure I would disagree with if I did," [...] but in [...] "the particular flashes of interpretation" [...] which gave [...] "a new appearance to familiar features". Alastair Davidson stated in a review in the magazine Dissent in 1968: [...] "The astonishing savaging of volume one of A History of Australia, when it appeared in 1962, seems almost symbolic. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> that such pettiness did not harm such as Gibbon and Taine.
