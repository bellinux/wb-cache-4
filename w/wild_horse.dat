5|$|Although {{there is}} an {{apparent}} absence of horse remains between 7000BC and 3500BC, {{there is evidence that}} wild horses remained in Britain after it became an island separate from Europe by about 5,500BC.

5|$|The tarpan or European <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> (Equus ferus ferus) {{was found}} in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the {{historical}} era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost.

Management of <b>wild</b> <b>horses</b> and burros has long been controversial.

The United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) addresses management of wild free-roaming horses and burros at 36 CFR 222 Subpart B.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} hypotheses {{exist on}} the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> origin is thought improbable, as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800–1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E

5000|$|The river {{may have}} been first called the River of the <b>Wild</b> <b>Horses</b> back in 1833 by {{botanist}} David Douglas. The river was given its current name in 1871. The word Marron is French and it has several meanings. One of them is [...] "domestic animal that has become wild". According to Mrs. William Allen and Mr. F. M. Buckland, a lot of <b>wild</b> <b>horses</b> roamed {{the area around the}} river, which is likely why the river was given the name it was in reference to the <b>wild</b> <b>horses</b> that roamed the surrounding terrain.|$|R
5|$|Feral {{horses are}} {{documented}} as {{living in the}} Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, although {{they may have been}} there since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of feral horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock to graze the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed.|$|E
5|$|The BLM {{management}} of the herd has included improvements to the range to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that {{have resulted in the}} removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, and another 44 in 2012. In 2015, a plan was approved to gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the contraceptive vaccine the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. The Pryor Mountains <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> Range {{is one of the most}} accessible areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area has increased in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland herd, {{often called}} the Assateague herd, is owned and managed by the National Park Service. The Maryland herd is one of very few free-ranging <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> populations left in the United States. This, {{combined}} with its presence on a relatively small and naturally confined area, has made it ideal for scientific study. Since the late 1970s, scientists have used the herd to conduct studies on feral horse behavior, social structure, ecology, remote contraceptive delivery and pregnancy testing, {{and the effects of}} human intervention on other wild animal populations. There are few other wildlife populations of any species worldwide that have been studied in as much detail over as long a period as the Maryland herd of Chincoteague ponies.|$|E

5|$|The tarpan was a Eurasian <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> {{that became}} extinct {{in the wild}} in 1879, due to hunting and {{crossbreeding}} with domesticated horses, and in 1887 the last captive horse died in Russia. The Heck horse {{was created by the}} German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by a breeder named Harry Hegardt.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> of doubts who run in the mind of a person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E

5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The Manipuri pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{developed}} in India. Experts disagree on its exact origin, {{although they do}} {{agree that it is}} an ancient breed, possibly developed from either the Tibetan pony or a cross between the Mongolian <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> and the Arabian. First mentioned in written chronicles in 1584, Manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were in demand by the British for use as polo ponies. Breed numbers have dwindled, however, mainly due to exports, and today the population is very low. In 2007, a genetic study was conducted on the Manipuri and four other Indian equine breeds. The Manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other Indian pony breeds, but genetically more distant from the Marwari, the sole Indian horse breed in the study. The Manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage, and today is bred mainly for playing polo and racing, although it is also in demand for military transport use.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved {{to be anything but}} cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E
