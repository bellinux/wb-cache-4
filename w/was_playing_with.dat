5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} when Henry died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king's body to the castle of Tariego, although {{it was inevitable that}} the news would reach Berengaria.|$|E
5|$|In June 1888, Lord Harris played {{twice for}} Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt {{was out of}} form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match. In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of Bournemouth against the Parsees cricket team during their tour of England, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings. Nevertheless, the Parsees won. On 8 September 1888, the Blackheath Club played against the Christopherson {{brothers}}. Druitt was bowled out by Stanley Christopherson, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> his brothers instead of for Blackheath, and in reply Druitt bowled out Christopherson. Blackheath won by 22 runs.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland again {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in 1951, but lost this time in a rematch against the Rams. Groza had a 52-yard field goal in the game, a record for a championship or Super Bowl that stood for 42 years. He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season. The same scenario was repeated in 1952 and 1953: the Browns reached the championship both years, but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Groza <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> cracked ribs in the 1952 championship loss, and he missed three field goals. Groza set a record in 1953 when he made 23 field goals and had an 88.5% success rate, a single-season mark that stood for 28 years. He made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 and 1953, and was a first-team All-Pro selection both years.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} was a let down year {{not only for}} Durant {{but also for the}} Roughriders as a whole. The Riders stumbled out of the gate losing seven of their first eight games. Durant's production fell significantly through the course of the season. Near {{the end of the season}} Durant <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a broken bone in his foot, which ultimately lead to him missing the last two games of the regular season. The Riders would finish the year with only 5 wins and 13 loses, placing them in last place in the league. Despite the reduced production in 2011 on April 27, 2012 the Riders extended his contract through the 2014 CFL season.|$|E
5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he would be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E

Brazil <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> its second-string team and this victory could be considered an underdog one.|$|E

In 1875, for instance, he performed alongside Emma and Anna Hyer in Out of Bondage, a musical {{drama about a}} freed slave who is made over to fit into upper-class, white society. He followed this by another stint in black minstrelsy, and in 1876, he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> Sprague's Georgia Minstrels, alongside both James A. Bland and Billy Kersands.|$|E

Despite leading the playoffs in scoring through the first three rounds, Kovalchuk <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a herniated disc and was largely ineffective against the Los Angeles Kings, scoring just {{one point in the}} series, an empty-net goal in Game 4, as the Devils fell to the Kings in six games.|$|E

In the third period, the Blackhawks' Patrick Kane scored on a pass from Brad Richards and play by Brandon Saad to put the 'Hawks ahead 2–0, the first two-goal lead of the series. The Blackhawks then frustrated the Lightning the rest of the way to win the game 2–0, a shutout for Crawford and the Stanley Cup championship. It was revealed after the game that the Lightning's goaltender Ben Bishop had played with a torn groin muscle since game two and Tyler Johnson <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a fractured wrist, injured in game one.
