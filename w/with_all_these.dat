5|$|Henry {{presented}} {{himself as the}} legitimate heir to Henry I and commenced rebuilding the kingdom in his image. Although Stephen had tried to continue Henry I's method of government during his reign, the younger Henry's new government characterised those nineteen years as a chaotic and troubled period, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> problems resulting from Stephen's usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show that, unlike his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others. Various measures were immediately carried out although, since Henry spent {{six and a half}} years out of the first eight years of his reign in France, much work had to be done at a distance. The process of demolishing the unauthorised castles from the war continued. Efforts were made to restore the system of royal justice and the royal finances. Henry also invested heavily in the construction and renovation of prestigious new royal buildings.|$|E

25|$|In late 1778, British {{strategy}} shifted south. As {{their attention}} went, so too did their efforts, their armies, and their supplies, including those slated for the Southern Indians. The Southern theater had the added {{advantage of being}} home to more Loyalists than the North. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> new advantages, the Cherokee were able to greatly renew their territorial defense.

25|$|Having {{returned}} from Bucharest Mijatović became {{for the fifth}} time Finance Minister in the Government of Milutin Garašanin in 1886/1887. Finally in 1887/1889 he was for the second time Foreign Minister in the Government of Nikola Hristić (Hristić). In this capacity he signed renewal of the Secret Convention. However, the decision of King Milan to abdicate on March 6, 1889 effectively ended his special position at the Court. The new government encouraged persecution {{of the members of the}} Progressive Party. Faced <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> failures he decided to leave Serbia and withdrew to Britain in September 1889.|$|E
25|$|With three legends (Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Dilshan) {{retired from}} {{international}} cricket, {{the team had}} a rough time in many bilateral series in all formats. They also lost Asia Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy very cheaply and moved down to 8 ad 7 places in rankings as well. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>these,</b> Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka and drawn all formats, whereas Zimbabwe also recorded their first series win against Sri Lanka and the captaincy of Mathews was criticized for many reasons for their losses. Though he injured several times in his captaincy career, and replaced by Upul Tharanga in many winning notes, reporters suggested that Mathews will not captain until 2019 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discovery}} at Manson's Creek in July of '71, more large strikes {{were made on}} nearby creeks. Among these were Blackjack Creek, Kildare Creek, Mosquito Creek, Slate Creek and Nugget Gulch. One of this richest creeks was found by accident by James Carson, H. Guest and J Griffith, who had gotten lost while looking for Manson's Creek and literally stumbled across it, thus they called it Lost Creek. The very first panful taken from Lost Creek yielded 3/4 of an ounce of gold. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> new strikes in the district, new towns sprang up practically overnight: Manson's Creek, Howellton and Dunkeld. The residence of the Gold Commissioner's would be built at Dunkeld. There would be three Gold Commissioners for the Omineca district in the 1870s and they were, Peter O'Reilly, WH Fitzgerald and D. Ballentyne, who would also act as Stipendary Magistrates.|$|E

25|$|Still, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not {{encourage}} individual fasting. The community in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, {{and it was}} the duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the growing}} tide of {{revolution}} was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda {{ample opportunity to}} leave the country before revolutionary forces could {{have had a chance to}} overthrow the 2500-year-old monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends {{to leave the country}} as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and that everything would eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.|$|E
25|$|His history textbook, {{the first}} Marxist {{synthesis}} of Romanian history, appeared in 1947, in one edition for advanced pupils {{and another for}} younger ones. It portrayed the country's history {{through the lens of}} Marxist stages of history: primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism, advancing all the while through class struggle. Initially called Istoria României ("The History of Romania") but later Istoria R.P.R. ("The History of the R P R"), it appeared between 1947 and 1956 and was used until the 1961–1962 school year. Appearing very quickly ("in record time", according to Mihai Stoian), it was not written from scratch by Roller and his collaborators, but rather used documents from the PCR's period of illegality, especially the theses adopted by the fifth party congress held near Moscow in 1931, which criticized the 1859 union, the 1918 union, the constitutional government, democratic reforms, the monarchy, parliamentarism, the activity of the historic parties' leaders and foreign policy, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> criticisms entering the textbook.|$|E
