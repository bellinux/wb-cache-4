3000|$|Iodine {{value of}} {{synthesized}} biodiesel was investigated by <b>Wijs</b> <b>method.</b> This value was expressed in grams of iodine {{for the amount}} of halogens bonded with 100  g of biodiesel sample. The iodine value of synthesized biodiesel was calculated from titration volume of sodium thiosulfate solution. Maximum value of iodine value according to the standard is 115 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{palm oil}} as non-drying oil owing to its low iodine value, an attempt {{was taken to}} {{increase}} the unsaturation in the fatty acid chains of palm oil for the preparation of alkyds. To increase the unsaturation in the palm oil, sulphuric acid (SA) and para-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) was used prior to alcoholysis for the dehydration process. The iodine number of the oil samples was checked for the unsaturation measurement by <b>Wijs</b> <b>method.</b> Alkyd resin was prepared using the dehydrated palm oil by following alcoholysis and esterification reaction. To improve the film properties 0. 5 wt. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{analyses of}} the neem oil biodiesel were carried out using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods [25]. The analyses carried out include pour point determination (ASTM method), cloud point determination (ASTM), flash point determination (ASTM D 93) using Pensky-Martens flash point tester, refractive index determination (using ATAGO Refractometer, RX- 5000 CX, Tokyo, Japan), specific gravity using specific gravity bottle according to AOAC method [25]), moisture content [25], viscosity (using Rion viscometer VTO 4 F, Netherlands), acid value [25], iodine value by <b>Wijs</b> <b>method</b> [25], peroxide value [25], saponification value [25], higher heating value (HHV) determination calculated model developed by Demirbas and Kara [26], cetane number (CN) determination using correlation reported by Patel [27] and Krisnangkura [28].|$|E
40|$|Chloramine T (N-chloro-p-toluenesulfonamide sodium salt) and iodine (2 : 1, w/w) {{in carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} and acetic acid (1 : 1, vol/vol), {{referred to as}} reagent (I) {{was found to be}} effective for the determination of Iodine value of edible oils. Reagent (I) reacted quantitatively with the double bonds of oils of known weight. The reagent left unreacted after 20 – 25 min was titrated against standard sodium thiosulfate solution (0. 04 M) in presence of potassium iodide (10 %, 5 mL). The difference in volume of sodium thiosulfate solution consumed by reagent (I) without and with oil was a basis to calculate the iodine value of oils used. The iodine values of different oils were also determined separately following the standard procedure of Wijs, and calculated iodine value was obtained from the gas chromatographic profile of fatty acids. The iodine value obtained by the new method was in agreement with the results of the standard methods. The results obtained indicate that the method could be a complementary or an alternative to the <b>Wijs</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E
