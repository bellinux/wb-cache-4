40|$|BACKGROUND: Providing {{emergency}} department (ED) <b>wait</b> time {{information to the}} public has been suggested as a mechanism to reduce lengthy ED <b>wait</b> times (by enabling patients to select the ED site with shorter <b>wait</b> time), but the effects of such a program have not been evaluated. We evaluated the effects of such a program in a community with two ED sites. METHODS: Descriptive statistics for <b>wait</b> times of the two sites before and after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information were used to evaluate the effects of the publication of <b>wait</b> time information on <b>wait</b> times. Multivariate logistical regression was used to test whether or not individual patients used published <b>wait</b> time to decide which site to visit. RESULTS: We found that the rates of <b>wait</b> times exceeding 4 h, and the 95 th percentile of <b>wait</b> times in the two sites decreased after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information, even though the average <b>wait</b> times experienced a slight increase. We also found that after controlling for other factors, the site with shorter <b>wait</b> time had a higher likelihood of being selected after the publication of <b>wait</b> time information, but there was no such relationship before the publication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the publication of <b>wait</b> time information leads to patients selecting the site with shorter <b>wait</b> time. While publishing ED <b>wait</b> time information did not improve average <b>wait</b> time, it reduced the rates of lengthy <b>wait</b> times...|$|R

By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had <b>waiting</b> rooms and agents. The stations without <b>waiting</b> rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone <b>waiting</b> at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E

40|$|Consumer <b>wait</b> {{situations}} such {{as being}} put on hold during a telephone call require the consumer to make continuous decisions on whether to stay on line and receive service or terminate the current <b>wait</b> and reinitiate a new <b>wait.</b> The key question that is addressed in my dissertation is how do consumers decide how long to <b>wait</b> and when to renege? I expect that going into a <b>wait</b> situation consumers are likely to hold optimistic priors about <b>wait</b> completions. Further, as the <b>wait</b> progresses, rational instincts to stay during the <b>wait</b> are increasingly likely {{to be affected by}} various psychological factors such as emotional cost of the <b>wait,</b> uncertainty about the <b>wait,</b> perceptions about likely length of future <b>wait</b> {{and the extent to which}} prior <b>wait</b> expectations are violated. The net effect is that I expect consumers to abandon <b>waits</b> when they perceive the utility of the current <b>wait</b> net of the psychological factors as less than that associated with starting a new <b>wait.</b> I study renege decisions in contexts where it is never optimal to renege and in contexts where it is optimal to renege within a small window of time and show that consumer decisions to renege are far from optimal and are likely driven by psychological factors. Further, I show how moderators such as activity within a <b>wait,</b> often used as time management strategies by marketers, are likely to affect decisions to stay or renege. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Total <b>wait</b> {{time for}} total joint {{replacement}} surgery is described, and comorbidities and health service utilization of patients during the <b>wait</b> {{and length of}} stay after the procedure are examined. [...] Methods: Surgery department data for 2002 - 2005 from eastern Newfoundland and Labrador was linked to physician claims and hospital data to measure total <b>wait</b> time and examine health service utilization and comorbidities. <b>Wait</b> time was grouped into short, moderate, long and very long. [...] Results: Median total <b>wait</b> time was 47. 1 months. Age, hospitalizations and new comorbidities during the <b>wait</b> time were positively associated with length of stay after the replacement. No association was found between total <b>wait</b> time and physician visits or hospitalizations. A weak positive association was found between number of comorbidities and <b>wait</b> time. [...] Conclusions: Patients <b>wait</b> times are longest before the <b>wait</b> list begins. It may be beneficial to both patients and the health system to reduce the total <b>wait</b> time...|$|R

5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the <b>waiting</b> room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended <b>waiting</b> area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost Â£3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing Â£100,000 towards the new <b>waiting</b> room and help desk.|$|E
