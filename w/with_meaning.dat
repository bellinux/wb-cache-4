5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of Svadhyaya as a Niyama is perfected in many forms. One form of Svadhyaya is mantra meditation, where certain sound constructs pregnant <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> are recited, anchoring {{the mind to}} one thought. This practice helps draw the mind away from outward-going tendencies, silencing the crowding of thoughts, and ultimately towards inward feeling of resonance. It can alternately be any music, sermon, chant, inspirational book that absorbs the person {{to a state of}} absorption, trance, unifying oneness.|$|E
25|$|Archetypal {{literary}} criticism argues that archetypes determine {{the form and}} function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as the trickster or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> when employed in a particular work.|$|E
25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly {{what is necessary to}} compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of what we are saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1891 Schiller had {{independently}} reached a doctrine {{very similar to}} William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation {{is to make the}} same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.|$|E
500|$|Several songs used in {{the film}} are laden <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> At one point Mayhew stumbles away from Barton and Audrey, drunk. As he wanders, he hollers the folk song [...] "Old Black Joe" [...] (1853). Composed by Stephen Foster, it tells the tale of an elderly slave {{preparing}} to join his friends in [...] "a better land". Mayhew's rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of Capitol Pictures, and it foreshadows Barton's own situation at the movie's end.|$|E

Central to his canon {{and one of}} Auden's finest poems, {{it has been the}} subject of diverse {{scholarly}} interpretations. Auden's limestone landscape has been interpreted as an allegory of Mediterranean civilization and of the human body. The poem, sui generis, is not easily classified. As a topographical poem, it describes a landscape and infuses it <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> It has been called the [...] "first… postmodern pastoral". In a letter, Auden wrote of limestone and the poem's theme that [...] "that rock creates the only human landscape." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything {{that goes on in}} this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The {{classification}} {{was originally}} enumerative, {{meaning that it}} listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + [...]9 for geographic treatment + [...]04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + [...]05 for periodical publications on the topic {{to arrive at the}} number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification synthetic in nature, <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> built into parts of the classification number.|$|E
500|$|Justin Joffe, {{writing for}} the New York Observer, praised the album as [...] "a {{stunning}} display of naked vulnerability and a notable achievement ... Radiohead remain dedicated craftsmen of strange new sonic universes."

[...] Mike Diver of the Quietus, however, felt the inclusion of older songs gave the album the unwelcome feeling of a compilation album, writing: [...] "Certain tracks feel less than fully fleshed out, really given the treatment that their age warrants ... There's simply so little spark here, barely glowing embers and blackened dust where once Radiohead blazed a fascinating, furious trail for others to attempt to follow." ...|$|E

500|$|Anime News Network's Jonathan Mays criticized Steven Foster's dubbing of the film. He said, [...] "Foster {{carelessly}} omits critical details, completely rewrites some scenes, misinterprets emotions, {{and even}} adds new dialogue where the original track had silence". In an Anime News Network interview, Foster said he [...] "made some changes {{to make the}} jokes more accessible". Mays also said, [...] "The animation is breathtaking. Shinkai's backgrounds have very few equals. The character designs look uninspired, but paired with the animator's beautifully realized worlds, the generic appearance fades into the magnificence of the scene." [...] He said Shinkai's use of lighting is [...] "masterful", [...] "incredibly realistic" [...] and conveys the characters' moods well. He called the characters [...] "unoriginal". DVD Verdict's Rob Lineberger commended the music, saying [...] "the simple score infuses the animation <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> Solitary piano notes are sluggish, as though the pianist lacked the enthusiasm needed {{to pick up his}} fingers. When the action kicks in, it arrives with a sonic punch from 5.1 speakers. Rockets scream around you, birds move overhead, engines thrum quietly in your wake.

500|$|The episode {{has been}} well {{received}} by reviewers. TV Guide ranked it No. 7 on its list of the ten best Star Trek episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Tasha's determination to die <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> by the end of [...] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad." [...] In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a [...] "TV death" [...] is the episode's major flaw: [...] "It is, in short, a scripted death, {{and you can see the}} marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is [...] "heavy, PhilipK. Dick-ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow and... all victories come at a cost", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, Den of Geek reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories.|$|E
500|$|So is Gabriel's first non-eponymous album. Gabriel {{has noted}} his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an {{interview}} for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So [...] " [...] {{decided to go for}} the anti-title... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> and intention. And that's what I've done ever since". When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, {{it was meant to be}} entitled Good. The sleeve design is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973). It was then designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was most known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists. Saville was paid £20,000 for his design. Gabriel has since commented: [...] "the only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 46 reviews. Garry Mulholland of Uncut dubbed it a [...] "masterpiece", while Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen hailed the xx as [...] "masters of restraint". In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot {{felt that the}} album [...] "functions as a near-perfect mood piece" [...] and, [...] "because {{there are so few}} elements in each song," [...] each sound [...] "makes a bigger impact." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick praised Smith for [...] "somehow widening and deepening the sound without intruding", while Puja Patel of Spin magazine credited him for [...] "both stretching and magnifying the gritty beauty of his vocalists". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau complimented their preoccupation with [...] "young love" [...] and stated, [...] "these scrupulously abstract verses capture its obsessive doubts and fragile exaltations with delicacy and tenderness." [...] Michael Alan Goldberg of The Village Voice called the album [...] "gorgeous" [...] and said that the music is like a [...] "haiku instead of sonnet; Hemingway rather than Fitzgerald, <b>with</b> <b>meaning</b> and emotion lurking beneath the surface." [...] Simon Price found the group's take on the duet concept highly engaging and emotional while deeming Coexist a greater work than their debut album.|$|E
500|$|The {{poems in}} Ariel mark a {{departure}} from her earlier work into a more personal arena of poetry. Robert Lowell's poetry {{may have played a}} part in this shift as she cited Lowell's 1959 book Life Studies as a significant influence, in an interview just before her death. Posthumously published in 1966, the impact of Ariel was dramatic, with its dark and potentially autobiographical descriptions of mental illness in poems such as '"Tulips", [...] "Daddy" [...] and [...] "Lady Lazarus". Plath's work is often held within the genre of confessional poetry and the style of her work compared to other contemporaries, such as Robert Lowell and W.D. Snodgrass. Plath's close friend Al Alvarez, who has written about her extensively, said of her later work: [...] "Plath's case is complicated by the fact that, in her mature work, she deliberately used the details of her everyday life as raw material for her art. A casual visitor or unexpected telephone call, a cut, a bruise, a kitchen bowl, a candlestick—everything became usable, charged <b>with</b> <b>meaning,</b> transformed. Her poems are full of references and images that seem impenetrable at this distance, but which could mostly be explained in footnotes by a scholar with full access to the details of her life." [...] Many of Plath's later poems deal with what one critic calls the [...] "domestic surreal" [...] in which Plath takes everyday elements of life and twists the images, giving them an almost nightmarish quality. Plath's poem [...] "Morning Song" [...] from Ariel is {{regarded as one of the}} twentieth century's finest poems concerning an artist's freedom of expression.|$|E
500|$|Given {{only the}} artwork and outline {{to work with}} during production, writer Yoshinori Kitase felt that one early scene of Kefka's {{approach}} of a castle was too [...] "boring to make completely normal" [...] and decided to ad-lib a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers dust off his boots {{in the middle of}} a desert. The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there [...] "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head". He has been described as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for delegating his authority. He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners. As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word [...] "hate" [...] to his enemies. He is also very sadistic, taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming. This is especially evident when he poisons Doma, as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process. In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life <b>with</b> <b>meaning.</b> Final Fantasy VI features a song called [...] "Kefka", which exemplifies the [...] "sadistic joy" [...] of the character. His laughter has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time.|$|E
