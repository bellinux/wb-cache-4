25|$|For the Abhidharmikas, {{truth was}} twofold {{and there are}} two ways of looking at reality. One way is the way of {{everyday}} experience and of normal worldly persons. This is the category of the nominal and the conceptual (paññatti), and is termed the conventional truth (saṃvṛti-satya). However, the way of the Abhidharma, and hence the way of enlightened persons like the Buddha, who have developed the true insight (vipassana), sees reality as the constant stream of collections of dharmas, and this <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the world is ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya).|$|E
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> themselves and their environment.|$|E
25|$|One major {{application}} of the matrix theory is calculation of determinants, a central concept in linear algebra. While determinants could be defined in a basis-free manner, they are usually introduced via a specific representation of the mapping; {{the value of the}} determinant does not depend on the specific basis. It turns out that a mapping has an inverse if and only if the determinant has an inverse (every non-zero real or complex number has an inverse). If the determinant is zero, then the nullspace is nontrivial. Determinants have other applications, including a systematic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> if a set of vectors is linearly independent (we write the vectors as the columns of a matrix, and if the determinant of that matrix is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent). Determinants could also be used to solve systems of linear equations (see Cramer's rule), but in real applications, Gaussian elimination is a faster method.|$|E

500|$|The {{landscape}} {{paintings of}} Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind (18191891) influenced both Boudin and Monet {{and contributed to}} the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in Sainte-Adresse in 1862, Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for local color. [...] "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," [...] Monet later reminisced. [...] "It was he who completed the education of my eye". This new <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing,</b> a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's Haystacks (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single haystack motif.|$|E
500|$|Baxter {{notes that}} Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous {{attention}} to detail, often demanding {{twenty or thirty}} retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, [...] the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Most notably, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA {{to be used in}} satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a [...] "sense of documentary realism and immediacy".|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> things." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Murray, in {{addition}} to their shared abandonment issues, Lucas's love for literature also appealed to him.

The abstract formal perspective of bureaucracy/democracy, with which the Trotskyist tradition treats this crucial period in Comintern history, became separated from any content. Bordiga throughout his life called himself a Leninist and never polemicized against Lenin directly, but his totally different appreciation of the 1921 conjuncture, its consequences for the Comintern, and his opposition to Lenin and Trotsky on the united front issue illuminates a turning point that is generally obscured by the heirs of the Trotskyist wing of the international left opposition of the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Such incommensurability exists {{not just}} {{before and after}} a {{paradigm}} shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language {{that can be used}} to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: [...] "Though each may hope to convert the other to his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs." [...] Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up talking past one another.|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} {{consciousness of}} effective groups of researchers is characterised by shared understandings {{of their research}} object or territory. In the relatively new field of information technology research, rapid expansion and fragmentation of the territory has led to different perceptions about what constitutes information technology research. This project explores a facet of the collective consciousness of disparate groups of researchers and lays a foundation for constructing shared research objects. Making IT researchers’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> explicit may help us {{understand some of the}} complexities associated with inter and intra disciplinary collaboration amongst research groups, and the complexities associated with technology transfer to industry. This report analyses IT research, its objects and territories, as they are constituted by IT researchers associated with the sub-disciplines of information systems, computer science and information security. A phenomenographic approach is used to elicit data from a diverse range of IT researchers in semistructured interviews. This data is analysed to show (1) the variation in meaning associated with the idea of IT research and (2) the awareness structures through which participants experience variation in <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the object and territories of IT research. An Outcome Space represents the interrelation between different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> the territory. Eight <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeing</b> IT research, its objects and territories, were found: The Technology Conception, The Information Conception, The Information and Technology Conception, The Communication Conception, The Ubiquitous Conception, The Sanctioned Conception, The Dialectic Conception and The Constructed Conception. These are described in detail and illustrated with participants’ quotes. Finally, some recommendations for further research are made...|$|R
