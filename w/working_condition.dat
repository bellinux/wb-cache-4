5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to <b>working</b> <b>condition.</b> The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|E

It is a unique instrument for better understanding the quality of work and employment and the factors influencing it. Eurofound is committed to improving further {{the quality of the}} EWCS and strengthening its relevance for Eurofound’s tripartite stakeholders. Some of the most important sources of information {{for the development of the}} EWCS questionnaire are the national surveys on <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> This compilation is a follow-up of a study of <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> surveys commissioned by Eurofound in 2006 which covered both national and transnational <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> surveys (Eurofound, 2007). The main goals of this inventory are to: update the background information on existing national <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> surveys; create a source of basic information from national <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> surveys related to methodologies, quality control procedures, fieldwork and findings; provide a practical resource for researchers, policymakers, social partners and others with a professional interest in <b>working</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to analyse the wage {{differentials}} associated with non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> using objective and subjective data. In some situations a worker can be compensated for unsatisfactory <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> via a higher wage; conversely, {{in the presence of}} segmented labor markets, higher wages can be associated with favorable non-monetary <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> Moreover, a positive correlation between wages and satisfactory <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> exists when there is efficient union bargaining regarding both wages and <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the present study, we estimate a wage equation with variables that capture workers' subjective views regarding their current non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> allowing for unobserved individual heterogeneity. Our results reveal a positive wage differential associated with satisfactory non-pecuniary <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> This result supports the segmentation labor market hypothesis. The focus of the study is on Italian workers, but we compare the core results the those obtained for other Mediterranean countries. Copyright 2007 The Author.

The corresponding capability set includes all sets of alternatives <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> existing in the society for a given kind of job. Observing the existing capability set of <b>working</b> <b>conditions,</b> individuals formulate expectations about their own <b>working</b> <b>conditions.</b> These expectations might create biases in the realistic perceptions of job satisfaction. Our aim is to study the determinants of worker perceptions of quality of work in EU Countries. In particular, we shed light on the complex relationship that exists between job satisfaction, objective <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> and workers expectations. First, we determine which objective <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> impact on the level of job satisfaction. Second, we test the existence, and the signs, of biases in the realistic perception of job satisfaction due to the existence of expectations. Third, we test if expectations are affected by the <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> actually experienced in the job place. From a technically point of view, we estimate a two-tiered stochastic frontier model. We find that expectations biases exist. High expectations have stronger effects in reducing job satisfaction than low expectation in increasing job expectations.

Victim surveys from Sweden show that the proportion reporting exposure to work related violence has increased. On {{the basis of the}} Swedish Work Environment surveys 1991 – 2005 this article focuses on the following questions: What kind of situations and <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> are related to workplace violence? And, has the number of employees exposed to these <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> increased parallel to the rise of reported workplace violence? Logistic regression analysis shows that some situations and <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> are indeed related tothe risk of violence. To some extent exposure to these <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> co-varies with exposure to violence. This result is more prominent for women than for men. Further research is needed to understand how changes in <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> affect the risk of violence and the development thereof, not least from a gender perspective. Even so, changes in <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> can not alone explain the increase of reported workplace violence in Sweden during this period. It seems that the influence of changed <b>working</b> <b>conditions</b> offers an interesting complement to criminological theories of broadened definitions and decreasing tolerance against violence in problematizing how an increase in reported workplace violence should and could be understood.
