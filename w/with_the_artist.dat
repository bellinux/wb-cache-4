5|$|Acting on {{a report}} in January 2009, the city council {{recommended}} that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved {{the replacement of the}} steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{technologies}} {{have affected the}} recording, distribution, and varying profitability of the underground industry.

The recording, trading and sale of bootlegs continues to thrive, however, even as artists and record companies attempt to provide officially-released alternatives to satisfy the demand.|$|E

5|$|Southard {{frequently}} {{traveled from}} Boston to New York City {{to participate in}} Walter Arensberg's salons, bringing scholarship to discussions of contemporary social-science topics. Arensberg was also friends with artists such as Marcel Duchamp. Southard analyzed the dreams of Arensberg's guests, and discussed the meaning of Duchamp's work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist.</b> Perhaps influenced by Arensberg and his friends, Southard began to write experimental poetry. He {{was a member of}} the Wicht Club, a social and intellectual group of young Harvard academics.|$|E
5|$|The game {{design was}} {{influenced}} by board games and the video games Elite and Advance Wars.

5|$|Busch {{made contact}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> {{association}} Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers Münchener Bilderbogen (Picture Sheets from Munich) and Fliegende Blätter (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests {{that at this}} time he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income.|$|E
5|$|In late 1957, Cameron {{moved to}} San Francisco {{with her friends}} Norman Rose and David Metzer. There she mingled within the same bohemian social circles {{as many of the}} beat {{generation}} of artists and writers, and was a regular at avant-garde poetry readings. She began a relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Burt Shonberg, and with him moved into a ranch outside of Joshua Tree. Together they began exploring the subject of Ufology, and became friends with the ufologist George Van Tassel. After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century was a time of great hope for {{progressive}} reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, who gathered leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners, and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. After two complicated and heart-rending affairs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.|$|E

5|$|The first project {{proposed}} {{and worked on}} was a period film to be called Dora-Heita, but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to Dodesukaden, an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly (by Kurosawa's standards) in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> focusing {{on the creation of}} a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director's best work.|$|E
