2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E

60|$|There {{had been}} a crash in the street, {{and the sound of}} a horse plunging; <b>the</b> two men <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> débris of a hansom was lying in the road, with one wheel hopelessly smashed, a few yards off.

60|$|He handed his pen {{carelessly}} <b>to</b> Uncle Ben. <b>The</b> large {{hand that}} took it timidly not only trembled but grasped it with such fatal and hopeless unfamiliarity that the master was fain <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and observe <b>the</b> birds also.|$|R
