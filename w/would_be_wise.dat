25|$|Yes then {{signed a}} deal with Frontiers Records and began {{recording}} in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated {{from a pair of}} songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the Drama album. During the recording sessions, the band thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. Fly from Here peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the US.|$|E
25|$|Spencer's {{association}} with Social Darwinism might have its origin {{in a specific}} interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result {{in the death of}} a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.|$|E

25|$|The German {{architect}} and city engineer Conrad Schick, a Jerusalem resident, later published a similar booklet, {{where he also}} detailed his own proposal for a railway, which called for a line through Ramallah and Beit Horon. A route {{along the lines of}} Schick's plan was for a long time considered the most viable, and French engineers conducted an extensive survey to that end in 1874–75. The concept of a railway to Jerusalem was also thought of by the American writer James T. Barclay; he envisioned a line from el-Arish, Askalon or Gaza. Another proposal was made by the engineer Humann, who surveyed the area suggested in 1864 that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to create a railway to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Humayun {{decided it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to {{withdraw}} still further. He and his army rode out through {{and across the}} Thar Desert, when the Hindu ruler Rao Maldeo Rathore allied with Sher Shah Suri against the Mughal Empire. In many accounts Humayun mentions {{how he and his}} pregnant wife had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year. Their rations were low, and they had little to eat; even drinking water was a major problem in the desert. When Hamida Bano's horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount. Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life.|$|E

The {{question of how to}} use the now functional weapon on Japan became an issue for the scientists. [...] While Oppenheimer favored no demonstration {{of the power of the}} new weapon to Japanese leaders, Lawrence felt strongly that a demonstration <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise.</b> When a uranium bomb was used without warning in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Lawrence felt great pride in his accomplishment.|$|E

Author Mark Hertsgaard {{describes}} {{the film as}} [...] "a slapdash affair featuring the hula dancers that was salvaged only by some ludicrously spastic dancing by Lennon". Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed; speculating in the May 1968 issue of Esquire {{on the content of}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, which had yet to air in America, Christgau wrote: [...] "But if Paul McCartney's work on the film clip of 'Hello Goodbye' is any indication, we <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> not to hope for too much." ...|$|E

500|$|The other {{branch of}} reactor {{development}} at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the one closer to Zinn's heart, was the fast breeder reactor. At {{the time it was}} believed that uranium was a scarce resource, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to make the best use of it. The breeders were designed to create more fissile material than they consumed. By 1948, he had become convinced that it would be unwise to build large experimental reactors near Chicago, and the AEC acquired land around Arco, Idaho, which became an outpost of Argonne. The Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I, but known at Argonne as [...] "ZIP" [...] — Zinn's Infernal Pile) was the first reactor to be cooled by liquid metal, and the first to produce electricity. It proved the breeder concept. AEC Chairman Gordon Dean described it as a major milestone in nuclear history.|$|E

500|$|Mohamed Heikal, a {{chronicler of}} Egyptian {{national}} policy {{decision making and}} confidant of Nasser, wrote in For Egypt Not For Nasser, that he had engaged Nasser {{on the subject of}} supporting the coup in Yemen. Heikal argued that Sallal's revolution could not absorb the massive number of Egyptian personnel who would arrive in Yemen to prop up his regime, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to consider sending Arab nationalist volunteers from throughout the Middle East to fight alongside the republican Yemeni forces, suggesting the Spanish Civil War as a template from which to conduct events in Yemen. Nasser refused Heikal's ideas, insisting on the need to protect the Arab nationalist movement. [...] Nasser was convinced that a regiment of Egyptian Special Forces and a wing of fighter-bombers would be able to secure the Yemeni republican coup d'état.|$|E
500|$|The {{place of}} Cyrene within the poem has {{implications}} beyond {{the level of}} content, for if her narrative is {{to be connected to}} the city of Cyrene in Libya, the terminus post quem for the composition of the Catalogue would be 631 BC, the approximate year of that city's foundation. Pindar, Pythian 9 tells how Apollo saw Cyrene hunting in her native Thessaly and was immediately enamoured of the tomboy. The god goes to the cave of the wise centaur Chiron and asks who she is and whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to consort with her. Chiron then prophesies that it is fated for Cyrene and Apollo to mate, and that he will bring her across the sea to Libya, where she will be queen of a portion of the land and bear to him a son, Aristaeus. A scholium on the ode states that [...] "Pindar took the story from an Ehoie of Hesiod's" [...] (...) and relates the opening lines of the section (Cat. fr. 215): ...|$|E
500|$|Even at {{this stage}} the true purpose of the site was unclear. Claims {{that it had been}} {{intended}} to be used for [...] "electro-magnetic projectors" [...] (railguns), firing huge shells at London, [...] were debunked by Lord Cherwell, Winston Churchill's scientific adviser, who calculated that it would take sixty times the output of Battersea Power Station to fire a one-ton shell. Sanders' investigation brought to light the V-3 project for the first time, to the alarm of the British government. He concluded that although the site had been damaged it [...] "could be completed or adapted for offensive action against this country at some future date, and [...] destruction is a matter of importance." [...] Sandys brought the matter to the attention of Churchill and advised: [...] "Since this installation constitutes a potential threat to London, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to ensure that it is demolished whilst our forces are still in France." [...] Churchill later commented that the V-3 installation at Mimoyecques [...] "might well have launched the most devastating attack of all on London." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1975, the Bruins and Eagleson {{had reached}} a deal that would pay Orr US$4 million (US$ in [...] dollars) for ten years. But when Orr's knee {{required}} surgery, the Bruins reduced its offer to US$295,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season and a payment of US$925,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) or 18.6% of the Bruins in June 1980. Eagleson turned down the offer and on June 7, 1976 {{was quoted in the}} Toronto Star as saying [...] "Boston offered a five-year deal at US$925,000 or 18.6 percent ownership of the club in 1980. I didn't think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> for him to be a player-owner." [...] On June 9, 1976, after Orr had signed with Chicago, Eagleson told the Toronto Globe and Mail that the Bruin offer was [...] "a five-year offer for US$295,000 a year. In addition, Orr was to receive US$925,000 in cash payable in June 1980. That was to be a cash payment or involve Orr's receiving 18.6 percent of the Bruins stock." [...] According to a famous 1990 story in the Toronto Star by Ellie Tesher, Orr stated that Eagleson never told him of the offer, during negotiations or after. While Eagleson had spoken publicly to reporters of the offer, he had not discussed it with Orr.|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E
500|$|Since 1864, when he {{received}} a single unsolicited vote at the Democratic National Convention, Hancock had been a perennial candidate. As military governor of Louisiana and Texas in 1867, Hancock had won {{the respect of the}} white conservative population by issuing his General Order Number 40, in which he stated that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials performed their duties, then [...] "the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion." [...] He had a larger following at the 1868 convention, finishing as high as second place in some rounds of balloting. In 1876, Hancock again drew a considerable following, but never finished higher than third place at that year's convention. In 1880, another Hancock boom began, this time centered mostly in the South. [...] In March of that year, the New Orleans Picayune ran an editorial that called for the general's nomination, partly for who he was—a war hero with conservative political principles—and partly for who he was not—a known partisan of either side of the monetary or tariff debates. As Tilden and Bayard rose and fell in the estimation of Democratic voters, Hancock's bid for nomination gathered steam. [...] Some were unsure whether, after eight years of Grant, himself a former general, the party <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to give the nomination to another [...] "man on horseback", but Hancock remained among the leading contenders as the convention began that June.|$|E
