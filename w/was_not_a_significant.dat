5|$|Body {{tissue samples}} from Eurasian sparrowhawks are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> or consistent decline in residues between 2000â€“2005.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{elected to}} conduct a front porch campaign, like McKinley in 1896. Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge spoke in the Northeast, {{later on in the}} South, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor in the election.|$|E
5|$|Quantum Break was {{developed}} by Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios. In 2010, the company released Alan Wake, another title published by Microsoft. The game received high critical praise but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> commercial success for either company. Remedy intended to develop a sequel to Alan Wake {{after the release of}} the first game, and hoped to include live action elements into the game. The concept was pitched to Microsoft, who showed no interest in publishing another Alan Wake game and wanted to diversify their games lineup.|$|E

5|$|The game <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{commercial}} success but received widespread critical praise {{and has since}} become a cult classic. It was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by video game journalists {{to be the best}} role-playing game of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release, with a source port version of Torment released on April 11, 2017 by Beamdog.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> concern.|$|E

25|$|Dancing the Dream was {{published}} by Doubleday on June 18, 1992, seven months {{after the release of}} Jackson's 1991 Dangerous album. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> commercial success.

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, the Church {{was not in}} a {{struggle}} for its existence during its first centuries, before its adoption by the Roman Empire as its national religion. Persecutions of Christians were sporadic and locally inspired, and almost never state-sanctioned. In the first two centuries Christianity was a relatively small sect which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> concern of the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|The bridge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{source of}} noise {{affecting}} East Palo Alto; however, it does cause significant traffic backups at rush hour and the city is also affected by noise from events at the nearby Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View.|$|R
25|$|Cleaning {{cat litter}} boxes is a {{potential}} route of infection; however, numerous studies have shown living in a household with <b>a</b> cat <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> risk factor for T. gondii infection, though living with several kittens has some significance.|$|R
50|$|Bacteria in Class A sludge {{products}} can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions. Pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge.

25|$|As rail {{was already}} the primary urban mode of {{passenger}} travel, from that perspective it was {{akin to a}} sunk cost; there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as Kakegawa {{that would otherwise be}} too distant from major cities.|$|E
25|$|Days of Heaven {{received}} positive reviews on {{its original}} theatrical release; its photography was widely praised, although {{a small number}} of critics considered only this aspect to be worthy of high praise. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> commercial success, but did win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography along with three nominations for the score, costume design and sound. Malick also won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the American XX Bomber Command {{launched}} Operation Matterhorn, {{an ambitious}} plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The Operating base {{was located in}} Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.|$|E
25|$|Crime in Tuvalu <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{social problem}} {{due to an}} {{effective}} criminal justice system, also due {{to the influence of}} the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders of each island) and the central role of religious institutions in the Tuvaluan community.|$|R
50|$|A Tensionless hitch is {{an anchor}} knot used for rappelling or rope rescue. Unlike most knots, the tensionless hitch retains a 100% {{efficiency}} rating, meaning {{the strength of}} the knot is equal to {{the strength of the}} rope; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> stress riser.|$|R
50|$|CASCs {{must ensure}} that costs {{associated}} with membership of the club <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> obstacle to membership or {{to the use of}} its facilities.

25|$|After {{his return}} to Berlin, Streich was without a post for seven months until Halder made him {{inspector}} of mobile troops for OKH. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> role and nor was his following appointment, commander of Recruiting Area Breslau, in June 1943. He received a promotion to generalleutnant in October 1943. He was able to avoid the encirclement of Breslau by the Soviet Army in February 1945 {{and made his way}} to Berlin where he was made commander of that city's Recruiting Area. He evaded the Soviet Army when they captured Berlin and was able to surrender to the Allies in the west. Held as a prisoner of war for three years, he later lived in Hamburg and died there on 20 August 1977.|$|E
25|$|At present, it {{is still}} {{believed}} that molecular oxygen <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{lithography}} {{is another}} method for forming ordered patterns {{that can be}} used to investigate the role that topography plays in promoting neuritogenesis. The mask parameters determine the pattern periodicity, but ridge width and depth are determined by the etching conditions. In a study, ridges were created with periods ranging from 400 through 4000nm, widths ranging from 70 through 1900nm, and a groove depth of 600nm; developing neurites demonstrated contact guidance with features as small as 70nm and greater than 90% of the neurites were within 10 degrees of parallel alignment with the ridges and grooves. There <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference in orientation with respect to the feature sizes used. The number of neurites per cell was constrained by the ridges and grooves, producing bipolar rather than branching phenotypes.|$|E

500|$|There {{were more}} mundane {{reasons not to}} settle, as Gibraltar had many {{disadvantages}} that were to hinder later settlers. It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the [...] "shallow draft and dense mud of the shore" [...] as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor during the Classical period as {{the entrance to the}} Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.|$|E
