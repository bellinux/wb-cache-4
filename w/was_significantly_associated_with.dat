25|$|Dysmenorrhea is {{estimated}} to affect approximately 25% of women. Reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals {{in their late teens}} and 20s, with reports usually declining with age. The prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 67.2% by one study and 90% by another. It has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races. Yet, a study of Hispanic adolescent females indicated a high prevalence and impact in this group. Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40. A questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems, including dysmenorrhea, were more common in females who had been sexually abused.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to peer pressure, and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to smoke cigarettes played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to smoke cigarettes. Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that social processes other than peer pressure also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated that peer pressure <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one peer pressure variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether peer pressure or self-selection is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} whether self-criticism and depressive symptoms mediate {{the relationship between}} recollections of parental rejection and suicidality. A community sample of 200 Portuguese adults completed, in counterbalanced order, a socio-demographic questionnaire, the short form of the Inventory for Assessing Memories of Parental Rearing Behaviour (EMBU), the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and reports of any suicide intention and=or ideation and suicide attempts. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that recollections of parental rejection <b>are</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> depressive symptoms and suicidality. Recollections of parental rejection are indirectly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> depressive symptoms and suicidality through self-criticism. The association between self-criticism and suicidality is mediated by depressive symptoms. In addition to a significant direct association between recollections of parental rejection and suicidality, the final model indicated that recollections of parental rejection <b>are</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> self-criticism. That same self-criticism <b>is</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> depressive symptoms which, in turn, <b>are</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> suicidality. Individuals with recollections of parental rejection {{are at greater risk}} for suicide ideation and behavior, possibly because such experiences predispose them to intense self-criticism which is a risk factor for depression <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> suicidal ideation and behavior...|$|R
