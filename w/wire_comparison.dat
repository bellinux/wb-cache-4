40|$|Abstract The {{design of}} welded {{aluminium}} structures subjected to fatigue loading is usually {{carried out on}} the basis of reference fatigue curves published in design codes. The reference curves are usually relevant to dynamic loading in ambient air and make provision for the presence of a corrosive environment by downgrading the detail category for a particular joint type. This investigation studied the corrosion-fatigue behaviour of Al 5083 -H 111 welded using ER 5356 <b>wire.</b> <b>Comparison</b> between experimentally determined fatigue curves and reference fatigue design curves published in Eurocode 9 confirms that 5083 -H 111 welds display significantly lower reference fatigue strengths than unwelded base material.

The two LEHV techniques presented are: 1. Fast Pulse Technique 1, which initiates a high voltage, narrow width pulse down a <b>wire.</b> <b>Comparison</b> of the return signature with and without an arc over occurring allows determination of the distance to defect. 2. Slow Charge Breakdown Technique 2, which slowly charges the distributed EWIS parasitic capacitance to a fixed voltage. If an arc over occurs, this distributed capacitance discharges, {{and analysis of the}} return signature allows determination of the distance to defect. I. Background Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems Inc. 3 has core business focus in advanced power control and electrical distribution in aircraft systems. The company has a long history in developing and manufacturing specialized test equipment for aircraft.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work an experimental-numerical {{approach}} {{is used to}} study the thermo-mechanical behaviour of NiTi wire for defining what parameters {{are the most important}} in actuator designing. Tests were carried out heating, by an electrical current, a wire having a diameter of 150 Pm, under constant stresses of 200 MPa. Data concerning strain, applied current and voltage are acquired during the tests by PC while wire temperature is recorded by thermographic system. The numerical code integrates the ordinary differential equation describing the volumetric wire heating and cooling transients assuming that the electrical power is the only external heating source. Temperature distribution in the wire is considered uniform and its change in time depends on wire specific heat, latent heat of the Martensitic-Austenitic transformation, free convection heat exchange coefficient and total emissivity of the surface <b>wire.</b> <b>Comparisons</b> between experimental and numerical results, obtained under different operating conditions, indicate that the wire heating rate mainly depends on the applied electrical power, latent heat of the Martensitic-Austenitic transformation, free convection heat exchange coefficient. In the case of the cooling transient, the capability to decrease the wire temperature to reach the ambient value is strongly effected, once the free convection heat exchange coefficient is defined, by the shape of the curve representing the Austenitic-Martensitic transformation. Simulations of the wire behaviour point out that the time necessary to obtain the maximum strain can be reduce to few ms if current of 10 A is used. Moreover, the strain dependence on time can be tailored by choosing the suitable heating transient...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to understand the}} fundamental physics of extremely high frequency RF effects on electronics. To accomplish this objective, we produced models, conducted simulations, and performed measurements to identify the mechanisms of effects as frequency increases into the millimeter-wave regime. Our purpose was to answer the questions, 'What are the tradeoffs between coupling, transmission losses, and device responses as frequency increases?', and, 'How high in frequency do effects on electronic systems continue to occur?' Using full wave electromagnetics codes and a transmission-line/circuit code, we investigated how extremely high-frequency RF propagates on wires and printed circuit board traces. We investigated both field-to-wire coupling and direct illumination of printed circuit boards to determine the significant mechanisms for inducing currents at device terminals.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is recognised as an established pathogen in such infections. Combination therapy using linezolid and bacteriophage impregnated in biopolymer was investigated {{in the present study}} as an alternative strategy to prevent MRSA colonisation on the orthopaedic implant surface. Methodology: Coating of stainless steel orthopaedic grade K-wires was achieved using hydroxypropylmethlycellulose (HPMC) mixed with phage alone, linezolid alone and phage and linezolid together. The potential of these agents to inhibit adhesion of S. aureus (MRSA) 43300 on K-wires was assessed.

Fully consistent {{methods of analysis}} are developed from earlier work involving minimum energy search techniques. The descent direction in the iterative process {{is determined by the}} method of conjugate gradients. The algorithm is suitable for both cable trusses and cable net structures and can include the effect of fully flexible boundaries. Convergence is obtained for all of the structural forms investigated for loadings up to the point where significant instability in the structure caused by member slackening occurs.
