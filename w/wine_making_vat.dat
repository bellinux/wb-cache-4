From these antiquities Wheeler concluded that the site was related to a period of trading with Rome, {{and that it was}} first established by emperor Augustus. He also noted that this Indo-Roman trade lasted for a period of about 200 years, till 200 CE. Wheeler also found the Chinese celadon, identified to belong to the Song-Yuan dynasty, and Chola coins from about the eleventh century, but these were rejected as despoiling items or remnants left by brick-robbers. Items Chinese blue-and-white ware were also recovered from the site.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} cooperation {{and the establishment of}} formal <b>wine</b> <b>making</b> cooperatives amongst <b>wine</b> producers in three countries - Italy, France and Spain. High monitoring costs associated with wage labour, and increasing economies of scale in <b>wine</b> <b>making</b> encouraged large and small growers to cooperate in a large number of areas. The collapse in wine prices {{in the early twentieth century}} stimulated widespread interest in <b>wine</b> <b>making</b> cooperatives. Yet despite the apparent economic advantages of membership for smaller producers, the diffusion of cooperatives varied significantly between, and within, these countries. Access to long term capital, the role of church and political parties in encouraging producer cooperatives, the availability of alternative <b>wine</b> <b>making</b> facilities, and the degree of mobility of small growers, are all shown to be important.

LIKEWISE, THE FORMATION OF VOLATILE BYPRODUCTS IN WINES PREPARED BY CONTINUOUS <b>WINE</b> <b>MAKING</b> AND THEINFLUENCE OF LOW TEMPERATURE WERE ALSO EXAMINED. TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS OF CONTINUOUS <b>WINE</b> <b>MAKING</b> WITH IMMOBILIZED CELLS, BATCH FERMENTATIONS WERE PERFORMED USING IMMOBILIZED AND FREE CELLS, SEPARATELY, IN THE SAME RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. IN THE FRAME OF THESE EXPERIMENTSFOUR-FOLD HIGHER ETHANOL PRODUCTIVITIES AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND TEN-FOLD HIGHER AT LOW TEMPERATURES WERE OBTAINED BY CONTINUOUS <b>WINE</b> <b>MAKING,</b> IN COMPARISON TO BATCH FERMENTATIONS PERFORMED WITH FREE CELLS. THE VOLATILE BYPRODUCTS, METHANOL, ETHANAL, ETHYL-ACETATE, PROPANOL- 1,ISOBUTYL-ALCOHOL AND AMYL-ALCOHOLS WERE STUDIED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT WINES PREPARED AT LOW TEMPERATURES HAD BETTER AROMA. ALSO, CONTINUOUS <b>WINE</b> <b>MAKING</b> GAVE WINES WITH BETTER ORGANOLEPTIC CHARACTERISTICS THAN BATCH FERMENTATION. FINALLY, IN THIS DOCTORAL THESIS AN INDUSTRIAL-SCALE PILOT PLANT FOR MOLASSE FERMENTATION IN THE PRESENCE OF KISSIRIS WAS STUDIED.
