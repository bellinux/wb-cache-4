5|$|The Goon Show {{finished}} its ten-series run on 28 January 1960. In 1961, {{with his}} six-year relationship <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> at an end, Geldray {{worked as an}} entertainer on four trips on the RMS Queen Elizabeth. On visiting Los Angeles he {{was impressed by the}} city and decided to emigrate to the US.|$|E
5|$|He co-authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the {{aftermath}} of Enron, he co-sponsored (<b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan {{to minimize the risk}} of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to a Bad Man for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} off-screen by singing and dancing.|$|E

5|$|Officially, {{the only}} {{acceptable}} religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's {{position in the}} imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost Bürgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The Supremes' {{name change}} fueled already present {{rumors of a}} solo career for Ross {{and contributed to the}} {{professional}} and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> Randolph as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group the Andantes. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for the Spalding war memorial originated <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> McLaren (née Jekyll). Barbara was the widow of Francis McLaren—Spalding's Member of Parliament and a Royal Flying Corps officer, {{who was killed in}} a flying accident near RAF Montrose in 1917—and the niece of garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, with whom Lutyens had collaborated on multiple previous projects. Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in Busbridge in Surrey. He was later responsible for the war memorial in the same village.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} with szlachta had only gotten worse {{during the early}} years of the reign of Sigismund II Augustus and remained bad until 1562. Sigismund Augustus' secret marriage <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> Radziwiłł in 1547, before his accession to the throne, was strongly opposed by his mother Bona and by the magnates of the Crown. Sigismund, who took over the reign after his father's death in 1548, overcame the resistance and had Barbara crowned in 1550; a few months later the new queen died. Bona, estranged from her son returned to Italy in 1556, where she died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of several of Roger's friends, Barbara {{attempts}} to oversee his finances and takes {{him out of the}} still-chaotic city. At Tamworth, Roger gradually becomes worse and dies. Stricken and in mourning, Barbara holds a public memorial in London for her deceased husband, despite being warned that it would draw attention to his estate during the Parliamentary inquest into the financial crisis. To give her peace, the Duchess develops a scheme of spiriting her granddaughter out of the country by having her visit their plantation in Virginia. The novel ends <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> and several servants leaving on a ship intended for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in André de Toth's Civil War drama Springfield Rifle (1952)—a standard Warner Bros. film that was {{overshadowed by the}} success of its predecessor—Cooper made four films outside the United States. In Mark Robson's drama Return to Paradise (1953), Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor. Cooper endured spartan living conditions, long hours, and ill health during the three-month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa. Despite its beautiful cinematography, the film received poor reviews. Cooper's next three films were shot in Mexico. In Hugo Fregonese's action adventure film Blowing Wild (1953) <b>with</b> <b>Barbara</b> Stanwyck, he plays a wildcatter in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair. In 1954, Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway's Western drama Garden of Evil with Susan Hayward, about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman's husband. That same year, he appeared in Robert Aldrich's Western adventure Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster. In the film, Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor Maximilian I to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during the Mexican Rebellion of 1866. All of these films received poor reviews but did well at the box-office. For his work in Vera Cruz, Cooper earned $1.4 million in salary and percent of the gross.|$|E

50|$|Following Eugene O'Neill's {{death in}} 1953, public {{interest}} about him regenerated. Harper & Brothers Publications asked Brooks Atkinson, chief theater critic of The Times, {{to write a}} biography. Atkinson declined but suggested Arthur Gelb could write it, <b>with</b> <b>Barbara's</b> help. The book O'Neill, published in 1962 and detailing his boyhood and life as a seaman, became a best seller.|$|R
