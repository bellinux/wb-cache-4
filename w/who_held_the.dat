5|$|The {{championship}} {{was generally}} contested in professional wrestling matches, {{in which participants}} execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. There have been a total of 22 recognized champions {{who have had a}} combined 61 official reigns, with Ric Flair holding the most at seven (the actual total is eight, but WWE does not recognize the title being vacated after the 1994 Spring Stampede match, although WCW did recognize this). At 51, Flair was also the oldest champion when he won it in May 2000, while The Giant was the youngest when he won it in October 1995 at 23. The longest reigning champion was Hulk Hogan, <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> title for 469 days, which is the only reign to exceed one year (365 days).

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres in gold and a position within the Royal Household. Such rewards enabled Carrouge to begin further legal action, attempting to exert his earlier claim to Arnou-le-Faucon. However, this land which Carrouges so coveted remained beyond his reach. Count Pierre, <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E
5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{many in the}} LSO {{felt that}} Fleischmann was seeking to exert too much {{influence}} on {{the affairs of the}} orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, {{his body}} was {{transferred}} to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles there. His body survived the plundering of the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Constantine was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews Dalmatius (<b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> rank of Caesar) and Hannibalianus, presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, Constantina and Helena, wife of Emperor Julian.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> real power.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 14th century, a {{house by the}} name of Capell's Court stood on the site of Linton Park. It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell <b>who</b> <b>held</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} from the late 14th century to the mid-15th century. It was then sold to the Baysden family who held it until the late 16th century, when it was sold to Sir Anthony Mayney. Mayney's grandson sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis Wythen. Wythen's daughter, Catherine, inherited the estate and, following her second marriage to Brigadier-General Sir George Jocelyn, the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann.|$|E
