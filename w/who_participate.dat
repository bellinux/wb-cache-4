Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models <b>who</b> <b>participate,</b> that some thought it might.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women <b>who</b> <b>participate</b> in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{possible}} relationships between participation in extracurricular activities and student achievement, participation in extracurricular activities and attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities and behavior. The setting for this study was a high school in western Nebraska. Data for 275 of the school district 2 ̆ 7 s 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 high school graduates were obtained from the high school activities office and the school district 2 ̆ 7 s student management system. Ten research hypotheses were tested using appropriate statistical analyses. ^ Relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in extracurricular activities had higher grade point averages than students <b>who</b> did not <b>participate.</b> (2) Students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in extracurricular activities had a higher rate of school attendance than students <b>who</b> did not <b>participate.</b> (3) Students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only sport activities received more disciplinary referrals than students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (4) Students whose families have a higher level of socio-economic status were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities. (5) White students were more likely to participate in extracurricular activities than Hispanic and other racial ethnic backgrounds. ^ No relationships were found for five research hypotheses: (1) Between grade point averages of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only sports activities and grade point averages of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (2) Between attendance of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only sports activities and attendance of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities. (3) Between participation in extracurricular activities and disciplinary referrals. (4) Between grade point averages of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only sports activities, grade point averages of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities, and grade point averages of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in both sport and non-sport activities. Between attendance of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only sport activities, attendance of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in only non-sport activities, and attendance of students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> in both sport and non-sport activities. ...|$|R

Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the focus of attention, the focal point during the ensemble during this mode.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans <b>who</b> <b>participate</b> in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout {{the population in the}} presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|FIU {{also holds}} many Golden Panther spirit events {{throughout}} the year. Some of these include, Panther Camp {{held in the}} Summer prior to the Fall term for incoming freshmen, where students spend a weekend in a retreat center learning all the traditional Golden Panther cheers, chants, traditions meeting other incoming students. Started in 2006, Panther Camp has grown quickly in popularity from only 25 participants in 2006 to over 120 participants in 2007. In 2008, Panther Camp expanded to two camps with a combined total of 240 freshman participants. Panther Camp {{is expected to grow}} in size for Summer 2010, as the waiting list has continued to double from year to year. Freshmen <b>who</b> <b>participate</b> are more likely to get involved in Student Life than other students.|$|E
5|$|Females <b>who</b> <b>participate</b> in extra-pair fertilizations may {{incorporate}} better {{genes in}} their offspring {{than they could}} get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, <b>who</b> <b>participate</b> in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E
