2500|$|In 1976, Rabbitt married Janine Girardi, who he {{described}} as [...] "a little thing about five feet tall, with long, black beautiful hair, and a real pretty face." [...] He had previously written the songs [...] "Pure Love" [...] and [...] "Sweet Janine" [...] for her. They had three children, Demelza, Timmy, and Tommy. Timmy was diagnosed with biliary atresia upon birth. The condition required a liver transplant for survival and he underwent one in 1985, but the attempt failed and he died. Rabbitt temporarily put his career on hiatus, stating that [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of the music business, but where I was more important." [...] Tommy was born in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 2010, Ochoa {{released}} a statement indicating her intent to retire from professional golf. [...] At a press conference held in Mexico City on 23 April 2010, Ochoa said her last tournament would be the 2010 Tres Marias Championship to be played from 29 April through 2 May. She said that her career plan had always been to play for [...] "around ten years" [...] and to be the number 1 ranked player in the world. She also said: [...] "I {{just want to be}} honest with all of you. I went to Asia, and after two or three days of being in Thailand, it was really easy to me – it was really clear to see that I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> there, you know. I just was thinking of other things. I wanted to get home. I wanted to start working on the foundation. I wanted to be here close to my family." ...|$|E

5000|$|Attendance climbed, mostly through word of mouth. In a 1950 {{article in}} The Saturday Evening Post, OSV was {{featured}} as [...] "The Town That <b>Wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Out</b> of Date".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{just enough}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of no use," [...] Mary answered. [...] "Carleton was rather decent, {{so far as}} {{that part of it}} was concerned, and insisted on paying him a fair price. The market value would have been much less; and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must. Besides, Jasper {{says that}} Conolly is coming this evening {{to pack up}} his traps and go; and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of the way when he is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "we shall <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> at that time. We {{will take}} {{something}} now {{as soon as}} we can have it. Can you give us a beefsteak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm sure I'm {{always very}} fond of him--but then he's so queer; but, Father John, if I've {{offended}} Thady, I'll beg his pardon, for I'm sure I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> with him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even Marjorie Cottle {{eventually}} gave up competing. According to Koerner: For {{several years}} afterwards, however, she was {{employed by the}} BSA company {{as one of their}} motor cycle sales representatives although she seems <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> kept in the showrooms not where she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>out</b> on the road or riding in competition events. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wi' your honour's leave," [...] said Ratcliffe, [...] "if I kend sae weel how to wun out mysell, it's like I wad be a' {{the better}} {{a hand to}} keep other folk in. I think they wad ken their {{business}} weel that held me in when I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out,</b> or wan out when I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hand them in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I could!' said Phyllis, as if a {{new light}} had broken in upon her. 'But then I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of sight of pussy, for I could not think a bit, while the kitten was at play so prettily, and I kicked my heels to keep from hearing {{the voices in the}} garden, for it does make me so unhappy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the brandy}} strong," [...] muttered the priest thickly, as this third dose of raw spirit took effect upon him. [...] "Now {{get on with}} the business, for I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of this hole before the flood comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} I buy it or {{take it on}} lease. But it mustn't be in this county. I am too well known here, and should always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> when I ought to be looking after the stock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} for Maxon," [...] growled the creature. [...] "We have been penned up long enough. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> here. We {{have come to}} kill Maxon and you and all who have made us what we are." ...|$|E
60|$|Her wrath {{came from}} her feeling of guilt. Yes, Milt had been commonplace. Had she done this to him? Had she turned his cheerful ignorances into a careful stupor? And she felt stuffy and choking and overpacked with food. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> on the road, clear-headed, forcing her way through, an {{independent}} human being--with Milt not too far behind.|$|R
6000|$|As Mr. Wrenn {{returned}} to his desk he stopped at {{a window on the}} corridor and coveted the bright late afternoon. The cornices of lofty buildings glistened; the sunset shone fierily through the glass-inclosed layer-like upper floors. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> there in the streets with the shopping crowds. Old Goglefogle didn't consider him; why should he consider the firm? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{only makes}} it worse," [...] said Norman; [...] "I only {{feel as if}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of the way. My only {{comfortable}} time yesterday was on that bench in the cool quiet cloister. I don't think I could have got through without that, when they left me in peace, till Cheviot and Harry came to rout me up, and I knew it was all coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked over}} her {{shoulder}} toward the house. [...] "Not here! I've run away from a she-devil; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of sight. Further away, Mister--I don't know your name. Tell me your name; I won't trust you, unless you tell me your name!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to suggest that very thing," [...] {{retorted}} Hal. [...] "We'll make it the greatest Christmas this old Hollow ever saw. Now, let's turn in. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> for those rabbits right early. By the way, Alec, I hope there's some of that venison left for the big feast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O hush, Tom, I {{can never}} be a lady--and I can't stand dawdling here--nor you neither. 'Tisn't right to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of our station, though I do wish I lived in an old castle, where the maidens worked tapestry, and heard minstrels, never had no stairs to scour. Come, give me my mats, and thank you kindly!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Davalos {{struck out}} on her own at {{seventeen}} and headed to New York City. She supported herself by modeling for photographers like Peter Lindbergh. [...] "I had a mission," [...] she recalls. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> in the world, doing my own thing. Working in a theatre, I discovered that I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> act." [...] Her passion soon grew towards acting, and she attended the Off Broadway Flea Theater in New York.|$|R

6000|$|... 'No, no.' She {{could not}} say more. She was always ill at ease when he spoke {{of himself as a}} piece of human nature in that {{analytical}} way, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of his presence. The time of day, and the proximity of the house, afforded her a means of escape. 'I must be with Miss Aldclyffe now--will you excuse my hasty coming and going?' she said prettily. Before he had replied she had parted from him.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there are}} long {{corridors}} defended by gusts of hot air; {{down the middle}} swoops a pale little girl on parlour skates. “Get out of my way!” she shrieks as she passes; she has ribbons in her hair and frills on her dress; she makes the tour of the immense hotel. I think of Puck, who put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes, and wonder what {{he said as he}} flitted by. A black waiter marches past me bearing a tray that he thrusts into my spine as he goes. It’s laden with large white jugs; they tinkle as he moves, and I recognise the unconsoling fluid. We’re dying of iced water, of hot air, of flaring gas. I sit in my room thinking of these things—this room of mine which is a chamber of pain. The walls are white and bare, they shine in the rays of a horrible chandelier of imitation bronze which depends {{from the middle of the}} ceiling. It flings a patch of shadow on a small table covered with white marble, of which the genial surface supports at the present moment the sheet of paper I thus employ for you; and when I go to bed (I like to read in bed, Harvard) it becomes an object of mockery and torment. It dangles at inaccessible heights; it stares me in the face; it flings the light on the covers of my book but not upon the page—the little French Elzevir I love so well. I rise and put out the gas—when my room becomes even lighter than before. Then a crude illumination from the hall, from the neighbouring room, pours through the glass openings that surmount the two doors of my apartment. It covers my bed, where I toss and groan; it beats in through my closed lids; it’s accompanied by the most vulgar, though the most human, sounds. I spring up to call for some help, some remedy; but there’s no bell and I feel desolate and weak. There’s only a strange orifice in the wall, through which the traveller in distress may transmit his appeal. I fill it with incoherent sounds, and sounds more incoherent yet come back to me. I gather at last their meaning; they appear to constitute an awful inquiry. A hollow impersonal voice wishes to know what I want, and the very question paralyses me. I want everything—yet I want nothing, nothing this hard impersonality can give! I want my little corner of Paris; I want the rich, the deep, the dark Old World; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of this horrible place. Yet I can’t confide all this to that mechanical tube; it would be of no use; a barbarous laugh would come up from the office. Fancy appealing in these sacred, these intimate moments to an “office”; fancy calling out into indifferent space for a candle, for a curtain! I pay incalculable sums in this dreadful house, and yet haven’t a creature to assist me. I fling myself back on my couch and for a long time afterwards the orifice in the wall emits strange murmurs and rumblings. It seems unsatisfied and indignant and is evidently scolding me for my vagueness. My vagueness indeed, dear Harvard! I loathe their horrible arrangements—isn’t that definite enough? ...|$|E
6000|$|The scales have turned, my {{sympathetic}} Harvard, and {{the beam}} that has lifted you up has dropped me again on this terribly hard spot. I am extremely {{sorry to have}} missed you in London, but I received your little note, and took due heed of your injunction {{to let you know}} how I got on. I don't get on at all, my dear Harvard--I am consumed with the love of the farther shore. I have been so long away that I have dropped out of my place in this little Boston world, and the shallow tides of New England life have closed over it. I am a stranger here, and I {{find it hard to believe}} that I ever was a native. It is very hard, very cold, very vacant. I think of your warm, rich Paris; I think of the Boulevard St. Michel on the mild spring evenings. I see the little corner by the window (of the Cafe de la Jeunesse)--where I used to sit; the doors are open, the soft deep breath of the great city comes in. It is brilliant, yet there is a kind of tone, of body, in the brightness; the mighty murmur of the ripest civilisation in the world comes in; the dear old peuple de Paris, the most interesting people in the world, pass by. I have a little book in my pocket; it is exquisitely printed, a modern Elzevir. It is a lyric cry from the heart of young France, and is full of the sentiment of form. There is no form here, dear Harvard; I had no idea how little form there was. I don't know what I shall do; I feel so undraped, so uncurtained, so uncushioned; I feel as if I were sitting in the centre of a mighty [...] "reflector." [...] A terrible crude glare is over everything; the earth looks peeled and excoriated; the raw heavens seem to bleed with the quick hard light. I have not got back my rooms in West Cedar Street; they are occupied by a mesmeric healer. I am staying at an hotel, and it is very dreadful. Nothing for one's self; nothing for one's preferences and habits. No one to receive you when you arrive; you push in through a crowd, you edge up to a counter; you write your name in a horrible book, where every one may come and stare at it and finger it. A man behind the counter stares at you in silence; his stare seems to say to you, [...] "What the devil do YOU want?" [...] But after this stare he never looks at you again. He tosses down a key at you; he presses a bell; a savage Irishman arrives. [...] "Take him away," [...] he seems to say to the Irishman; but it is all done in silence; there is no answer to your own speech,--"What is to be done with me, please?" [...] "Wait and you will see," [...] the awful silence seems to say. There is a great crowd around you, but there is also a great stillness; every now and then you hear some one expectorate. There are a thousand people in this huge and hideous structure; they feed together in a big white-walled room. It is lighted by a thousand gas-jets, and heated by cast-iron screens, which vomit forth torrents of scorching air. The temperature is terrible; the atmosphere is more so; the furious light and heat seem to intensify the dreadful definiteness. When things are so ugly, they should not be so definite; and they are terribly ugly here. There is no mystery in the corners; there is no light and shade in the types. The people are haggard and joyless; they look as if they had no passions, no tastes, no senses. They sit feeding in silence, in the dry hard light; occasionally I hear the high firm note of a child. The servants are black and familiar; their faces shine as they shuffle about; there are blue tones in their dark masks. They have no manners; they address you, but they don't answer you; they plant themselves at your elbow (it rubs their clothes as you eat), and watch you as if your proceedings were strange. They deluge you with iced water; it's the only thing they will bring you; if you look round to summon them, they have gone for more. If you read the newspaper--which I don't, gracious Heaven! I can't--they hang over your shoulder and peruse it also. I always fold it up and present it to them; the newspapers here are indeed for an African taste. There are long corridors defended by gusts of hot air; down the middle swoops a pale little girl on parlour skates. [...] "Get out of my way!" [...] she shrieks as she passes; she has ribbons in her hair and frills on her dress; she makes the tour of the immense hotel.

It seems unsatisfied, indignant; it is evidently scolding me for my vagueness. My vagueness, indeed, dear Harvard! I loathe their horrible arrangements; isn't that definite enough? You asked me to tell you whom I see, and what I think of my friends. I haven't very many; I don't feel at all en rapport. The people are very good, very serious, very devoted to their work; but there is a terrible absence of variety of type. Every one is Mr. Jones, Mr. Brown; and every one looks like Mr. Jones and Mr. Brown. They are thin; they are diluted in the great tepid bath of Democracy! They lack completeness of identity; they are quite without modelling. No, they are not beautiful, my poor Harvard; it must be whispered that they are not beautiful. You may say that they are as beautiful as the French, as the Germans; but I can't agree with you there. The French, the Germans, have the greatest beauty of all--the beauty of their ugliness--the beauty of the strange, the grotesque. These people are not even ugly; they are only plain. Many of the girls are pretty; but to be only pretty is (to my sense) to be plain. Yet I have had some talk. I have seen a woman. She was on the steamer, and I afterward saw her in New York--a peculiar type, a real personality; a great deal of modelling, a great deal of colour, and yet a great deal of mystery. She was not, however, of this country; she was a compound of far-off things. But she was looking for something here--like me. We found each other, and for a moment that was enough. I have lost her now; I am sorry, because she liked to listen to me. She has passed away; I shall not see her again. She liked to listen to me; she almost understood! ...|$|E

"If {{you think}} this war against {{our way of life}} is over because some of the self-appointed opinion-makers and {{chattering}} class grow ‘war weary,’ because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> of Iraq or Afghanistan, you are mistaken.

5000|$|After retiring, Barber {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to retire to Coughlin's unrelenting style in practice. [...] "(Coughlin) pushed me in the direction (of television)," [...] said Barber.

5000|$|It's the {{beginning}} of something, it's the loneliness that I felt when I was making this album, {{because a lot of}} the writing of it was done late at night when everyone else <b>was</b> <b>out</b> doing their own thing. I wouldn't have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out,</b> but it <b>was</b> a feeling of everybody being someone else, and you're lonely. And also it's the unity that we all have from basic human emotions and we all came from somewhere, so we're all connected. And that's how I tied everything together.|$|R
