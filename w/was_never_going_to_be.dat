5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E

25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla.

25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less {{than they would have}} wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|England's first {{match against}} the unified Germany since 1938 was a {{friendly}} in 1991 at Wembley, which the Germans won 1–0. Five years later, at the 1996 European Championships, England played a unified German {{team for the}} first time in a competitive fixture, when they met in the semi-finals. Like the 1966 World Cup, the tournament was being held in England, and the semi-final was played at Wembley Stadium. England's fans and team were confident, particularly after wins in the group stage over Scotland (2–0) and the Netherlands (4–1) and their first ever penalty shoot-out victory, over Spain, in the quarter-finals. So vivid were the memories of 1966 for England fans that a media clamour ensued for England to wear red jerseys, instead of the unfamiliar-looking grey away kit that had been launched earlier that year (as England had not submitted details of any red kit to UEFA before the tournament, this <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> permitted, and England did wear grey).|$|E

500|$|Independence for East Timor, or even limited {{regional}} autonomy, <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed under Suharto's New Order. Notwithstanding Indonesian {{public opinion}} in the 1990s occasionally showing begrudging appreciation of the Timorese position, it was widely feared that an independent East Timor would destabilise Indonesian unity. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, however, caused tremendous upheaval in Indonesia and led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998, ending his thirty-year presidency. Prabowo, by then {{in command of the}} powerful Indonesian Strategic Reserve, went into exile in Jordan and military operations in East Timor were costing the bankrupt Indonesian government a million dollars a day. The subsequent [...] "reformasi" [...] period of relative political openness and transition, included unprecedented debate about Indonesia's relationship with East Timor.|$|E
500|$|In January 1900, Southern Cross returned, {{picked up}} the shore party and, {{following}} the route which Ross had taken 60years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some [...] south {{since the days of}} Ross. A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a Sami named Per Savio landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S. On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge might have been better received, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously".|$|E

[...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do exactly that; I'm a songwriter." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{geographical}} establishments in Britain {{and abroad}} {{were slow to}} give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States, but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised. Markham persisted in his attacks on Borchgrevink, describing him as cunning and unprincipled; Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice. Scott's biographer David Crane surmises that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his expedition would have been treated differently in Britain, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously". A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that [...] "justice had not been done {{at the time to}} the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition", and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated. After the expedition, Borchgrevink lived quietly, largely out of the public eye. He died in Oslo on 21 April 1934.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} script of {{the film}} included parts where the characters sang, {{but it did not}} make the final cut, and de Vries said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an opera, or even going to be a musical. It was very unlikely even to have any 'break into song' moments within it, but the fact that we designed it so that it could I think gives it that sort of strange, music-driven resonance." [...] References to both Roxy Music's [...] "Love is the Drug" [...] and Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit" [...] were seen in the original script, with the former being used in a musical sequence performed by actors Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac [...] "in the style of a Bob Fosse/Moulin Rouge kind of vibe", and the latter being picked by Snyder for his belief that it was [...] "perfect for our World War I [...] ". Bates considers Emilíana Torrini's cover of [...] "White Rabbit" [...] to be the soundtrack's standout. Nine songs are featured in the soundtrack, with Bates saying others were considered and discarded for among other reasons, veto from the original artists and [...] "lyrics too on the nose".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1173 {{and early}} 1174 Geoffrey fought a {{military}} campaign in northern England {{in support of}} his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion, the King of Scots, at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, to pledge fealty to Henry II. During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray, a supporter of the Scottish king. It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey [...] "My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!" [...] After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at Tours, where he probably befriended Peter of Blois, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that Adam, Bishop of St Asaph, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions. Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
