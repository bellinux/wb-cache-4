5|$|WVU {{introduced}} new uniforms for the 2013 season. The helmets, jerseys, {{and pants}} each feature blue, gold, and white primary color sets, creating 27 different possible uniform combinations. The reintroduction {{of the gold}} and <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> to the uniform scheme {{marked the first time}} each have been used since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recruits}} to {{the force}} in 1873 were issued uniforms comprising scarlet Norfolk jackets – issued from the militia stores and chosen {{on the advice}} of Colonel Patrick Robertson Ross and Governor Alexander Morris – brown belts, <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> grey breeches and brown boots, with a round forage cap for their undress uniform. The grey trousers were soon replaced with blue ones, with a yellow stripe along the sides. These early uniforms were quite plain, and commissioned officers and their enlisted men wore essentially the same uniform.|$|E

25|$|BC Lions – Introduced a black {{alternate}} {{uniform in}} 2005 {{loosely based on}} the 1960s jersey, initially worn with <b>white</b> <b>helmets.</b> Switched to orange helmets with black uniform from 2006 to 2008, including the 2006 West final and 94th Grey Cup win. Worn with black retro helmets in 2009 and 2010 seasons. Retired the jerseys in 2011 wearing <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> in the final game at Empire Field. Introduced gunmetal uniforms, first worn on August 17, 2013, and worn twice during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, including an away game in Toronto on August 17, 2014. The Lions did not wear a third jersey in 2015 or 2016.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 {{team was}} the first to wear <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> since 1974. The <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> were similar in design to the ones worn during the Jim Carlen era from 1970–1974 {{featuring}} a one-inch scarlet stripe in the middle bordered by two half inch black stripes. The helmets used in 2010 feature a black face mask instead of scarlet and the current version of the Double T. The helmets were worn for away games against the New Mexico Lobos, Iowa State Cyclones, and Oklahoma Sooners. The 2013 team saw a great expansion of uniform combinations and designs coinciding with Kingsbury's creative control over the uniforms.|$|E

Minnesota wore white away jerseys with maroon with gold {{shoulder}} stripes, gold pants, and <b>white</b> <b>helmets.</b> The ceremonial pregame coin toss to determine first possession employed a souvenir gold dollar minted for Alaska's statehood in 1959.|$|E

25|$|When {{performing}} {{public order}} maintenance operations (e.g. demonstrations and riots), police personnel wear a helmet in situations with {{increased risk of}} violence. The helmets are white because that colour is easier to spot by cameras and police helicopters. The helmet is plain white for inspectors (rank equivalent to police officer/constable) who function as section members during public order operations. Chief-inspectors (who function as section chiefs) wear <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> with one blue stripe running from back to front. Commissioners and chief-commissioners (who function as platoon commanders or even squadron commanders and group commanders) have two blue stripes.|$|E
25|$|Hats can be styled after {{baseball}} caps, combination caps, or fur trim Yukon (similar to the Ushanka) hats for winter. Motorcycle {{units have}} <b>white</b> <b>helmets.</b> Black or reflective yellow gloves are also provided to officers with Traffic Services. Front line officers usually wear combination caps since {{that is the}} location of their badge. Prior to the 1990s, female officers wore bowler caps instead of combination caps. Auxiliary officers wear combination caps with a checkered red and black band. The Mounted Unit wear black Canadian military fur wedge cap {{during the winter months}} and Custodian helmet for ceremonial use.|$|E
25|$|For several decades, the Eagles' {{colors were}} kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954, the Eagles, {{along with the}} Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969, the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> with Kelly green wings {{exclusively}} before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.|$|E

500|$|The Patriots {{originally}} wore red jerseys {{with white}} block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> {{first with the}} hat logo over the player's number, then with the [...] "Pat Patriot" [...] logo starting in 1961. A blue stripe {{was added to the}} two red helmet stripes in 1964. The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973. In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys. The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.|$|E
500|$|A tension {{remained}} between uniforms {{which were}} perceived as smart, reflecting the force's military heritage, and practical uniforms which were suitable for the daily work of the police. The mounted police's <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> forage caps and tight tunics were impractical for work on the plains, {{and a set of}} clothes termed [...] "prairie dress" [...] instead evolved unofficially, becoming the dominant style of uniform in the force by 1900. Prairie dress typically included a buckskin jacket, oilskins for wet weather, and leather leggings, combined with a wide-brimmed felt hat: by late 1890s, the Stetson was the headgear of choice. A standardised form of prairie dress, called patrol dress, was formalised in time for the 1897 Jubilee celebrations, featuring a brown duck stable jacket. By the turn of the century, many police were wearing a combination of a red serge tunic, cut to resemble the prairie dress tunic, and the Stetson hat, a combination which later became famous.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{was described as}} a [...] "colourful spectacle" [...] due to the Army's [...] Western Command Band wearing scarlet jackets and <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> the Army Guard of Honour in jungle green clothing and the blue uniforms of the mounted escort. The order of the wheelpast was Singapore, India, New Zealand, Rhodesia, Wales, Northern Ireland, England and the host country Australia. Hugh Leslie, the Games Chairman, in his speech said [...] "This event, apart from helping the participants, is designed to prove to the public that the person who is badly handicapped is not a cripple. I hope that this horrible word will eventually be wiped out of use." [...] Senator Shane Paltridge, who was representing the Federal Government, said [...] "This is one fine example of leadership taken by this State in the work to lift the paraplegic from a life of resignation to one of self respect and purpose in the community." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, the helmet's {{background}} color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson distinguish them more readily from {{three of their}} division rivals at that time, the Baltimore Colts, the Miami Dolphins, and the New England Patriots, who all also wore <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> at that point. Ferguson said [...] "Everyone we played had <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson {{just wanted to get}} more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field." [...] (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the AFC South, and the New York Jets, who switched to green helmets after the 1977 season, have since switched back to <b>white</b> <b>helmets.)</b> ...|$|E

2500|$|Most noticeably, {{the team}} {{switched}} from <b>white</b> <b>helmets</b> with orange and blue stripes {{down the middle}} to dark blue helmets with a [...] "V" [...] over two crossed sabres on the sides. [...] The V-Sabre logo was designed by Coach Welsh's son Matt. The rest of the uniform changed from predominantly orange and white to predominantly blue and white.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the team}} was renamed the Titans, the club {{introduced}} a new logo: a circle with three stars, similar to that found on the flag of Tennessee, containing a large [...] "T" [...] with a trail of flames similar to a comet. The uniforms consist of <b>white</b> <b>helmets,</b> red trim, and either navy or white jerseys. White pants are normally worn with the navy jerseys, and navy pants are worn with the white jerseys.
