5|$|It is {{possible}} that a third daughter of Malcolm married Findláech mac Ruaidrí and that Mac Bethad <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> his grandson, but this rests on relatively weak evidence.|$|E
5|$|A. Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was {{the only}} 2006 Winter Olympics {{medalist}} to be stripped of their medal. She won a silver medal in the 15km race, but tested positive for carphedon and <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> stripped of her medal. Germany's Martina Glagow was given the silver medal and fellow Russian Albina Akhatova won the bronze.|$|E
5|$|At independence, the {{policies}} of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority. The first five years after independence saw rapid gains {{in areas such as}} immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate. Zimbabwe <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> considered internationally to have an achieved a good record of health development.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes {{that could not be}} denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> successfully integrated into the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} {{loyalty to}} Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence were {{an incentive to}} remain in good standing with Rome. Roman government <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> limited, but efficient in its use of the resources available to it.|$|E
5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium was a {{relatively}} insignificant battle. The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy, nor prevent it from advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E

5|$|During {{the ensuing}} {{assassination}} investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to Indianapolis, Indiana under the looming threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, and he <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> never questioned about {{his knowledge of}} the plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea. However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of Euboea. This part of the Persian fleet <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, an Indian {{family court}} in Mumbai {{ruled that a}} husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E

5|$|In {{a further}} royal charter of 28 April 1472, King James III ordered the {{demolition}} of houses built on or outside the King's Wall, which were hampering efforts to strengthen the defences. Edinburgh <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> {{one of only three}} Scottish towns to have medieval stone walls, the others being Stirling and Perth, though other towns had earth walls or palisades.|$|E
5|$|In the General {{election}} of July 1945 Driberg increased his majority at Maldon to 7,727. Before the election he {{had joined the}} Labour Party and had been welcomed by the local constituency party as their candidate. He <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> one of the 393 Labour MPs in the landslide election victory that replaced Churchill as prime minister with Clement Attlee.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Shepseskare continued {{the construction of the}} funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> hastily changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.|$|E
5|$|John Cage and Marcel Duchamp were {{significant}} influences on Ono's art. She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and met {{him through his}} student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research: She <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.|$|E
5|$|King Stefan the First-Crowned, who {{had become}} ill, took monastic vows and died in 1227. Radoslav, the eldest son, became king; he was crowned at Žiča by his uncle, Archbishop Sava. Radoslav's younger brothers, Vladislav and Uroš I, {{received}} appanages. Sava II (Predislav) was appointed Bishop of Hum shortly thereafter, later serving as Archbishop of Serbia from 1263 to 1270. The Church and state <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> controlled by the same family, and the ties between the two continued.|$|E

5|$|Macartney then toured England for the 1912 Triangular Test Tournament, {{which also}} {{included}} South Africa. He {{was not in}} the original touring party, but six senior players including Hill and vice-captain Warwick Armstrong and leading batsman Victor Trumper withdrew from the tour due to a dispute with the board. Macartney <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> given a late call-up.|$|E
5|$|Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{launched}} an appeal, and Thornton was rearrested. Thornton claimed {{the right to}} trial by battle, a medieval usage {{that had never been}} repealed by Parliament. Ashford argued that the evidence against Thornton was overwhelming, and that he <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> ineligible to wage battle.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{had always}} found it {{difficult}} to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots were prepared to accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E
