500|$|Developments {{continued}} {{during the}} following decades. Linde developed water-cooled torches that helped prevent overheating when <b>welding</b> <b>with</b> high currents. During the 1950s, as the process continued to gain popularity, some users turned to carbon dioxide {{as an alternative to}} the more expensive welding atmospheres consisting of argon and helium, but this proved unacceptable for welding aluminum and magnesium because it reduced weld quality, so it is rarely used with GTAW today. [...] The use of any shielding gas containing an oxygen compound, such as carbon dioxide, quickly contaminates the tungsten electrode, making it unsuitable for the TIG process.|$|E
500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a constant voltage power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually <b>welding</b> <b>with</b> hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled wire feed unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the wire feed rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant wire feed rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. [...] This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDissimilar joining of Ti 3 Al-based alloy to Ni-based {{superalloy}} {{has been}} carried out using gas tungsten arc (GTA) <b>welding</b> technology <b>with</b> Ti–Nb and Ti–Ni–Nb filler alloys. The joint <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> the Ti–Nb filler alloy contained much less interfacial brittle phases than the one using the Ti–Ni–Nb filler alloy. The average room-temperature tensile strength of the joint <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> Ti–Nb was 202 MPa and the strength value of the one <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> Ti–Ni–Nb was 128 MPa. For both fillers, the weak links of the dissimilar joints were the weld/In 718 interfaces. The presence of TiNi, TiNi 3 and Ni 3 Nb intermetallic compounds in the joint <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> Ti–Ni–Nb induced microcracks at the weld/In 718 interface and deteriorated the mechanical properties of the joint. And the adoption of the Ti–Nb filler alloy decreased the formation tendency of interfacial brittle phases to some extent and thus enhanced the tensile strength of the joint...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{oxidation}} {{enhances the}} absorption of laser energy significantly and has little influence on the mechanical properties of laser welds ABSTRACT. The joining of thin sheet steel generally involves conduction mode welding, in which {{the reflection of the}} laser beam by the sheet surface is high. The absorption of laser energy by the workpiece increases significantly during keyhole laser welding, in which a vapor-plasma-filled cavity is formed. The reflectivity of cold-rolled thin sheet steel was found to be in the range of 65 – 80 % in CO 2 laser welding. The reflectivity de-creased to about 30 % when the sheet surface was oxidized before laser weld-ing. In the laser <b>welds</b> <b>with</b> surface oxidation, the oxygen inclusions and porosity were not found, but the grain size was large. However, the tensile strength of all <b>welds</b> — <b>with</b> or without surface oxidation — was higher than the base metal. The toughness of the <b>welds</b> <b>with</b> surface oxidation degraded, be-cause of the small amount of oxygen con-tent, but it was still comparable to the toughness of the welds without surface oxidation. The oxygen content in the <b>welds</b> <b>with</b> surface oxidation was found to be slightly higher than in the welds without surface oxidation. The mechani-cal properties of the <b>welds</b> <b>with</b> surface oxidation were found to improve when steel powders consisting of manganese and silicon were used during welding...|$|R

40|$|Al 7075 {{is widely}} used in the {{automobile}} and aviation industry due to its light weight, strength, and good durability. Fusion welding such as metal inert gas (MIG) is commonly used in joining aluminium alloys. It was used because of its low cost and is generally used by welders. However, defects usually occurred using fusion welding because of improper welding parameters {{and the types of}} filler metal used. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of filler metal and welding parameters on the mechanical properties of welded Al 7075. The welding parameters used are current, voltage, welding speed, and argon (Ar) as shielding gas. Two different types of filler metal, namely, Electrode Rod (ER) 4043 and ER 5356 have been used. From microstructure analysis, the fusion zone (FZ) of a sample <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> ER 4043 has a smaller grain size than that of one <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> ER 5356. Both fillers produce equiaxed dendritic grain at FZ. Both samples <b>welded</b> <b>with</b> ER 4043 and ER 5356 have a lower hardness value than the heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM) due to the differences in their main elements where ER 4043 is Al-Si and ER 5356 is Al-Mg. The wel efficiency of a sample using ER 5356 was 61 % which was higher compared <b>with</b> a sample <b>welded</b> using ER 4943, which is 43 % and both samples were brittle fractured.

40|$|Welding is a {{key process}} for heavy steel {{structure}}s, {{but it is also}} a weak link of the structure since fatigue fractures in welds are a common cause for failures. This thesis proposes several changes in order to improve the fatigue properties in a cost effective way. The main idea is to adopt the weld demand and weld procedures to the purpose of the weld. This approach ensures that the main focus in the welding process is the critical characteristics of the welds fatigue life properties. The fatigue life critical properties are most often related to the local weld geometry like the radius at the weld toe or the gap penetration in the root. The thesis describes a holistic view of the subject and cover fatigue cracking, welding standards, “good workmanship” as well as the welding process. It becomes quite clear that the traditional way of working is not the best and that a change is recommended in order to enhance the fatigue life and reduce the welding cost. A key challenge is to connect the welding process, weld demands and fatigue life properties. This is necessary for an optimized welding process of heavy structures subjected to fatigue and to get a predictable fatigue life. <b>Welds</b> <b>with</b> optimised fatigue life properties can be hard to introduce since they deviate from the standard and will most often not be accepted. Different weld procedures are proposed for improving the fatigue life properties of the weld, which indicate an excessive potential for enhanced fatigue life of fillet welds. The idea is to replace the “standard” fillet <b>weld</b> <b>with</b> three different <b>weld</b> types: (i) <b>Welds</b> <b>with</b> deep penetration, (ii) <b>Welds</b> <b>with</b> large <b>weld</b> toe radius and (iii) <b>Welds</b> <b>with</b> a low cost.
