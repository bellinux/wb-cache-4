25|$|On flight day 16, {{the members}} of space shuttle Endeavours STS-134 crew {{continued}} preparations for the shuttle's landing on flight day 17. Commander Mark Kelly, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist and flight engineer Roberto Vittori performed a checkout of Endeavours Flight Control Systems (FCS). They began by starting Auxiliary Power Unit 1 (APU 1), so they could test the flight systems such as the ailerons and rudder. The APU was used to provide hydraulic pressure to power the flight control systems. The astronauts next moved on to {{a test of the}} Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. This test saw Kelly, Johnson and Vittori fire each jet once. Meanwhile, Drew Feustel, Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff stowed items on the mid-deck for their return to Earth.

500|$|Some critics reacted {{negatively}} to the episode. Scott Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune {{felt that the}} show has jumped the shark starting from this episode. He felt that the Kurt storyline had some major flaws, and that the messages being sent have been mixed. The episode garnered criticism {{from a number of}} conservatives, who found the depiction of homosexuality abrasive. In an interview <b>with</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News,</b> conservative media critic Dan Gainor felt that it was Ryan Murphy's [...] "latest depraved initiative to promote his gay agenda." [...] He added: [...] "This is clearly Ryan Murphy's vision of what growing up should be, not most of America's. It's a high school most parents would not want to send their kids to." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} <b>with</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News,</b> sociologist of the University of Alberta, Stephen A.

The Internet, however, has posed insurmountable problems regarding control and censorship and Wikipedia's action {{is just one of}} many disputes that have occurred when Internet users have pushed back. Scientology can't roll over and give up on this issue. It will continue to attempt to have its representation." [...] Evgeny Morozov of Foreign Policy wrote a blog post critical of the Arbitration decision, and stated, [...] "I am no fan of Scientology, but I think that banning them from Wikipedia is going to be counterproductive. Unfortunately, it presents the Wikipedia admins/editors as a non-neutral group that opposes a particular set of ideas." [...] In an August 2010 article in The Guardian, journalists Rachel Shabi and Jemima Kiss observed, [...] "Editors can remain anonymous when changing content, but conflicts are passed to Wikipedia's arbitration committee. Scientology was a regular source of conflict until the committee blocked editing by the movement." ...|$|E

[...] Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments, and asked Justin Bieber, her idol, to perform a duet with her. Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter [...] "sunday comes after saturday? weird." [...] Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts. Rolling Stone's Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, [...] "She is actually a pretty decent singer. [...] She is a total sweetheart. [...] Black comes off as a well-adjusted, happy and grateful kid." [...] He also pointed out Black's intention to donate part of the profits from the song to school arts programs and relief efforts in Japan following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
