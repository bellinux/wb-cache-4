25|$|When using a silyl chloride, {{no special}} {{precautions}} are usually required, {{except for the}} exclusion of large amounts of water. An excess of silyl chloride can be employed but is not necessary. If excess reagent is used, the product will require flash chromatography to remove excess silanol and siloxane. Silyl triflates are <b>water</b> <b>sensitive</b> and must be run under inert atmosphere conditions. Purification involves the addition of an aqueous acid such as saturated ammonium chloride solution. This quenches remaining silyl reagent and protonates amine bases, removing them from the reaction mixture. Following extraction, the product can be purified by flash chromatography.|$|E

30|$|Focusing on the {{regional}} ocean carbon cycle, models project some nearshore systems {{to be highly}} vulnerable to future pH decrease. In the California Current system, an eastern upwelling system, strong seasonal upwelling of carbon-rich waters (Feely et al. [2008]) makes surface <b>waters</b> <b>sensitive</b> to future ocean acidification, as in the Southern Ocean. In the northwestern European shelf seas, large spatiotemporal pH variability is enhanced by local effects from river input and organic matter degradation, exacerbating ocean acidification from anthropogenic CO 2 invasion (Artioli et al. [2012]). In the Gulf of Mexico and East China Sea, coastal eutrophication, another anthropogenic perturbation, {{has been shown to}} enhance subsurface acidification as additional respired carbon accumulates at depth (Cai et al.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of mild, chronic water stress and acute water stress on two <b>water</b> stress <b>sensitive</b> plants, Xanthium strumarium and Helianthus annuus. Using a combination of the leaf disc O 2 electrode to measure the light responses of photosynthesis and 77 K fluorescence to monitor damage to the primary photochemistry, we have found the following: (a) The CO 2 saturated rate of photosynthesis at high light is the most <b>water</b> stress <b>sensitive</b> parameter measured. (b) The apparent quantum yield (moles O 2 per mole photons) was slightly, if at all, affected by mild water stress (>− 1. 5 megapascals). (c) Severe water stress (<− 1. 5 megapascals) reduced the quantum yield of photosynthesis regardless of whether the stress was applied in sun or shade. The light independent reduction of quantum yield was not associated with a reduction in 77 K fluorescence (Fv/Fm) indicating that the quantum yield reduction was not the result of damage to primary photochemistry. (d) The diel fluctuation in 77 K fluorescence seen in sun-exposed control leaves was greatly exaggerated in water stressed leaves because of enhanced decline in 77 K fluorescence in the morning. The rate of recovery was similar in both control and water stressed leaves. Shaded leaves showed no change in 77 K fluorescence regardless of whether water stress was imposed or not. (e) The <b>water</b> stress <b>sensitive</b> plants used in these experiments did not recover from acute water stress severe enough to reduce the quantum yield or chronic water stress which lasted long enough that light dependent damage to primary photochemistry occurred...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry {{was used}} to study the relationships among drying rate, desiccation sensitivity, and the properties of water in homeohydrous (recalcitrant) seeds of Landolphia kirkii. Slow drying of intact seeds to axis moisture contents of approximately 0. 9 to 0. 7 gram/gram caused lethal damage, whereas very rapid (flash) drying of excised embryonic axes permitted removal of water to approximately 0. 3 gram/gram. The amount of nonfreezable water in embryonic axes (0. 28 gram H 2 O/gram dry mass) did not change with drying rate and {{was similar to that}} of desiccation-tolerant seeds. These results suggest that the amount of nonfreezable water per se is not an important factor in desiccation sensitivity. However, flash drying that removed all freezable water damaged embryonic axes. Differences between desiccation-sensitive and -tolerant seeds occur at two levels: (a) tolerant seeds naturally lose freezable <b>water,</b> and <b>sensitive</b> seeds can lose this water without obvious damage only if it is removed very rapidly; (b) tolerant seeds can withstand the loss of a substantial proportion of nonfreezable <b>water,</b> whereas <b>sensitive</b> seeds are damaged if nonfreezable water is removed...|$|R

40|$|Thymus {{is one of}} {{the best}} known genera within the Labiatae (Lamiaceae) family, with more than 200 species and many {{medicinal}} and culinary uses. The effects of prolonged drought on lipid profile were investigated in tolerant and sensitive thyme plants (Thymus serpyllum L. and Thymus vulgaris L., respectively). Non-targeted non-polar metabolite profiling was carried out using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry with one-month-old plants exposed to drought stress, and their morpho-physiological parameters were also evaluated. Tolerant and sensitive plants exhibited clearly different responses at a physiological level. In addition, different trends for a number of non-polar metabolites were observed when comparing stressed and control samples, for both sensitive and tolerant plants. Sensitive plants showed the highest decrease (55 %) in main lipid components such as galactolipids and phospholipids. In tolerant plants, the level of lipids involved in signaling increased, while intensities of those induced by stress (e. g., oxylipins) dramatically decreased (50 – 60 %), in particular with respect to metabolites with m/z values of 519. 3331, 521. 3488, and 581. 3709. Partial least square discriminant analysis separated all the samples into four groups: tolerant <b>watered,</b> tolerant stressed, <b>sensitive</b> <b>watered</b> and <b>sensitive</b> stressed.
