5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred.|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1968, {{his father}} John S. McCain Jr. was named {{commander}} of all U.S. {{forces in the}} Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release {{because they wanted to}} appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated preferentially. McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III: “I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”. To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. They no longer believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} Zidane and the Tantalus Theater Troupe {{attempting}} to kidnap Princess Garnet during her sixteenth birthday celebration {{in the city}} of Alexandria. Upon reaching her, they discover that Garnet, who is concerned about Queen Brahne's increasingly erratic behavior, had planned on escaping the city and is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kidnapped, especially as their employer, Regent Cid of Lindblum, is who she wanted to run to. During the escape from the city, the troupe is joined by Vivi, who is looking to explore, and Steiner, who decides to travel with Garnet for her protection rather than take her back against her will. After the group flees the city and its guards, their damaged airship crashes, and Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner travel on together. During their journey to Lindblum, Garnet takes the alias Dagger, and the group discovers a factory in the village of Dali that is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Jo arms {{herself with}} her knife and stalks Kator as he hunts swans {{on a nearby}} river. Her attempt to {{eliminate}} him is thwarted when he starts to drown, alerting Jessica with his screams. Jessica and Jo rescue Kator and take {{him back to the}} house. While the two women clean themselves up, Kator kills and consumes Wally. Jessica tells Jo that she is no longer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> controlled and is leaving with Anders. Outraged, Jo knocks Jessica unconscious and runs into the woods to dig a grave for her. On waking, Jessica seduces Kator. As they start to have sex, Kator's predatory instincts are stirred, causing him to revert to his natural form and tear open Jessica's throat, killing her. Having returned to the house, Jo attempts to flee but falls into the open grave and presumably meets a similarly violent end.|$|E
25|$|In April of that year, Ugolino again {{refused to}} make peace with Genoa, even though the enemy was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> content itself with {{financial}} reparations. Ugolino still feared the return of the captured Pisans, who saw Ugolino as the cause for their prolonged captivity and had sworn to get their revenge for this.|$|E
25|$|From August 1746, {{negotiations}} {{began in}} the city of Lisbon, in neutral Portugal, to try to arrange a peace settlement. The death of Philip V of Spain had brought his son Ferdinand VI to the throne, and he was more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conciliatory over the issues of trade. However, because of their commitments to their Austrian allies, the British were unable to agree to Spanish demands for territory in Italy and talks broke down.|$|E
25|$|Some {{conceive}} free <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the capacity}} <b>to</b> make choices {{in which the}} outcome has not been determined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived. This problem has been identified in ancient Greek philosophy, and remains {{a major focus of}} philosophical debate. This view that conceives free <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism, and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and hard determinism, the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also its negation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incompatible with free will, and thus free <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.|$|R

25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera.

25|$|Edwardian Britain {{had large}} numbers {{of male and female}} {{domestic}} servants, in both urban and rural areas. Men relied on working class women to run their homes smoothly, and employers often looked to these working class women for sexual partners. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion. The number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian period due to a declining number of young people <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> employed in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to leave or stay was personal. Reasons for leaving ranged from noble (to join the fight), to fearful. Reasons for staying included defiance (not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intimidated), age (too old to move), money (not wanting to abandon businesses or houses), caring (not wanting to abandon elderly parents or pets), duty (civil servants and other essential workers were asked not to leave). Some literally missed the boat. King George VI sent a message of hope to the Bailiffs of each Island, with the request it be read out to the people.|$|E

25|$|Leaving Scotland, John Paul {{commanded}} a London-registered vessel named Betsy, a West Indiaman mounting 22 guns, engaging in commercial speculation in Tobago for about 18 months. This {{came to an}} end, however, when John killed a mutineer crew member named Blackton with a sword {{in a dispute over}} wages. He claimed that it was in self-defense, years later in a letter to Benjamin Franklin describing this incident, but he was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tried in an Admiral's Court, where the family of his first victim had been influential. He felt compelled to flee to Fredericksburg, Province of Virginia, leaving his fortune behind.|$|E
25|$|However, the British were {{determined}} not to leave Talaat alone. The British had intelligence reports indicating that {{he had gone to}} Germany, and the British High Commissioner pressured Damad Ferit Pasha and the Sublime Porte to demand from Germany to return him to the Ottoman Empire. As a result of efforts pursued personally by (Sir) Andrew Ryan, a former Dragoman and now a member of the British intelligence service, Germany responded to the Ottoman Empire stating that it was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> helpful if official papers could be produced showing these persons had been found guilty, and added that the presence of these persons in Germany could not as yet be ascertained.|$|E
25|$|Shukla, whose {{ancestors}} were farmers, held a radical view against the British.

After passing high school, he indulged himself in quit India movement on gandhi's call for immediate independence with passive resistance and went to attend the mass meeting held at gowalia tank maidan in Bombay, where Do or Die was coined by gandhi.|$|E

His appearances on TV talk shows in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped to establish Spiritism Doctrine as one of the major philosophies professed in Brazil with more than 5 million followers. Xavier's popularity remained unchanged in Brazil throughout his life. Despite his health problems he kept working up to his death, on June 30, 2002 in Uberaba. In 2010, a movie biography entitled Chico Xavier was released in Brazil. Directed by Daniel Filho, the film dramatized Xavier's life.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{second choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was {{considered}} beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber {{and went back to}} his own room. He maintained that she was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Minnesota Vikings were unhappy with Metropolitan Stadium's {{relatively}} small capacity for football (just under 48,500). Before the AFL-NFL merger, the NFL had declared that stadiums with a capacity smaller than 50,000 were not adequate for their needs. The biggest stadium {{in the area}} was the University of Minnesota's Memorial Stadium, but the Vikings were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tenants in a college football stadium and demanded a new venue. Supporters of a dome also believed that the Minnesota Twins would benefit from a climate-controlled stadium to insulate the team from harsh Minnesota weather later in the season. The Met would have likely needed to be replaced in any event, as it was not well maintained. Broken railings and seats {{could be seen in}} the upper deck by the early 1970s, and by its final season they had become a distinct safety hazard.|$|E
