25|$|Hamilton {{was educated}} at Haileybury and The Queen's College, Oxford. He played cricket for Haileybury in 1876 and 1877, {{and made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Oxford University against Australia in May 1882. He played five further matches for the University side that year against the MCC (twice), the Gentlemen of England and Surrey, before gaining his blue in June against Cambridge. He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> in the match {{that at one point}} he started to run the wrong way when called for a run.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey won a Heath Harrison Exhibition {{award and}} a place at Brasenose College at Oxford University to study {{geography}} {{in the autumn of}} 1951. He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 {{at the start of the}} season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. He had yet to make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> he could barely watch.|$|E
500|$|According to {{animator}} Mark Kausler, Krantz <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> about showing {{too much}} nudity and sexual activities {{that he had}} several versions of some sequences animated, for instance, in the [...] "Maybellene" [...] animation sequence. Kausler says that a sequence was animated in which the viewer sees [...] "the {{key in the ignition}} metamorphose into a penis entering Maybelline's vagina." [...] This sequence was deleted from Heavy Traffic, but the same action appeared in the film Down and Dirty Duck. Kausler also states: ...|$|E

500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On {{the subject}} of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, [...] "My father wrote her a formal letter {{inviting}} her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ... I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous.</b> In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on." [...] In 1958, when Rice was sixteen, her father moved the family to north Texas, purchasing their first home in Richardson. Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E

500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{interest}} in music started at around {{ten years of}} age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: [...] "I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so {{madly in love with}} it, it's all I did". He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> he played {{with his back to the}} audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. [...] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. [...] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: [...] "I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s".|$|E
500|$|The Third Test was {{abandoned}} without a ball being bowled due to rain, and Hassett {{prepared for what}} would be the decisive Fourth Test by scoring 94 and 127 in consecutive matches against Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The match at Headingley in Leeds was Australia's only Test victory, which was enough to ensure a drawn series and the retention of The Ashes. In a low-scoring match in a batsman-friendly series, Australia, chasing a target of only 105 runs to win, had slumped to 3/50 when Hassett came to the crease as an approaching storm threatened to either end the game or make the pitch difficult to bat on. Hassett calmly hit 33 runs from 36 balls, to guide the tourists to a five-wicket victory, much to the relief of his captain Don Bradman, who <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> about the outcome that he could not watch the play. The innings earned Hassett a reputation of being calm under pressure, and Bradman later wrote that Hassett was a [...] "masterful player" [...] in a crisis.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
2500|$|In later interviews, Lennon {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} the Beatles' {{arrangement of the}} recording, complaining that inadequate time was taken to fully develop his initial idea for the song. He {{also said that he}} had not sung it very well. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> I couldn't sing," [...] he told journalist Ray Connolly, [...] "but I like the lyrics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do wish," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "that {{father would}} travel by himself!

6000|$|... "Only {{when he is}} {{not with}} me, or when people force me to. If he is in the room, I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> that I can hardly get through the easiest song. He never offers to {{accompany}} me now, and generally leaves the room when I am asked to sing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no! indeed {{you would}} not, {{after a little}} practice. I {{have never been in}} the least timid.

They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{had avoided}} taking on {{official}} posts which would take valuable time, turning down William Whewell's request that he become Secretary of the Geological Society with excuses including [...] "anything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards and brings {{on a bad}} palpitation of the heart", but in January 1838 he accepted the post. On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepción, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, {{to the delight of}} Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> at first, I somehow could see nothing all around me, & felt as if my body was gone, & only my head left".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous,</b> but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with New York Posts PopWrap, Welch revealed that {{in the weeks and}} months prior to her 12 September performance at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>nervous</b> she lost sleep and cried. In addition, she struggled during the pre-show rehearsal with a move that required her to stand up on a rotating platform. It was described as [...] "both ethereal and downright joyous". After the performance, Lungs rose to number two on the iTunes albums chart and [...] "Dog Days Are Over" [...] rose to number nine on the iTunes singles chart. In addition, Florence and the Machine became the number-one search on Google and received 1,700 tweets per minute on Twitter. Florence and the Machine performed [...] "Dog Days Are Over" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on 15 October 2010. On 20 November 2010, the band performed [...] "Dog Days Are Over" [...] and [...] "You've Got the Love" [...] on Saturday Night Live. They performed an online-only concert at New York City's Ed Sullivan Theater on 16 December 2010 as part of the Live on Letterman concert series. Welch and a number of other female singers opened the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011 with a tribute to an ailing Aretha Franklin. On 27 February 2011, Welch replaced pregnant Dido and sang her portion of Best Original Song nominee [...] "If I Rise" [...] (from 127 Hours) with A. R. Rahman at the 83rd Academy Awards. Two years of worldwide touring had been scheduled to promote Ceremonials.
