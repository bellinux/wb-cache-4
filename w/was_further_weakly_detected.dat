40|$|Background: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) play a {{critical}} role in the pathology of diabetic complications. The aim of this study is to examine the immunolocalization of advanced glycation end products (AGE) and receptor for AGE (RAGE) in human diabetic and non-diabetic donor eyes using immunohistochemistry. Materials and Methods: Eight globes were obtained from human postmortem donors: six diabetic donors and two non-diabetic. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with anti-AGE, and RAGE antibodies. Results: In eyes from diabetic donors, the blood vessels of the iris and choroid had relatively thickened walls. The ciliary body showed decreased capillaries with hyalinization in the stroma. Neovascularization or proliferative changes were not observed in the tissues. Immunoreactivity for AGE was highly detected in the stroma and blood vessels of the iris, ciliary body, choriocapillaris, choroidal large vessels, and central retinal artery/vein. Immunoreactivity was also detected in the retina, corneal endothelium, and lens. RAGE immunoreactivity was <b>weakly</b> <b>detected</b> in choroidal vessels and Bruch’s membrane. In eyes from non-diabetic donors, AGE was <b>weakly</b> <b>detected</b> in the iris, ciliary body stroma, and choriocapillaris, but RAGE was hardly detected. Conclusion: AGE is highly accumulated in vascularized intraocular tissues of diabetic eyes, suggesting that AGE accumulation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy. This study indicates that inhibition of AGE formation may be an important therapeutic strategy for suppressing the progression of diabetic ocular complications...|$|R

40|$|A {{decrease}} {{in the level of}} sound events can compensate for an increase in the level of other events, but noise metrics assume different tradeoffs. Noise metrics also differ in the penalty applied to noise in the evening and to noise in the night, and in the definition of these periods. These two aspects of noise metrics, i. e., the tradeoff and the penalty for the nighttime (23 - 7 h), are investigated. A general model of the relation between SELs of sound events (aircraft overflights) and noise annoyance is presented which allows {{for a wide range of}} tradeoffs and time-of-day penalties. The (tradeoff and time-of-day penalty) parameters of the model are fitted to the data from an aircraft noise study conducted around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is especially suited for investigating the tradeoff and time- of-day penalties. It was found that in this study the tradeoff between the levels of events in metrics based on L(Aeq) 's, such as L(Aeq) (24 h), DNL, and DENL, is approximately correct for the prediction of noise annoyance. Furthermore, it was found that the strongest correlation with annoyance is obtained with a nighttime penalty of circa 10 dB. No suitable data <b>were</b> available for <b>further</b> tests of the tradeoff.

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{approach}} for the measurement of gas adsorption in microporous solids using X-ray computed tomography (CT) that we refer to as digital adsorption. Similar to conventional macroscopic methods, the proposed protocol combines observations with an inert and an adsorbing gas to produce equilibrium isotherms {{in terms of the}} truly measurable quantity in an adsorption experiment, namely the surface excess. Most significantly, X-ray CT allows probing the adsorption process in three dimensions, so as to build spatially-resolved adsorption isotherms with a resolution of approximately 10 mm 3 within a fixed-bed column. Experiments have been carried out at 25 C and in the pressure range 1 - 30 bar using CO 2 on activated carbon, zeolite 13 X and glass beads (as control material), and results are validated against literature data. A scaling approach was applied to analyze the whole population of measured adsorption isotherms (~ 7600), leading to single universal adsorption isotherm curves that are descriptive of all voxels for a given adsorbate-adsorbent system. By analyzing the adsorption heterogeneity at multiple length scales (1 mm 3 to 1 cm 3), packing heterogeneity was identified as the main contributor for the larger spatial variability in the adsorbed amount observed for the activated carbon rods as compared to zeolite pellets. We also show that this technique is readily applicable to a large spectrum of commercial porous solids, and that it can <b>be</b> <b>further</b> extended to <b>weakly</b> adsorbing materials with appropriate protocols that reduce measurement uncertainties. As such, the obtained results prove the feasibility of digital adsorption and highlight substantial opportunities for its wider use in the field of adsorptive characterization of porous solids...|$|R

It is important to elucidate the intermolecular interaction between CH 4 and CO. Method. The MP 2 calculation are carried out for the geometry optimization and following frequency analysis of CH 4 complexes with CO. Single point energies were calculated at the CCSD(T) / 6 - 311 ++G(2 d, 2 p) and MP 2 /aug-cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, and Q) levels to evaluate the basis set and electron correlation effects. Results. Interaction energies were calculated {{as a function of the}} intermolecular distance between CH 4 and CO where the CO molecule approaches CH 4 in the face, edge, or vertex direction. The HF potentials are calculated to be repulsive while after including the electron correlation the potentials become bound indicative of the importance of the dispersion energy for the attraction. The largest interaction energy was predicted for the face direction with oxygen-end approach of the CO molecule.

40|$|We {{classify}} and characterize three dimensional $U(1) $ quantum spin liquids (deconfined $U(1) $ gauge theories) {{with global}} symmetries. These spin liquids have an emergent gapless photon and emergent electric/magnetic excitations (which we assume are gapped). We first discuss {{in great detail}} the case with time reversal and $SO(3) $ spin rotational symmetries. We find there are 15 distinct such quantum spin liquids based on the properties of bulk excitations. We show how to interpret them as gauged symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs). Some of these states possess fractional response to an external $SO(3) $ gauge field, due to which we dub them "fractional topological paramagnets". We identify 11 other anomalous states that can be grouped into 3 anomaly classes. The classification <b>is</b> <b>further</b> refined by <b>weakly</b> coupling these quantum spin liquids to bosonic Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phases with the same symmetry. This refinement does not modify the bulk excitation structure but modifies universal surface properties. Taking this refinement into account, we find there are 168 distinct such $U(1) $ quantum spin liquids. After this warm-up we provide a general framework to classify symmetry enriched $U(1) $ quantum spin liquids for a large class of symmetries. As a more complex example, we discuss $U(1) $ quantum spin liquids with time reversal and $Z_ 2 $ symmetries in detail.

This means that the secondary must actually be two close stars of similar spectral type, themselves orbiting the more massive primary. Two faint absorption lines were <b>weakly</b> <b>detected</b> in the Hα line, varying by about 80 km/s over a period of a few days; these are consistent with two M-dwarfs orbiting each other, confirming that the secondary is a close binary. The subsystem consists of two approximately equal-mass red dwarfs orbiting each other every ~3.7 days. Binaries with such close orbits typically maintain high levels of activity for their lifetimes due to their rotational periods being synchronised to their orbital period, so the components of the secondary are the source of the excess energy in the system.|$|R
