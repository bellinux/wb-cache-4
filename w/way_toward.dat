5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below.

No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become {{a desperate attempt to}} escape to the South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E

5|$|NY9L {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9 and NY32 in downtown Glens Falls. It heads north, intersecting with local roads as it exits {{the city and}} enters the town of Queensbury. At the city line, maintenance of the route shifts {{from the city of}} Glens Falls to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Just north of the city limits, NY9L intersects NY254. The route continues northward through Queensbury, passing Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport and running parallel to the Washington County line on its <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> and eventually across the Blue Line into Adirondack Park. NY9L intersects NY149, an east–west arterial connecting Interstate87 (I-87) to Vermont, just north of the park limits.|$|E

It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. The bill was a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, the bill was heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, the bill was eventually withdrawn.|$|E

Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{months after}} Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone {{and on the}} run from monsters in {{southern}} California without his memories. Under the initial guidance of Lupa, the wolf-goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes his <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigod's Camp Half-Blood. Upon arriving, he is again attacked by several Gorgons, (Stheno and Euryale) and successfully defends a disguised goddess Juno as well as the camp {{with the help of the}} guards on duty. Because he protected her during the attack, Juno announces his arrival with her approval, identifying that Percy is a son of Neptune. She further tells him privately that he can only regain his memory by learning to be a hero again and successfully survive the challenges he encounters at camp.|$|E

The Allied 45th and 3rdDivisions, as well as the 11thPanzer Division, were racing north to fulfill their objectives. In the meantime, the Germans tried to continue with the evacuation through Lyon. Behind their flight, the Germans destroyed bridges, hoping this would slow down the Allied advance. However, the 45thDivision was able to bypass the German forces, taking the town of Meximieux on 1September. This again posed a threat to the German evacuation. After some initial skirmishes, the 11thPanzer Division launched a heavy attack into the city, causing 215 American casualties and destroying a number of tanks and vehicles.|$|E

5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E
