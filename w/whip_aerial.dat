2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> further back on the rear fuselage.|$|E
50|$|A {{receiver}} for a {{navigation system}} of synchronised pulses transmitted from the UK - aircraft calculated their position {{from the time}} delay between pulses. The range of GEE was 3-400 mi (483-644 km). GEE used a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage ahead of the mid-upper turret.|$|E
50|$|Between 1958 and 1960 Alliance was {{extensively}} modernised {{by having}} the deck gun and external torpedo tubes removed, the hull streamlined and the fin replaced with a larger (26 feet 6 inch high), more streamlined one constructed of aluminium. The purpose of these modifications {{was to make the}} submarine quieter and faster underwater. Following the modifications the wireless transmitting aerial was supported on a frame behind the fin; but was later replaced with a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> on the starboard side of the fin which could be rotated hydraulically to a horizontal position.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, FFW {{configurations}} {{were produced}} for the Jeep, Austin Champ and Land Rover. In these smaller vehicles, {{it was necessary}} to construct racking to hold the sets and often to remove the rear seats. Owing to the small capacity of the Jeep and early Landrover charging systems, the 300W charging set was still required, although there was little space for it and was sometimes even mounted between the front seats. The Austin Champ. however, was built in a dedicated FFW version from 1954 and was provided with dedicated radio supply connections and a high-output generator for the role. Single-set installations were produced for the Jeep during World War II The introduction of the post-war and smaller C42 & C45 sets allowed a dual-set installation, even in these small 5cwt or ¼-ton vehicles. <b>Whip</b> <b>aerials</b> for the VHF set(s) were installed on the front wings of these vehicles, together with their base-mounted Aerial Tuning Units to obtain maximum separation from any HF antenna. This practice became a distinctive feature of British Army vehicles in later years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest of}} these World War II FFW {{vehicles}} were the 3-ton command vehicles on lorry chassis and the 6×6 AEC Armoured Command Vehicle. [...] These were {{built for the}} use of staff officers and carried map tables, several telephones and other equipment, with space for a senior officer and his staff in command. As well as No. 19 sets, they also carried the high power and long range transmitter Wireless Sender BC-610. In this case they still carried the small 300 W charging set, but also a 3 kW generator set, usually an American-made Onan. Most radio use would be made when established as a temporary headquarters with long-wire aerials rigged, in which case the generator set would be used dismounted. When on the move, or {{during the course of a}} battle, the low-power radios could still be used from batteries, with vertical <b>whip</b> <b>aerials.</b> The small charging set could be used to recharge these, with less effort and also less noise to give away a position.|$|R
5000|$|Rides and attractions in the {{densely packed}} Electric Park include {{a roller coaster}} (one was called the Derby Racer; another {{featured}} {{a sign that said}} [...] "Trip Thru the Clouds - Detroit's Greatest Ride"; others that appeared in the park were the Big Dipper, the Bobs, and the Dare Devil), Ferris wheel, an interactive simulation of the Johnstown Flood, a Shoot-the-Chutes around which the rest of the park is configured, a <b>Whip</b> ride, <b>aerial</b> swings, various other mechanical rides, live entertainment (including acrobats and aerialists) performing in front of a bank of bleacher seats that dominated one side of the park), a riverfront pier, a coliseum, picnic facilities, and the Palais de Danse ballroom built (in 1912) {{over the edge of the}} water of the Detroit River. Another dance hall, Palace Gardens, was destroyed in a May 1911 blaze; the Coliseum and the pier and boardwalk (site of the park's concession stands) burned down ten years later. Before the fire, the Pier Ballroom and the Ramona were popular places for dancing; afterwards, the nearby Merry Gardens Ballroom kept drawing crowds even after the demise of the park.|$|R
5000|$|FuG 16 Z, ZE and ZY: These {{sets were}} {{airborne}} VHF transceivers used in single-seat fighter aircraft for R/T and W/T communications, and {{were also used}} for ground fixes and DF homing on ground stations when {{used in conjunction with}} the FuG 10P or FuG 10ZY. Installed for Bf 109G-3/G-4 and later, FW 190A-4 and later subtypes. Frequency Range was 38.5 to 42.3 MHz. The FuG 16ZY was also used for Y-Verfahren (Y-Control), in which aircraft were fitted up as Leitjäger or Fighter Formation Leaders that could be tracked and directed from the ground via special R/T equipment. Aircraft equipped with ZY were fitted with a Morane <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> array.

50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|E
50|$|Since UoSAT-2 (a.k.a. UO-11 or UoSAT-Oscar-11) is a {{sun-synchronous}} polar {{orbiting satellite}} {{in a low}} earth orbit, it passes over the poles every 98 minutes and a small handheld receiver with a simple <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> is sufficient {{to get a few}} minutes of excellent reception on each pass. By the end of 1987, while preparations were under way in the USSR, it was decided that the expedition would not take place at the South Pole, but instead at the North Pole; and the team would consist not only of Soviets, but a few experienced Canadian skiers as well. This time they would not only ski to the pole but continue their trek to Canada. The objective thus became to ski across the Arctic Ocean from the Siberian coast, via the North Pole, to the Canadian coast. The expedition started on March 3, 1988, and finished on June 1, when the skiers reached the small Ward Hunt Island just off Cape Columbia at Ellesmere Island, Northern Canada. The expedition was privately organized by 'Komsomolskaya Pravda', (the Soviet Youth Newspaper). Sponsors were the Soviet Youth Travel Agency 'Sputnik', and McDonald's restaurants of Canada. Canadian Project Manager was the Polar Bridge Company, a group organized by the Canadian skiers.|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects for}} Doctor Strange were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Method Studios, Framestore, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV, contributing to 1450 effects shots. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, <b>whips,</b> stalks and <b>aerial</b> 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|R
