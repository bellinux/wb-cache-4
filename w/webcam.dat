50|$|<b>Webcams</b> {{are known}} for their low {{manufacturing}} cost and their high flexibility, making them the lowest-cost form of videotelephony. Despite the low cost, the resolution offered at present (2015) is rather impressive, with low-end <b>webcams</b> offering resolutions of 320×240, medium <b>webcams</b> offering 640×480 resolution, and high-end <b>webcams</b> offering 1280×720 (aka 720p) or even 1920×1080 (aka 1080p) resolution.|$|R
40|$|Videoconferencing tools, like Skype, etc., {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used in language education worldwide. Despite assumed socio-affective and pedagogical benefits of using <b>webcams</b> in synchronous online language lessons, {{such as the}} feeling of co-presence or the possibilities of non-verbal communication, {{little is known about}} attitudes held by experienced online teachers towards <b>webcams</b> and their actual use of this tool during private online language lessons. This study interviews 20 experienced online language tutors and 20 adult students about their attitudes towards <b>webcams</b> and their use of <b>webcams.</b> The findings suggest that most teachers and students only used <b>webcams</b> at the start of their lessons for socio-affective reasons and discontinued the use of <b>webcams</b> after the first 2 – 3 weeks. Some common reasons for reducing the use of <b>webcams</b> were the perception of ‘webcamming’ as a more tiring mode, the feeling of self-consciousness and privacy concerns. The study calls for more research on the use of <b>webcams,</b> webcam-specific semio-pedagogical skills and suggests directions of future studies. 11 page(s...|$|R

The computer manages the image processing by tunable tracking rule to monitor and fast lock the object. Besides <b>webcams</b> and computer, this close-loop system contains two servo motors that control the <b>webcams</b> platform to keep the target centered in the monitor image. It can measure the depth of objects from two <b>webcams</b> by trigonometric function relationship. Finally, we make a virtual environment to verify the capability of this tracking system...|$|R

On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via <b>webcam</b> and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. Imran spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E
