Compression force tends to stabilize during cycling, retaining a residual force. Radial seals provide radial mounting pressure and mat erosion protection. V-seal is an exhaust gas blocking seal used with stainless steel knitted <b>wiremesh</b> support to prevent exhaust gas from bypassing the ceramic monolith in catalytic converter.

30|$|Huang and Kim (1993) {{conducted}} mine-back experiments, {{which show}} that a hydrofracture does not propagate linearly, but there are bi-wing fractures with several branches. The interaction between a hydraulic fracture (HF) and natural fracture (NF) {{can lead to the}} propagation of a fracture network (Jang et al. 2015; Cai et al. 2017), which is also influenced by heterogeneity of reservoir layers, irregular distribution of natural fractures and especially the in situ stress field (Olson 2008; Olson and Taleghani 2009). Weng et al. (2011) and Weng (2015) developed an unconventional fracture model (UFM) and considered stress field, the orientation of the NF and rock deformation, which is very powerful to describe the hydraulic fracture propagation using an unstructured grid. On the other hand, the <b>wiremesh</b> model (Xu et al. 2009, 2010; Meyer and Bazan 2011) utilizes two orthogonal sets of planar elements to represent the area of the fracture network and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), which is simple but effective for network modeling (Weng et al. 2011). Fracture spacing, the complexity of the fracture network and the grid’s properties are considered during the hydraulic fracture propagation. The <b>wiremesh</b> model can incorporate many factors into the mathematical model because it uses planar network density to model the SRV rather than an individual fracture. Hence, both the UFM and the <b>wiremesh</b> model have advantages for representing the fracture network geometry and the influences on production. A performance-based simulation model has the following characteristics: (1) the main factors influencing the fracturing performance are connected to the fracture model. (2) The complexity of the fracture network geometry is recognized, and the intersection of HF and NF is modeled. (3) The area of the fracture model (or the SRV) is connected to the microseismic (MS) monitoring to better utilize the events of the MS. (4) The model does not represent the real situation in the reservoir but idealizes the fracture network based on the theories and assumptions.|$|E
30|$|For better {{studying}} {{the performance of}} the fracture networks, analytical and numerical methods are applied. Olsen et al. studied the interactions between HFs and NFs and introduce a method to characterize the propagation of the complex fracture network considering the heterogeneity of the reservoir and the irregular distribution of natural fractures (Olson 2008; Olson and Arash 2009). Besides the analytical studies, numerical models are developed for further study and engineering simulation. The dual-porosity model, <b>wiremesh</b> model and unconventional fracture model (UFM) are three typical numerical models that can take the main characteristics of the fractures into consideration when simulating a complex fracture network. Dual-porosity model is first introduced by Warren and Root (Warren and Root 1963) to characterize the behavior of naturally fractured reservoirs and now widely applied in fracture modeling (Zimmerman et al. 1993; Du et al. 2010; Cipolla et al. 2010). The stimulated region is regarded as dual porosity or even multi-porosity, and the properties of the grids can be assigned independently. The <b>wiremesh</b> model is consisted of two perpendicular sets of vertical planar fractures, and it quantizes the complicated geological and engineering factors to the parameters controlling the propagation of the <b>wiremesh</b> network (Xu et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2010; Meyer and Lucas 2011). The properties of the planar fractures and their spacing are related to different engineering parameters even MSE, and the mechanical interactions between the fracturing fluid and fracture walls are its main consideration (Xu et al. 2010; Weng et al. 2011). However, the models above cannot display the fracture geometry and that is the reason UFM is developed (Weng et al. 2011; Weng 2015). The UFM mainly studies the interactions between the HFs and NFs and details the propagation of the fracture network within the unstructured grids. It couples the fracture geometry with the factors influencing the propagation such as the orientation of the NFs and the rock deformation.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} {{a new type of}} fracture model based on fractal geometry theory to study and simulate the fracture network generated by hydraulic fracturing. The model has advantages compared to the <b>wiremesh</b> and UFM approaches in that the geometry of the fracture network is related to several fractal parameters that can be adjusted with an understanding of geologic and engineering factors, as well as microseismic monitoring events. It is a type of performance-based model for characterizing the hydraulic fracture network. With FFM, both the propagation of the fracture network and the fractal controlling parameters can be specified and adjusted.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to develop {{improved}} models for the acoustic impedance of treatment panels at high frequencies, for application to subscale treatment designs. Effects that cause significant deviation of the impedance from simple geometric scaling are examined in detail, an improved high-frequency impedance model is developed, and the improved model is correlated with high-frequency impedance measurements. Only single-degree-of-freedom honeycomb sandwich resonator panels with either perforated sheet or "linear" <b>wiremesh</b> faceplates are considered. The objective is to understand those effects that cause the simple single-degree-of- freedom resonator panels to deviate at the higher-scaled frequency from the impedance that would be obtained at the corresponding full-scale frequency. This will allow the subscale panel to be designed to achieve a specified impedance spectrum over at least a limited range of frequencies. An advanced impedance prediction model has been developed that accounts for some of the known effects at high frequency that have previously been ignored as a small source of error for full-scale frequency ranges...|$|E

Canning is the packaging of ceramic catalysts and particulate filters {{which are used}} as an aftertreatment system for Gasoline and Diesel engines. The thesis was conducted at Scania CV AB. In the canning process a ceramic fiber mat is first sleeved around the ceramic substrate. The substrate and mat are then canned in a metal housing. The thesis starts of with describing different canning methods. Advantages and application of the methods is described. Then the different components in the canning system are described. Different support mats, catalysts, particulate filters, <b>wiremesh</b> and steels for the housing are discussed. The method for calculating which mat pressure is needed is described. How to calculate holding forces from backpressure and acceleration are described. Temperature measurements are discussed. How the design program works {{and how to use}} the program is then discussed. The major problem in canning is poor manufacturing tolerances of the components. Thermal expansion will influence the robustness of the system. The measured temperatures were high due to the filter and catalyst being enclosed inside the muffler. This combined could lead to substrate slippage. The tolerances could mean that high pressure occur during caning that could lead to substrate cracking during canning...|$|E
30|$|In fact, {{of either}} <b>wiremesh</b> model or the UFM, {{the main focus}} is the {{description}} on the fracture propagation; the conceptual models mentioned by Jones et al. (2013), Chen et al. 2016), studying {{the influence of the}} fracture complexity and connectivity on the typical production curves, fail to consider the fracture bifurcation. So in this paper, we would like to introduce a method based on the fractal geometry theory to characterize the fracture network and to analyze the well performance. The fractal geometry theory was put forward by Mandelbrot (1979) and has been applied to rock mechanics since 1982 (Xie 1993; Wang et al. 2015 a, b) utilized the iterated function system (IFS) to study the bifurcation performance of the fracture network. According to the fractal geometry theory, the fracture network we generated can be both bifurcated and multi-leveled, the fracture geometry can be related to few fractal controlling parameters, and these lead to the main advantages of the model: (1) characterizing the bifurcation feature of the fracture geometry; (2) quantifying the connectivity and complexity of the fracture network for analyzing; and (3) classifying the fractures into different levels to differ the main fractures and secondary fractures.|$|E
