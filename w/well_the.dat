5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>well</b> in <b>the</b> {{book is a}} stone {{well that}} looks like a [...] "pile of rocks", making in closer in {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> in <b>The</b> Ring Virus (1999) and The Ring (2002), than to <b>the</b> <b>well</b> in <b>the</b> 1998 film.|$|R
50|$|Typically, in most {{water and}} {{wastewater}} <b>wells,</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> itself with its ladders, pumps and other metal installations, provides a ground return.

5|$|Some {{chemical}} {{differences exist}} among the Negriales rocks, the Lastarria lavas, and the Lastarria pyroclastics. The Negriales rocks are the richest in silicon dioxide, and their trace element composition sharply diverges as <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> Negriales rocks may originate from parental magmas {{that are different}} from the main Lastarria magmas.|$|E
5|$|Students run the college's radio station, WDOM, as <b>well</b> <b>the</b> on-campus {{television}} station, PCTV. The {{station was}} ranked the 11th-best college {{radio station in}} the country by the Princeton Review in 2011. The student-run campus newspaper since 1935 has been The Cowl.|$|E
50|$|Aquifers {{are also}} an {{important}} source for the groundwater that feeds into <b>wells.</b> <b>The</b> groundwater must go through these aquifers to get to <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> {{has an effect on}} <b>the</b> aquifers as <b>well.</b> Pumping through much water through these wells can cause a cone of depression around <b>the</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} as <b>the</b> number of <b>wells</b> increases, <b>the</b> {{production}} first increases and then decreases. When <b>the</b> number of <b>wells</b> is <b>the</b> same, the initial production increases rapidly, and after reaching the peak value, the production is slowly reduced. This makes the cumulative production {{increase in the}} early stage. When <b>the</b> number of <b>wells</b> exceeds <b>the</b> number of reasonable production <b>wells,</b> <b>the</b> cumulative output gradually becomes flat. Therefore, there is a reasonable well pattern density (reasonable number of <b>wells)</b> in <b>the</b> development of the gas reservoir. When exceeding the reasonable number of <b>wells,</b> <b>the</b> cumulative production tends to be stable and the economic benefits reduce.|$|R
5000|$|There is a <b>well</b> near <b>the</b> tank. There {{are several}} stories about <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> Such as, when any {{ceremony}} {{was held at}} any home of that area and he any virgin girl came to <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and told <b>the</b> <b>well</b> about <b>the</b> ceremony of her home, them within a few moments golden plates, spoons, bowls etc. would be found beside <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> After using they had to return those things and those things would be vanished after keeping <b>the</b> beside <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> So, <b>the</b> tank was named as [...] "Kumari Dighi" [...] (Tank of Virgin).|$|R
5|$|The Jabala Upanishad {{influenced}} other scholarly {{works as}} <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> Jivanmukti-viveka, {{written by the}} 14th-century Advaita Vedanta scholar and Vijayanagara Empire mentor Vidyaranya, refers to the Jabala Upanishad while describing those who achieve living liberation.|$|E
5|$|The body {{structure}} of domesticated rats {{differs from that}} of a wild rat as <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail than that of its undomesticated counterpart. They are generally smaller with sharper facial features as well.|$|E

30|$|The {{delay in}} the oil {{production}} in off-set SAGD cases lasts significantly longer than that of conventional SAGD. This long-lasting delay {{is the result of}} the horizontal spacing of <b>the</b> <b>wells.</b> <b>The</b> more the horizontal spacing between <b>the</b> <b>wells,</b> <b>the</b> more the inclination from the vertical orientation between them (if the vertical spacing is constant) and in turn, the later the communication between <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> is established. It is obvious that the vertical spacing between <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> also has a direct relationship with the communication establishment period. However, the later parameter’s effect is much less intense compared to that of horizontal distance.|$|R
3000|$|... ▪ The heat {{extraction}} with <b>the</b> horizontal <b>wells</b> with <b>the</b> injector at {{the bottom}} is significantly better than the heat extraction with <b>the</b> vertical <b>wells.</b> In <b>the</b> case with horizontal <b>wells,</b> <b>the</b> temperature remains constant for the first 15  years of injection and then starts dropping {{at a rate of}} 0.7 degree C/year from 15 to 20  years and at the rate of 1.9 degree C/year during the remaining injection time.

50|$|According to {{the legend}} of Cormac mac Art, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> stands in <b>the</b> hall of the fairy king Manannán mac Lir. In one legend, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> was home to the one Salmon of Wisdom until it was caught by the poet Finn Eces. Nine sacred hazels of wisdom {{surround}} <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> blooming and fruiting in the same hour. Eating the hazelnuts that fell into <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> drinking <b>the</b> <b>well</b> water when <b>the</b> hazelnuts fell in, or eating the salmon that ate the hazelnuts granted knowledge and poetic inspiration. <b>The</b> <b>well</b> was accordingly sought out by many poets and philosophers.|$|R
5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated Ethyl (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by rail to Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as <b>well.</b> <b>The</b> company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a marshalling yard for exchanging freight wagons.|$|E
5|$|Albertite, {{a type of}} asphalt, {{was first}} found in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian {{geologist}} Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene. Over 200,000tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years.

5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as <b>well,</b> <b>the</b> existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E

Apart from <b>the</b> Wireline <b>Well</b> Tractor, a Coiled tubing Well Tractor has been manufactured, which instead of running on wireline is fluid-driven.

5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic workers were dominant.
