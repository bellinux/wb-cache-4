25|$|Upon {{finishing}} his stint with Second City in 1988, Mochrie's career <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while as he {{spent some time}} with his new wife and child. In 1989, he auditioned for the new British Channel 4 improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but did not make the cut. Mochrie has stated that the audition was a good learning experience because while improv is about setting other people up to be funny, auditions should be about giving yourself the chance to stand out. He moved to Los Angeles the following year, and again auditioned for Whose Line, this time making the cut and was asked to fly to London. He appeared on one episode and was again let go. The third time he auditioned, he earned a regular spot on the show. He spent seven years as a regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and remained a cast member until the show's end in 1998.|$|E
500|$|During the insurgency's Ramadan Offensive, a {{military}} Chinook transport helicopter carrying 32 soldiers {{was shot down}} with an SA-7 missile near Fallujah on 2 November. Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded. Following the shootdown, Fallujah <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months. On 5 November, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early {{the next year and}} would take over Anbar Province. As the Marines prepared to move in, there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area, although the only real problem was Fallujah. Some Marine commanders, like Major General James Mattis and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy, criticized the Army's tactics as [...] "hard-nosed" [...] and [...] "humiliating the Sunni population", promising that the Marines would act differently. Late that November, Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province, after they came under fire from insurgents inside, air support was called in and hit the farm, after it was cleared; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters. [...] Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December capture of Saddam Hussein. The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar: instead of weakening the insurgency, many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam. Saddam's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred for Saddam. As Saddam loyalists were killed or captured, leadership positions went to AQI-affiliated hardliners such as Abdullah Abu Azzam al-Iraqi, who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004. While the Ba'ath Party continued {{to play a major role}} in the insurgency, the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a jihad against American forces.|$|E
60|$|Laura <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, {{and then}} with an effort looked up.|$|E
500|$|We’ve <b>been</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while now. We’ve {{had a lot}} of {{thinking}} and talking to do.|$|R
60|$|We three--that is, Sir Henry Curtis, Captain Good, and myself--went and {{sat by the}} wheel, and <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while.|$|R
60|$|When all had <b>been</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{and there}} were only stars to see him, he crept out and looked about him.|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment or}} two, {{then he took}} his pipe {{out of his mouth}} again, and chuckled.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems so," [...] Grahame answered, and <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, languidly {{watching}} {{the girl and}} wondering how far his statement was true.|$|E
6000|$|Olivia {{gave him}} a keen glance and <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments. Then she said, [...] "It's possible! You feel you ought to thank her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{want to know}}," [...] {{said the}} young mule, who had <b>been</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time--"what I want to know is, {{why we have to}} fight at all." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> space. The only {{movement}} in the night was the faint gambolling of starlight on the water. The last person had passed in black silhouette {{between them and the}} sea.|$|R
6000|$|When Marston {{had gone}} Flora {{sat down on}} the bench. She was pale and trembled. Wyndham, looking very grim, leaned against the wall. They <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment or two, and then he asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|She made {{a sort of}} gulping {{noise and}} <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, holding me very tightly to her heart with her worn, long hands [...] .|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few moments}} and Mrs. Austin saw her shot had reached its mark. Her mood changed {{and she was}} sorry for the girl; Betty had pluck and was very frank.|$|E
6000|$|Dick <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or}} two, {{and then looked}} up. [...] "You {{remember}} reading the French romance the night we reached the telegraph shack! Did you see Franklin Dearham's name in the book?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's good to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> change," [...] Gore said. [...] "When I'm {{with you}} I feel that I needn't talk unless I want to. That's a relief, because it's when I feel least that I talk the most. You're tranquilizing." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} {{returned}} to the vicarage and Beatrice had heard Effie her prayers and tucked her up in her small white bed, she went down to the gate to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while before supper. Geoffrey had not yet come in.|$|R
50|$|The Frankish {{subjects}} in the frontiers <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade, then the Sorbs revolted in 816, and were quickly followed by the Obotrites, led by Slavomir, Thrasco's successor. Slavomir was however abandoned by his people, and by 818, Cedragus, Thrasco's son, inherited {{the leadership of the}} Obotrites.|$|R
60|$|Flora {{told him}} and after she stopped he <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time. The {{moonlight}} touched his face and she saw the lines get deeper. The old Commodore was deeply moved, but she was glad {{he did not look}} stern.|$|E
6000|$|Betty <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments. She {{looked tired}} and Kit {{imagined}} she knew {{all he knew}} about the pressure of the crowd. Then she said, [...] "If only we didn't push! Perhaps there's room enough, and we might make things better." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few moments}} and looked about, {{knitting}} his brows. The surf was louder, {{the sky was}} red, and the mists glimmered, as if a glow shone through. Betty waited and said nothing. She had waited long, but Kit had returned to her.|$|E
50|$|The Music Tapes <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} years before Music Tapes For Clouds and Tornadoes was {{released}} on August 19, 2008 via Merge Records. It contained 14 songs, two with videos. Some of these songs existed back {{around the time of}} 1st Imaginary Symphony for Nomad.|$|R
6000|$|... "You cowardly lot of bullies," [...] I {{have wanted}} to cry, [...] "are you not ashamed of yourselves? A hundred and forty of you against one, and that one a still {{beautiful}} and, comparatively speaking, young lady. <b>Be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute--can't you? Give the poor girl a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Euphemia {{told me of}} this, laughing, {{and then}} she became {{suddenly}} grave. [...] "Do you know, dear," [...] she said, [...] "Jane said one thing I did not like. She had <b>been</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William is a lot above me, ma'am, ain't he?'" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{time and}} Marston was {{satisfied}} to smoke and study her. It had got dark, but {{the fire was}} bright and touched her face while she sat still, as if lost in concentrated thought. Marston thought her beautiful and she had beauty, but her beauty was not her strongest charm.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie {{gave him}} a quick glance. His face was {{thoughtful}} and he frowned. She <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment or two, and then smiled. [...] "I do not know him well. He was at the Woolsworth Store, but his was a better post than mine, and we didn't often meet. In fact, I don't think I liked him much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having been thus answered, he <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. She {{had slipped}} again {{out of her}} chair to kneel beside him; it seemed the only place from which she could find courage for her answers. He put his hand, that had lost its brown, on her hair. At that she plucked up spirit to ask: ...|$|E
5000|$|Things <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{while and}} {{during this time}} a {{daughter}} named Increase and a son named Jacob were born. After this last child he was again jailed for the [...] "faithfulness of his religious convictions". Fortunately he was released {{with the help of}} Margaret Fell who had some influence with Charles II.|$|R
60|$|The game flickered up {{and down}} between goal-post and goal-post, and the black ponies were getting more {{confident}} as they felt they had {{the legs of the}} others. The ball was hit out of a little scrimmage, and Benami and The Rabbit followed it, Faiz-Ullah only too glad to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant.|$|R
60|$|The others <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment or}} two. They {{felt they had}} got a hint, but the hint was vague. Somebody must take the hounds and they could not. They {{resolved}} to leave the thing to Herries; {{he was young and}} his remarks would not carry so much weight. Besides, he knew Mordaunt well.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment or}} two, but Mrs. Austin waited {{and he went}} on: [...] "Well, I have done what I undertook, and Don Arturo {{has given me a}} better post. Perhaps the post is not very good, but I am going to ask Olivia if, when I have made some progress, she will marry me." ...|$|E
60|$|Jim said nothing. It {{looked as}} if the little faded woman who had been {{occupied}} about the store all day had qualities he had not imagined, although he now remembered he had sometimes got a hint of reserved force. All <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute or two while he mused, and then they heard steps and Jake came up.|$|E
6000|$|Chisholm <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment or}} two, and then resumed: [...] "That is not {{altogether}} what I meant; in fact, it's hard to state frankly what I do mean. I like Harry Wyndham. He's clever, resolute, {{and a good}} sportsman, but {{when he wanted to}} marry Flora I hesitated. Well, your story has given me some comfort. You have been with Wyndham and are satisfied. One can trust you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Words of indignation {{arose from}} the circle, {{and one or two}} shouted, [...] "Run him out! He has no {{business}} here." [...] But Clarke cried out, in a commanding voice: [...] "Remain where you <b>are,</b> friends! <b>Be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes." [...] They obeyed, and Serviss was about to withdraw when Pratt confronted him. [...] "What do you mean? Do you want to kill the psychic?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{remarked that}} Ignosi had swum to power through blood. The old chief shrugged his shoulders. [...] "Yes," [...] he answered; [...] "but the Kukuana people {{can only be}} kept cool by letting their blood flow sometimes. Many are killed, indeed, but the women are left, and others must soon grow up to take the places of the fallen. After this the land would <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped abruptly, and Jake heard <b>a</b> step. They <b>were</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, {{and then}} Tom Shanks came round {{a corner of}} the bank and stood looking at them. Jim's face was cut and rather white, but the stains on his clothes {{indicated}} that he had been working among wet soil. Jake gave Shanks a keen glance and thought he looked surprised, as if he had not expected to see Jim there.|$|R
