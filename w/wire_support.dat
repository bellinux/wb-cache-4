500|$|The film's Yosemite {{scenes were}} all shot on location. Long shots of Kirk scaling the {{mountain}} were filmed with stunt doubles, while Shatner's closer shots had {{him on a}} fiberglass set positioned {{in front of the}} camera, with the real mountains visible in the background. Aided by two trainers, Shatner had spent weeks at the Paramount lot, learning to climb a wooden replica. Laszlo scouted out a tall peak on which the production created a rock face with safety net. The overhead shot gave the impression Kirk was climbing at a great height, while unnatural background features such as swimming pools were camouflaged. In the scene, Spock watches Kirk's ascent, and saves him when he slips and falls using levitating boots. Most of the shots framed Nimoy from the waist up; in these scenes the actor was supported by a crane that gave the appropriate [...] "float" [...] to achieve the effect. Bluescreen footage of Shatner falling was shot later at Paramount and composited, while stuntman Ken Bates set a record for the highest American descender fall by plummeting off El Capitan— with a <b>wire</b> <b>support</b> rig— for long shots. In reviewing the dailies of the first two days of shooting, the production realized that a pine tree in the frame during Kirk and Spock's mountain dialogue ruined the illusion of height, while a shot of Shatner clinging to the face of El Capitan appeared muddy due to clouds obscuring the sun and ruining the depth of field. The scenes had to be reshot later.|$|E

50|$|By 1985, the MBTA {{was finally}} in a {{position}} to retire its PCCs from the Green Line as the issues plaguing the Boeings were resolved to a point where a majority of the cars operated reliably and the MBTA placed an order for additional light rail cars from Kinki Sharyo, which were delivered the following year. With the PCC cars retired, the Green Line operating fleet had become exclusively pantograph equipped, eliminating the need for the wire frogs that were used to guide the trolley poles' current collectors at switches. The overhead catenary received additional upgrades, the first of which used primarily span <b>wire</b> <b>support</b> from the existing line poles. The second upgrade used many more bracket arms. Due to the added weight of the new overhead construction, side guy wires were added to many existing line poles or a horizontal beam was installed across a pair of line poles.|$|E

5000|$|On Tuesday, March 18, 2008 at 2:30 pm Pacific Standard Time the {{replacement}} tower collapsed while under construction. The tower was about 300 feet tall (the final height {{was to be}} 684 feet) when a guy <b>wire</b> <b>support</b> failed, causing the tower to tip over the opposite direction. There were no major injuries, and only limited collateral damage. The reason for the failure {{is assumed to be}} a combination of factors, including the much higher per unit weight of the new 84" [...] cross-section tower, compared to the 1948 tower which had a 42" [...] cross-section, and the inadequacy of the 1948 pier and guy wire terminations, one of which had previously been modified to a cantilever design to facilitate the passage of vehicles under that termination (and, it was the cantilever termination which catastrophically failed during this erection attempt). All of these structural components were replaced or strengthened in preparation for erection of the third tower, which is identical in design to the (failed) replacement tower.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{electrostatic}} septa are {{the most}} critical elements of the main ring extrac-tion system and the beam splitting stations at Fermilab. 1 p 2 Operating experience since the first extracted beam in 1972 has indica-ted several improvements needed over the original septa for both extraction (single cathode) and beam splitting (double cathode) A second generation of septa, now being im-plemented, is described here. Original Fermilab Septa These consist of several modules (4 for beam splitter and 5 for extractor) placed in line to give the required lo-foot length. The modules are accurately aligned inside an aluminum box with a thin stainless steel vat uum skin. It was eventually learned that the alignment is degraded when the vacuum skin is welded on. A typical effective thickness is. 030 ” although the aligyment before welding is accurate to. OOl”. The resulting extraction efficiency for slow spill is limited to about 90 %. The wire plane consists of. 002 ” tung-sten wires with a. 050 ” spacing. The wires are tensioned on an accurately machined aluminum frame. Each wire is hard-soldered to a coil spring on both ends and tensions are individually set at 300 grams. Since one lo-foot septum contains 2400 wires, the assembly is very tedious. Both failure at the solder joints and beam-induced wire breakage have been seri-ous problems, resulting in shorted septa. The welded vacuum skin makes disassembly for repair inefficient. Second Generation Septa The septa now being implemented at Fermilab are characterized by: 1.; 2 one-piece <b>wire</b> <b>support</b> frame, 10 feet long. 2. A simplified wire fastening tech-nique. 3.

40|$|Wire-scanning beam profile {{monitors}} {{are used}} at the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) for emittance preservation control and beam optics optimization. Twenty such scanners have proven most useful for this purpose and have performed a total of 1. 5 million scans in the 4 to 6 years since their installation. Most of the essential scanners are equipped with 20 to 40 m tungsten wires. SLC bunch intensities and sizes often exceed 210 7 particles/m 2 (3 C/m 2).

40|$|Devices for venous {{cannulation}} {{have seen}} significant progress over time: the original, rigid steel cannulas have evolved toward flexible plastic cannulas with <b>wire</b> <b>support</b> that prevents kinking, very thin walled wire wound cannulas allowing for percutaneous application, {{and all sorts}} of combinations. In contrast to all these rectilinear venous cannula designs, which present the same cross-sectional area over their entire intravascular path, the smartcanula concept of "collapsed insertion and expansion in situ" is the logical next step for venous access. Automatically adjusting cross-sectional area up to a pre-determined diameter or the vessel lumen provides optimal flow and ease of use for both, insertion and removal. Smartcanula performance was assessed in a small series of patients (76 +/- 17 kg) undergoing redo procedures. The calculated target pump flow (2. 4 L/min/m 2) was 4. 42 +/- 61 L/ min. Mean pump flow achieved during cardiopulmonary bypass was 4. 84 +/- 87 L/min or 110 % of the target. Reduced atrial chatter, kink resistance in situ, and improved blood drainage despite smaller access orifice size, are the most striking advantages of this new device. The benefits of smart cannulation are obvious in remote cannulation for limited access cardiac surgery, but there are many other cannula applications where space is an issue, and that is where smart cannulation is most effective...|$|E
