The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E

"The most {{disturbing}} thing about The Patriot {{is not just}} that German director Roland Emmerich (director of Independence Day) and his screenwriter Robert Rodat (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British, Canadian (Juno Beach) and other Allied troops in the Normandy landings from his script for Saving Private Ryan) depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to war crimes carried out by German troops—particularly the SS in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda....They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradour—and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters....So it's no <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people." ...|$|E

[...] Upon receiving word that 20,000 Edomites were marching on Jerusalem, ben Hanan ordered the gates shut against them, and the walls guarded. Jesus, one of the elder high priests, made a speech from the walls, denouncing the Zealots as robbers and telling the Edomites to throw down their arms. Simon, son of Cathlas, one of Idumean commanders, quieted the tumult of his own men and answered: [...] "I can no longer <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patrons of liberty are under custody in the temple, since there are those that shut the gates of our common city to their own nation, {{and at the same time}} are prepared to admit the Romans into it; nay, perhaps are disposed to crown the gates with garlands at their coming, while they speak to the Idumeans from their own towers, and enjoin them to throw down their arms which they have taken up for the preservation of its liberty...." ...|$|E

[...] Referring to the rapid growth of crime in northern Kinta, Walker remarked:No <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crime has increased, as increase it must, with a mining population of Chinese, a race that knows no repose, that settles only for the moment where money is to be made with the greatest ease, that would rob their best friends if they themselves should have lost their savings at the gaming table.Crime with such a population as this means progress, and although a check has been given to it by raising the Force to its utmost capacity, at the sacrifice of other parts of the state, strengthening the detective branch, and paying judiciously for information, crime must arise, and as long as a fair number of discoveries are made of crimes most difficult to detect in a country where escape is so easy, and a criminal can with comparative ease conceal himself, it is all that can be expected.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{the next}} day, Kennedy and Scanlon {{went down to}} the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to {{attended}} to camp duty. He fired two shots out of his fowling piece at a pair of parrots. These shots were heard by Kelly, who was on the lookout for the police. At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, [...] "Bail up; throw up your arms." [...] McIntyre testified that Kelly took his fowling piece, and that all the gang members were armed. (Kelly stated that only two had guns.) Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed. Lonigan went for cover behind a tree and, at the same time, put his hand on his revolver. Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell to the ground and said, [...] "Oh Christ, I am shot." [...] He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, [...] "What a pity; what made the fool run?" [...] Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied.
