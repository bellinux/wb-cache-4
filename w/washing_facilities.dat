5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the junction of Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E

5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own <b>washing</b> <b>facilities.</b> When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|Poole's Guildhall {{has played}} a varied part {{in the history of}} the town. A Grade II* listed {{building}}, the Guildhall was built in 1761 at a cost of £2,250. The new building included an open market house on the ground floor and a courtroom and offices for the town council on the first floor and has also been used as a Court of Record, Magistrates' Court, Court of Admiralty and a venue for Quarter Sessions. Between 1819 and 1821 the building was consecrated as a Parish Church while the old St. James Church was pulled down and replaced with the present church. During the Second World War the building was used as a canteen and meeting room for American soldiers prior to the invasion of France. The showers and <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> installed at this time were later converted into public baths which were used until the 1960s. The building was converted for use as the town museum between 1971 and 1991 but stood empty for the next 16 years. After a renovation project funded by Poole Borough Council, the restored Guildhall opened in June 2007 as a Register Office for weddings, civil partnerships and other civic ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AU£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a calorifier, the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E

5|$|When it opened, {{the station}} {{had a single}} platform, {{on the west side}} of the track. Road access was through a large {{forecourt}} to the west from Clanage Road / Rownham Hill, now the A369. There was a two-storey building facing the road, the ground floor of which had a single long room, partitioned into a waiting room, booking office and station master's office. The ground floor also housed a coal-fired boiler and <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> while upstairs was spacious living accommodation accessed by a private staircase. A single north-facing bay platform for goods vans was at the north end of the station. The station was noted as having an excellent garden alongside the platform. The nearby Rownham Ferry allowed passengers to cross the river to Hotwells and Clifton. Services on the Portishead railway were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, with six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays. The operation of these transferred to the Great Western in 1876, when they took over the Bristol and Exeter, and in 1884 the Great Western took ownership of the Bristol and Portishead. The station was visited by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1878.|$|E
25|$|Northfield was a quickly {{developing}} {{area and}} the committee focussed on providing baths for it. It was decided to build the baths at Bristol Road South. As the area was predominantly new build, most houses contained their own <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> thus removing the necessity for <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> at the baths.|$|E

25|$|A {{decision-maker}} acts in an {{ultra vires}} manner {{when it did}} not have the power that it purported to have, and therefore there was no basis in law for the impugned action. In Attorney General v.

Hence, a laundry service implemented by the Corporation was ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|The {{pavilion}} is a white, rectangular shaped building housing changing facilities, <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> storage facilities, {{a kitchen}} and a bar. The first floor is significantly {{smaller than the}} ground floor and is used for home team changing. The bulk of the ground floor is consumed by a bar and associated communal area where cricket teas are served and eaten. The building is serviced with terrestrial and satellite television as well as Wifi.|$|E
25|$|ONEA has {{substantially}} {{invested in}} sanitation by helping households to build such shower and <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> connected to soakaway pits, {{as well as}} improved latrines. ONEA subsidizes these facilities {{with the support of}} international donors and with the cash generated by the sanitation surcharge on water bills. The grants provided by ONEA amount on average to 40 {{percent of the cost of}} facilities, thus making them affordable to households. Sewerage plays a marginal role in Burkina Faso. There are only 235 connections to sewers in the entire country, all in Ouagadougou.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{hand washing}} with soap {{is recognized as}} a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition. However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors. For example, in most of rural Africa handwashing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build handwashing stations. However, low handwashing rates rather can also {{be the result of}} engrained habits rather than {{due to a lack of}} soap or water.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, however, reformers in Britain {{were coming to}} {{appreciate}} the link between sanitation and public health. The discovery by the London doctor John Snow {{of the link between}} cholera and sewage-contaminated water led to improvements in water supplies in many British towns and cities. At the same time, the military establishment came to better appreciate the importance of soldiers' living conditions after the experiences of the Crimean War, in which far more died of disease than in battle. This led to improvements being made in the sanitary conditions of the barracks of Gibraltar, through providing better <b>washing</b> <b>facilities</b> and drainage. It also became apparent that Gibraltar's water supplies would be inadequate in the event of another prolonged siege.|$|E
25|$|Pay {{was below}} {{industry}} standard, {{and there was}} no pension scheme. Working conditions could be bad; for example, the engine crews had to work half-cab locomotives tender-first half the time. There was no canteen or <b>washing</b> <b>facilities,</b> and conditions in the workshops at Shepherdswell were very primitive. Nobody seems to have noted any staff toilet there. However, narrative evidence suggests {{that there was a lot}} of spare time on the job, although tales of staff drinking beer in pubs while their trains waited (which would entail instant dismissal on the main line) are probably urban legends. It seems that the staff used the pubs near the railway at Shepherdswell, Eythorne, Woodnesborough and Port Richborough as places to wait over and to have their lunches in the absence of any company facilities (tragically, of these only one of the two station pubs at Shepherdswell survives).|$|E
5000|$|... 1999: The company merged American Wash Services, {{a company}} that was engaged in {{operating}} car <b>wash</b> <b>facilities,</b> into a wholly owned subsidiary of Mace Security International. Mace purchased over 50 car and truck washes in 1999 and 2000.|$|R
50|$|In today's modern car <b>wash</b> <b>facilities,</b> whether tunnel, in-bay {{automatic}} or self-serve, soaps {{and other}} cleaning solutions used {{are designed to}} loosen and eliminate dirt and grime. This {{is in contrast to}} earlier times, when hydrofluoric acid, a hazardous chemical, was commonly used as a cleaning agent in the industry by some operators. There has been a strong move in the industry to shift to safer cleaning solutions. Most car <b>wash</b> <b>facilities</b> are required by law to treat and/or reuse their water and may be required to maintain waste-water discharge permits, in contrast to unregulated facilities or even driveway washing (at one's home), where waste-water can end up in the storm drain and, eventually, in streams, rivers and lakes.|$|R
