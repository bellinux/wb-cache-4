2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was revealed to be a catastrophic failure of the engine's third stage turbine disk, resulting from a loss of operating clearance between the disk and the third stage inner sealing ring. Improper positioning of the turbine rotor, use of the wrong type of tool and <b>worn</b> <b>parts</b> included in the engine assembly process were blamed for that loss of clearance. The CAB accident report states that the inspector on duty during the reinstallation of the turbine rotor [...] "signed off on work he had not inspected".|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of the Breakring vertical shaft impactor was investigated mathematically and experimentally. In particular, {{the performance of the}} crusher, the action of solids and air in the impeller and the mechanism responsible for the localised abrasion of the impeller <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> were investigated. Computer programs were developed, which modelled the performance of the Breakring for impellers having simple, idealised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> profiles. Contour plots were produced, which illustrated the dependence of impeller power, absolute particle exit speed and anvil angle for normal impact on the <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> sweep angle and the coefficient of friction between the feed material and the <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The significance of the contours was investigated. A computer program was developed, which modelled the action of a single particle in the Breakring impeller for <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> having various complex profiles. The results indicated that the cause of the localised <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> abrasion was the reattachment of feed material to the <b>wear</b> <b>part,</b> following separation at the downstream end of the depression caused by action of material after entry to the impeller. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by the profiles of abraded <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> and various other factors. A full-scale model impeller was constructed. The flow of air in the model and, following failure of the model, the flow of air and solids in a prototype impeller were investigated by a surface flow visualisation technique and high speed cinematography. The results neither verified the wear-mechanism outlined above nor indicated any other wear-mechanism. It was concluded that the wear mechanism indicated by the mathematical modelling was accurate and that there is no indication of abrasion by airborne fines...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> {{with respect to the}} different heat treatments applied have been investigated. Two different alloys and a total of nine different heat treatment procedures were tested. Alloy 35 M 13 B have been tested with respect to tempering temperature and represents one <b>wear</b> <b>part.</b> The other <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB have been tested with respect to both tempering temperatures and effect of direct hardening. The main goal of this work has been to improve the understanding of how the steel alloys used for the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> responds to different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. During this work both alloys were tested using the following test methods; charpy impact testing, tensile testing and Vickers hardness testing. From production, <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB as currently produced and when directly hardened was to be investigated for its mechanical properties, thus alloy 30 M 12 CB was heat treated at different temperatures with the aim to find two heat treatments that would match the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> pulled from production. The two chosen temperatures for 30 M 12 CB were 850 *C representing the current production and 1100 *C representing direct hardening. Then, <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> 30 M 12 CB and 35 M 13 B was heat treated accordingly and tempered. The current tempering temperature of 220 *C was compared with 180 *C and no tempering. Charpy test specimens and tensile test specimens for 35 M 13 B and 30 M 12 CB were then tested with three parallels. The results recorded was then compared with respect to mechanical properties for the different tempering temperatures and heat treatments. For all parts the strength increased slightly by lowering tempering temperature from 220 *C to 180 *C. No tempering did not affect the ductility of 35 M 13 B and improved the strength and hardness for this alloy, in contrast no tempering left 30 M 12 CB- 850 very brittle. Directly hardening <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> 30 M 12 CB will result in a slight reduction in quality, however the difference in quality will likely be slightly greater than the results from this work indicates. It is reasonable to say that reducing the temperature of tempering for 35 M 13 B may be preferable as it saves space, reduces production time and cost, while maintaining or increasing the hardness and strength of the material. Further, the slight reduction in ductility should not lead to brittle fractures and thus may not affect the end product negatively...|$|R

40|$|This thesis has {{attempted}} to reduce costs associated with <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> in test equipment at Ericsson’s master and industrialization center (MIC) in Kista. Two different cases have been pursued, and each {{has been designed to}} follow a, for the purpose, adapted version of the design research methodology (DRM). The adapted model was presented and its use in both cases was additionally evaluated. Both cases were based on products that already have been launched and are used in production. In order to avoid expensive changes to surrounding equipment, incremental product development was chosen in both cases. The first case focused on test equipment used in the production of digital units for radio base stations. After the <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> of this test equipment were examined, it was found that a plastic detail was manufactured through milling and as a result was quite expensive. The plastic detail was redesigned so that it could be manufactured using the injection molding process instead. This resulted in an estimated cost reduction of 48 %. The second case focused on <b>wear</b> <b>parts</b> of test fixtures used in the production of radio filters, also used in Ericsson’s radio base stations. A more process-oriented view was adopted in this case and parameters believed to be causing added wear such as positional and angular misalignment were examined further. Tolerance chains for each <b>wear</b> <b>part</b> in the assembled test fixture were calculated to determine the degrees of possible misalignment. The resulting data did however not correlate with each <b>wear</b> <b>part’s</b> individual <b>wear</b> interval, and no concrete cost reductive improvements could be delivered. Instead suggestions which can lead to further cost reductions in the long term were presented. The model used to develop improvements for these two cases was found to have helped the process in both cases, however further research of this model is recommended in order to determine if it is suitable for these types of projects in genera...|$|R
