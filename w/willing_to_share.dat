5|$|Pope Paul III claimed some {{rights in}} Klis, and in September, 1536, {{there was talk}} in the Curia of {{strengthening}} the defenses of the fortress. The Pope notified Ferdinand that he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the costs of maintaining a proper garrison in Klis. Ferdinand I did send aid to Klis and was apparently hopeful of holding the fortress, when the Turks again laid siege to it. Ferdinand I recruited men from Trieste {{and elsewhere in the}} Habsburg lands, and Pope Paul III sent soldiers from Ancona. There were about 3,000 infantry in the reinforcements, which made a sizeable relief force, that were commanded by Petar Kružić, Niccolo dalla Torre, and a papal commissioner Jacomo Dalmoro d'Arbe. On March 9, 1537, they disembarked near Klis, at a place called S. Girolamo, with fourteen pieces of artillery. After Ibrahim's death, Suleiman the Magnificent sent 8,000 men under the command of Murat-beg Tardić (Amurat Vaivoda), a Croatian renegade who had been born in Šibenik, to go and lay siege to Klis fortress (Clissa), and fight against Petar Kružić. An initial encounter of the Christian relief force with the Turks was indecisive, but, on March 12, they were overwhelmed by the arrival of a great number of Turks.|$|E

25|$|Scholars such as Ulrich Luz and {{separately}} Dale Allison {{view the}} pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians. Alan Robinson sees the pericope {{as important in}} establishing {{the belief in the}} early Church that the disciples viewed Jesus as the Son of God. Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that God the Father is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> divine power with his son and that the impact of this pericope on the affirmation of the divinity of Jesus in the ecumenical creeds is undeniable.|$|E
25|$|The oligarchies {{opposed the}} Cleomenian reforms. With Cleomenes' quick {{victories}} this opposition increased throughout all the Peloponnese. Cleomenes took Corinth and other strategic places. The Cleomenian reforms, {{although they were}} {{not intended to be}} applied to the defeated populations, was a significant factor behind the campaign successes of the Spartan king. Indeed, some of the Achean population wanted to be debt-free and were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> their lands for more equity. In reality, Cleomenes did not care that much about the defeated population and chose to negotiate with the oligarchies even if the enmity between Aratus and Cleomenes was too great to enable them to come to an agreement.|$|E

25|$|Women {{have been}} found to find altruistic men to be {{attractive}} partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts {{in the early stages of}} a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall {{to give up her}} work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the {{supervisors}} of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.|$|E

25|$|Company policy {{required}} land to {{be purchased}} from the indigenous peoples. The WIC would offer a land patent, {{the recipient of}} which would be responsible for negotiating a deal with representatives of the local population, usually the sachem or high chief. The Dutch (referred to by the natives as Swannekins, or salt water people) and the Wilden (as the Dutch called the natives) had vastly different conceptions of ownership and use of land—so much so that they did not understand each other at all. The Dutch thought that their proffer of gifts in the form of sewant or manufactured goods was a trade agreement and defense alliance, which gave them exclusive rights to farming, hunting, and fishing. Often, the Indians did not vacate the property, or reappeared seasonally, according to their migration patterns. They were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the land with the Europeans, but the Indians did not intend to leave or give up access. This misunderstanding and other differences led to violent conflict later. At the same time, such differences marked the beginnings of a multicultural society.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} Federal soldiers, {{the voyage}} to Hatteras Inlet was {{the worst part of}} the battle. Earning its reputation, the weather in the {{vicinity}} of Cape Hatteras turned foul, causing many of them to become seasick. In an act of bravado, Burnside left his comfortable quarters aboard the transport George Peabody and with his staff went aboard Army gunboat Picket. He chose this vessel because he considered her to be the least seaworthy ship in his command, and by showing his troops that he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> their misery, he earned their devotion. When the storm struck, he began to doubt the wisdom of his move, but Picket survived and got him safely to his destination. Three vessels in the armada were not so lucky: City of New York, laden with ordnance and supplies; Pocahontas, carrying horses; and Army gunboat Zouave were all lost, although all persons aboard were rescued. The only personnel losses were two officers of the 9th New Jersey, who were drowned when their surfboat overturned following a visit to the flagship.|$|E

She is called a [...] "coward" [...] by Scully, who finds her weak for having accepted the deal. Although Reyes' betrayal comes at a great loss to Scully, it is the knowledge gained as a result of working for the Smoking Man that allows for the development and administration of a vaccine to Fox Mulder, Agents Miller and Einstein—and, presumably—the rest of humanity thereafter.|$|E
