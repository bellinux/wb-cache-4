Being asked about the supposed split, Ashcroft told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I can confirm <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> we set out to do [...] Right now there are no plans to be doing anything in the near future." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 13, 2010, Glover {{compared}} {{the scale and}} devastation of the 2010 Haiti earthquake to the predicament other island nations may face {{as a result of}} the failed Copenhagen summit the previous year. Glover said: [...] "...the threat of what happens to Haiti is a threat that can happen anywhere in the Caribbean to these island nations... they're all in peril because of global warming... because of climate change... when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> we did at the climate summit in Copenhagen, this is the response, this is what happens..." [...] In the same statement, he called for a new form of international partnership with Haiti and other Caribbean nations and praised Venezuela, Brazil, and Cuba, for already accepting this partnership.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the record}} a more {{developed}} and mature set of songs, [...] "Subject to Change" [...] also {{proved to be}} The Faith's swan song, as the group disbanded {{by the summer of}} 1983. Drummer Ivor Hanson announced he would soon leave for college. Finding a replacement was not an option. According to guitarist Mike Hampton, the rest of the band was having trouble getting along. [...] "It was a good time to stop, but I suppose it’s a shame that we flamed out before getting a solid tour set up and executed, but it’s also a wonder and a success that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>what</b> we did." [...] Alec declared that it was getting more difficult to be productive and creative together, although the end was also a beginning. After The Faith broke up, guitarist Eddie Janney formed Rites of Spring with Guy Picciotto; while Hampton, Bald, and Hanson went on to join Embrace with Ian MacKaye on vocals. When Embrace broke up in early 1986, Chris Bald rejoined Alec MacKaye in Ignition (with Alec on vocals;) meanwhile, Janney reunited with Michael Hampton for One Last Wish following Rites of Spring's breakup (later reformed as Happy Go Licky.) Finally, Hampton and Hanson reunited in Manifesto in 1991, while Alec MacKaye sang with The Warmers during the mid-'90s.|$|E
