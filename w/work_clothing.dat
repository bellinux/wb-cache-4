25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Cowboy boots, {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} riding boot, {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|E

25|$|Protective {{clothing}} {{includes a}} hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants tucked into socks or boots. Light-colored clothing makes the tick more easily visible before it attaches itself. People should use special care in handling and allowing outdoor pets inside homes {{because they can}} bring ticks into the house. People who work in areas with woods, bushes, leaf litter, and tall grass {{are at risk of}} becoming infected with Lyme at work. Employers can reduce the risk for employees by providing education on Lyme transmission and infection risks, and about how to check themselves for ticks on the groin, armpits, and hair. <b>Work</b> <b>clothing</b> used in risky areas should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer to kill any ticks.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 {{agreement}} was the richest contract in UMWA history. Miners received a 54 percent wage-and-benefit increase over three years. A cost-of-living clause, {{the first in}} the union's history, was also included. Vacation days rose from 20 to 30 days a year, and five days of [...] "personal leave" [...] also established. Employers agreed to pay for training safety committee members, quarterly mine-safety inspections conducted by UMWA, <b>work</b> <b>clothing</b> and safety equipment such as goggles. The {{agreement was}} ratified by 56 percent of the membership, which was a relatively narrow vote. Retired miners were particularly unhappy that their benefits were now lower than those offered to younger miners.|$|E
