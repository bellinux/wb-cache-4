Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments {{about her and}} requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him {{and that he should}} be free to pass them on to <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E

25|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>he</b> was, Abu Muslim built {{a secret}} network of pro-Abbasid {{sentiment}} based among the mixed Arab and Iranian military officers along the Silk Road garrison cities. Through this networking, Abu Muslim ensured armed {{support for the}} Abbasids from a multi-ethnic force years before the revolution even {{came out in the}} open. These networks proved essential, as the officers garrisoned along the Silk Road had spent years fighting the ferocious Turkic tribes of Central Asia and were experienced and respected tacticians and warriors.|$|E
25|$|In June 1987, Lyon {{was bought}} by Rhône {{businessman}} Jean-Michel Aulas who {{took control of the}} club aiming to turn Lyon into an established Ligue 1 side. His ambitious plan, titled OL – Europe, was designed to develop the club at the European level and back into the first division within a period of no more than four years. The first manager under the new hierarchy was Raymond Domenech. The aspiring chairman gave Domenech carte blanche to recruit <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> saw fit to help the team reach the first division. They went on to accomplish this in Domenech's first season in charge. Lyon achieved its zenith under Domenech when it qualified for the UEFA Cup. For the remainder of his tenure, however, the club underachieved. Domenech was replaced by former French international Jean Tigana, who led the team to an impressive second place in the 1994–95 season.|$|E
25|$|However, if the tsar’s {{policies}} were too extreme or too disliked, {{he was not}} considered the true tsar. In these cases, {{it was necessary to}} replace this “fake” tsar with the “true” tsar, <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees. However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church. Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.|$|E

25|$|In {{the present}} day, the player is {{contacted}} by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that their employers {{know more than}} they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He convinces the player to hack several Animus terminals and security cameras, and then has them deliver the information taken to Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, who are working undercover to infiltrate Abstergo. When the facility is locked down after the hackings are discovered, John arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materializes into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although {{it was necessary to}} open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so, thus implicating him as the one responsible for the hacks. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends. With the Sage dead, the player is contacted by the Assassins as they continue their infiltration of Abstergo, but neither side is able to explain the Sage's presence or identify his followers, the Instruments of the First Will.|$|E
500|$|Curtis's {{subsequent}} actions {{increased the}} distrust felt by his fellow officers. While Curtis {{was granted a}} baronetcy {{for his role in}} the action, another captain, Anthony Molloy, faced a court martial and national disgrace for what was considered to be his failure to engage the enemy during the battle. Curtis stood as prosecutor in the case, and Molloy was subsequently dismissed from his ship and effectively from the service as the result of Curtis's prosecution. Cuthbert Collingwood, one of the captains overlooked by the despatch, subsequently described Curtis as [...] "an artful, sneeking creature, whose fawning insinuating manners creeps into the confidence of <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> attacks and whose rapacity wou'd grasp all honours and all profits that come within his view".|$|E

He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: Terry-Thomas in Tuscany, Terry-Thomas in the South of France and Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland. He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that [...] "for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand, everybody was always out to do the producer of any film <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> was.

500|$|Polish {{astronomer}} Johannes Hevelius {{formed the}} constellation in 1687 from 19 faint stars between the constellations Ursa Major and Auriga that earlier {{had been part}} of the obsolete constellation Jordanus Fluvius. Naming it Lynx because of its faintness, he challenged future stargazers to see it, declaring that only the lynx-eyed (those with good sight) would have been able to recognize it. Hevelius used the name Tigris (Tiger) in his catalogue as well, but kept the former name only in his atlas. English astronomer John Flamsteed adopted the constellation in his catalogue, published in 1712, and his subsequent atlas. According to 19th-century amateur astronomer Richard Hinckley Allen, the chief stars in Lynx [...] "might well have been utilized by the modern constructor, <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> was, of our Ursa Major to complete the quartette of feet." ...|$|E
500|$|Recognition came late to Delius; before 1899, when he {{was already}} 37, his works were largely {{unpublished}} and unknown to the public. When the symphonic poem Paa Vidderne was performed at Monte Carlo on 25 February 1894 in a programme of works from British composers, The Musical Times listed the composers as [...] "...Balfe, Mackenzie, Oakeley, Sullivan... and one Delius, <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> may be". The work was well received in Monte Carlo, and brought the composer a congratulatory letter from Princess Alice of Monaco, but this {{did not lead to}} demands for further performances of this or other Delius works. Some of his individual songs (he wrote more than 60) were occasionally included in vocal recitals; referring to [...] "the strange songs of Fritz Delius", The Times critic expressed regret [...] "that the powers the composer undoubtedly possesses should not be turned to better account or undergo proper development at the hands of some musician competent to train them".|$|E
500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then when I left him, he called <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> thought was necessary to keep {{me out of the}} NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack in}} 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978.

500|$|Since {{the end of}} this {{so-called}} golden age of piracy, Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides. [...] Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, published in Britain in 1724. [...] A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as Anne Bonny and Mary Read were for years required reading for those interested in the subject. [...] Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entry on Blackbeard was [...] "coloured a little to make a more sensational story." [...] A General Historie, though, is generally considered to be a reliable source. [...] Johnson may have been an assumed alias. [...] As Johnson's accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches, Lee (1974) considers that <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> was, he had some access to official correspondence. [...] Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright Charles Johnson, the British publisher Charles Rivington, or the writer Daniel Defoe. [...] In his 1951 work The Great Days of Piracy, author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is [...] "obviously a pseudonym", continuing [...] "one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself." ...|$|E

Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like symbiotic entity known as [...] to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history so one among them can manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he created the entity's host body , who like his assumed clone brothers was actually a human who mutated as a result of being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya's Infinite Tsukuyomi ages ago. Though he and White Zetsu are effective in their symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location or separate himself from the part of his body holding Black Zetsu and uses spores to create clones of himself or <b>whoever</b> <b>he</b> touches. This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those that the organization does not want found. Another of the White Zetsu that Black Zetsu brought out of the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as [...] due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, is later named [...] and served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth was getting used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu went into hiding until it later merges itself onto Obito to force the human into resurrecting Madara. But ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan ran its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit. Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha while helping Kaguya deal with Naruto and Sasuke, eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severed Kaguya's arm. Seeing Kaguya being sealed away again, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator. Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style before ejecting him once Madara succeeds in casting the Infinite Tsukiyomi, is last seen crumbling after the jutsu is canceled with his former captive the only witness to his death.|$|E
