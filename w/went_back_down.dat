25|$|Ross {{was known}} as a smart fighter with great stamina. He {{retained}} his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933 and against Peter Nebo to begin 1934. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus Jimmy McLarnin. Ross vacated the light welterweight title to go after McLarnin's welterweight title and won by a 15-round decision, his third world championship. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision and recovered the title. After that, Ross <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to light welterweight and reclaimed his title with a 12-round decision over Bobby Pacho. After beating Klick and Henry Woods by decision to retain that title, he went back up in weight for his third and last fight with McLarnin; he recovered the welterweight title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, over that stretch were against Garcia and against Izzy Jannazzo, on points in 15 rounds.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. [...] He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. [...] Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. [...] He removed the bar {{and used it to}} break through the ceiling into the [...] "Red Room" [...] above the [...] "Castle", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic Jacobite prisoners after the Battle of Preston. [...] Still wearing his leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60feet (20m) above the ground. [...] He <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>down</b> to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. [...] He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. [...] Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in Tottenham (near modern Tottenham Court Road). [...] Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from Bridewell Prison, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. [...] His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 shillings to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. [...] His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. [...] This escape astonished everyone. Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account for John Applebee, The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard. [...] In his History, Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.|$|E

60|$|Now Gizur's folk, {{seeing what}} had come about, took heart and fell upon Eric with a rush, {{and those who}} were with the dead thrall rushed at Skallagrim, and there began such a fight as has not been known in Iceland.

And so fierce and true were the blows of Eric and Skallagrim that of those who came on few <b>went</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Down</b> they fell, and where they fell they died, and for every man who died Eric and Skallagrim won a pace towards the point of rock. Whitefire flamed so swift and swept so wide that it seemed to Swanhild, watching, as though three swords were aloft at once, and the axe of Skallagrim thundered down like the axe of a woodman against a tree, and those groaned on whom it fell as groans a falling tree. Now the shields of these twain were hewn through and through, and cast away, and their blood ran from many wounds. Still, their life was whole in them and they plied axe and sword with both hands.

A little further on I caught sight of yet another human being, a tall gaunt old woman in cap and shawl, who came out of a cottage and moved feebly towards a pile of faggots a few yards from the door. Just as she got to the pile I passed, and she slowly turned and gazed at me out of her dim old eyes. Her wrinkled face was the colour of ashes and was like the face of a corpse, still bearing on it the marks of suffering endured for many miserable years. And these three were the only inhabitants I saw on my way down the street.|$|E
