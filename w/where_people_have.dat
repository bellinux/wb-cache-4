5|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} under poverty line was 60.5 per cent in 2010 compared to 62.8 per cent in 2006 as per the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS). The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent {{of the total population}} as against 42.7 per cent in 2007. Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. Albinism is a condition <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 albino people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of albino population was 66.1 per cent.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{people living}} {{close to the}} equator are highly darkly pigmented, and those living near the poles are {{generally}} very lightly pigmented.

25|$|Insomnia, {{also known}} as sleeplessness, is a sleep {{disorder}} <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> trouble sleeping.

He had apparently passed directly over the crocodile in the water. However, in general, it is still considered safe to swim with this species, so long as they are not aggravated.|$|E

25|$|Zygomycosis is the {{broadest}} term {{to refer to}} infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota {{has been identified as}} polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.|$|E

25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{have been}} {{an important aspect of}} urban culture since 1910. The places <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> watched films, from the nickelodeon to the multiplex, have changed in ways that reflect changes in the society generally. The cinema in Edmonton reflected the changing urban landscape. Because the movie houses themselves are part of the entertainment product, the cinema industry follows a cycle of construction, renovation, and demolition. The industry's face is constantly changing in an effort to draw people inside; Edmonton's cinemas have moved with the retail industry from the downtown core to the suburban shopping malls, and are now experimenting with new formats similar to retailers' big boxes. Just as Edmonton is known for massive amounts of retail space, it also {{has one of the highest}} numbers of movie screens in Canada in proportion to its population. Cinemas are thus a revealing aspect of trends in urban development.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} of waterway transformation {{is found in}} Igarapé Guariba in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close {{to the town of}} Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3km) long across fields thick with tall papyrus grass and into dense tropical rain forest. The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape {{in this part of the}} northern Brazilian state of Amapá was dramatically transformed.|$|E

500|$|A diaphonemic {{inventory}} is {{a specific}} diasystem (a term popularized by Uriel Weinreich) that superimposes dialectal contrasts to access all contrasts in all dialects that are included.

The diaphonemic approach gets away from the assumption that linguistic communities are homogeneous, allows multiple varieties to be described in the same terms (something important for situations <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> abilities {{in more than one}} variety), and helps in ascertaining where speakers make diaphonic identifications as a result of similarities and differences between the varieties involved.|$|E
