5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she <b>will</b> <b>back</b> Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney <b>will</b> <b>back</b> him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E

Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice. To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop.

Previously; Robin Walker MP (Worcester) and Sir Peter Luff (former MP for Mid Worcestershire), along with Adrian Hardman (former leader of Worcestershire County Council) have spoken out against a future 'Birmingham and The Black Country' combined authority incorporating the county. Councillor Hardman also said that empowering the city regions is essential to any new English devolution settlement, but the great counties of England have an equal role in ensuring the economic success of the UK. Councillor Simon Geraghty (current leader of Worcestershire County Council) also stated that the county has no plans to join the combined authority, but previously refused to rule out a change of consensus, if it is felt that Worcestershire is getting left behind.|$|E

Terri tells Will {{to get out of the}} car and they get into an argument, which causes Emma to leave the scene. The words simmer down and Terri advises Will to return the car to the dealership, because he cannot afford it. Before leaving, she says that Emma will break Will's heart again and he'll return to her eventually. In [...] "The Substitute", Terri returns to take care of a sick Will. They have sex, but the next day when she sees Will's substitute, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) at his apartment having a beer with him, she becomes suspicious and makes several snarky comments to Holly. Even after Terri apologizes, Will tells her it is over. A heartbroken Terri promises Will he will regret it, and she storms out of the door.

500|$|Following {{the death}} of their grandson, Les and Pam confess their {{blackmail}} secret to their friend, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who warns Babe to end the blackmail. However, despite Claudette's warnings, Babe continues to blackmail the Cokers. This sparks tension between Babe and Claudette, who tells Babe that she will be moving back to the square to keep a [...] "closer eye" [...] on her. Badland explained Babe's rivalry with Claudette: [...] "Claudette's sticking up for Les and Pam. She's a fair match for Babe and it's interesting when they go head-to-head." [...] Badland hoped that the feud would last a long time, opining that it was [...] "fabulous", and that [...] "neither [...] <b>will</b> <b>back</b> down easily", and adding that she thought Babe would triumph over Claudette, though admitted she was biased and probably [...] "the only person on Babe's side". An Inside Soap reporter said Babe and Claudette's feud was [...] "exciting" [...] because Claudette is [...] "fearsome" [...] and Babe is [...] "equally terrifying", and suspected that [...] "Cunning Babe [...] be so easily intimidated". A reporter for All About Soap questioned if Babe had [...] "finally met her match" [...] in Claudette, and compared the two women. In terms of cunning, they said that Babe has it [...] "by the bucketload", while Claudette may be [...] "getting soft in her old age" [...] and may not be [...] "sharp enough to take on Babe". They also opined that Claudette had more [...] "fighting strenth" [...] as she continues to come back after a [...] "knock down" [...] and would not go down without a fight, while Babe's craftiness [...] "means she'd easily {{come up with a new}} way to destroy an enemy". They said that Claudette has a [...] "nasty and murderous" [...] history while Babe's past is [...] "chequered" [...] but she had never killed someone, concluding that Claudette would be the winner of the feud, but still saying that they [...] "wouldn't mess with Babe!".|$|E

500|$|Monday 10 May {{saw another}} day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to {{continue}} negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but {{that one of the}} barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5.00pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to [...] "sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election." [...] The statement went on to say, [...] "I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post {{by the time of the}} Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I <b>will</b> <b>back</b> no individual candidate." [...] He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but many in the Party felt that a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, [...] "I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic–the numbers don't add up." [...] However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated in the talks – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. [...] " [...] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences".|$|E

Moreover, Dulles did not share any sentimental regard for the Anglo-American [...] "special relationship", which led the Americans to lean towards the Egyptian side in the Anglo-Egyptian disputes. During the extremely difficult negotiations over the British evacuation of the Suez Canal base in 1954–55, the Americans generally supported Egypt, though at the same time trying hard to limit the extent of the damage that this might cause to Anglo-American relations.|$|E

[...] We see the Falklands as British territory and the Falklands Islanders as subjects of our Queen.

On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (“Madame Blavatsky”, “They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh”). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In [...] "Canoe", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across {{the head with a}} paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it).
