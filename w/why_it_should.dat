In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.|$|E
25|$|When {{the scope}} of the physics is widened to include gravity, the {{interpretation}} of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling explanation as to <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should.</b>|$|E

25|$|If a river, {{subject to}} tides, {{constituted}} {{the boundary of}} a State, and at flood {{the waters of the}} river flowed through a narrow channel, round an extensive body of land, but receded from that channel at ebb, so as to leave the land it surrounded at high water, connected with {{the main body of the}} country; this portion of territory would scarcely be considered as belonging to the State on the opposite side of the river, although that State should have the property of the river. The principle that a country bounded by a river extends to low water mark, a principle so natural, and of such obvious convenience as to have been generally adopted, would, we think, apply to that case. We perceive no sufficient reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not apply to this.|$|E

500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to see <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war Guthrie had striven to {{keep the}} Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base, and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made two stipulations: first, as he was unwilling to seek his own release from the forces, the {{governing}} board of the Old Vic should explain to the authorities <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be granted; secondly, that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, [...] "It would be a disaster, {{you would have to}} spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." [...] It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, [...] "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful." ...|$|E
500|$|Regular night-time {{meetings}} were held across the region, headed by speakers {{from a range}} of professions. Harford suggests that the organisers' choice of orators represents their [...] "canny ability" [...] to choose speakers who might move their audiences to support their cause. By adopting techniques used by the Anti-Corn Law League, their strategy was ultimately successful: local offices were acquired, secretaries hired and further meetings organised. The weekly Ship Canal Gazette, priced at one penny, was {{by the end of the}} year being sold at newsagents in towns across Lancashire. [...] The Gazette was part of a prolonged print campaign organised by the committee, to circulate leaflets and pamphlets, and write supportive letters to the local press, often signed with pseudonyms. [...] One of the few surviving leaflets, [...] "The Manchester Ship Canal. Reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>Should</b> be Made", argued against dock and railway rates, which were apparently levied [...] "with the object of protecting the interests of Railway kings, [...] trade is handicapped, and wages kept low". [...] By the end of 1882 the provisional committee comprised members from several of Manchester's large industries, but notably few of the city's wealthier inhabitants. The sympathetic Manchester City News reported that [...] "the rich men of South and East Lancashire, with a few notable exceptions, have not rivalled the enthusiasm of the general public".|$|E

[...] There were, in fact, five successors, described by Pepys-Whiteley as [...] "a series of uninterrupted successes throughout eight years, in which both partners had star parts." [...] These shows played in the West End and on tour in the UK, and in 1925 the Hulberts made their Broadway debut in their current revue, By-the-Way. The New York Times found the show [...] "beguiling". The fourth in the series, Clowns in Clover, contained one of Courtneidge's most celebrated sketches, [...] "Double Damask", by Dion Titheradge, in which her character, Mrs. Spooner, and two shop assistants become entangled in tongue-twisters. When Courtneidge's 1932 recording of the sketch was reissued in 1972, The Gramophone said, [...] "it is an enduring classic comedy sketch as funny now as it was then".|$|E

The essay was {{based in part on}} his experience in developing Fetchmail. He first presented his thesis at the annual Linux Kongress on May 27, 1997. He later expanded the essay into a book, The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary, in 1999. The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the Mozilla (then Netscape) source code in 1998 cited The Cathedral and the Bazaar as [...] "independent validation" [...] of ideas proposed by Eric Hahn and Jamie Zawinski. Hahn would later describe the 1999 book as [...] "clearly influential".|$|E
2500|$|This {{ceiling was}} done {{at the time the}} new Chapel was built. It would not have been {{possible}} to remove a wood and plaster ceiling entire, or even in pieces, and re-erect it, and there would have been no need for an expensive model if the old vaulting had been in the College, ready to put up again. Also, the entry of 18 June 1659, [...] "began to plaster the Chapel roof" [...] which, doubtless, refers to the panels of plaster between the wood ribs. It may be objected that this is very late for a fan-vaulted roof, and so it would be anywhere but in Oxford. The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640.
