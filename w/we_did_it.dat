25|$|However, later Pakistani {{officials}} {{have claimed that}} the strike was actually conducted by the U.S. {{and that they have}} also requested the U.S. not to violate their sovereignty again. “We thought it would be less damaging if we said <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> rather than the US,” said a key aide to President Pervez Musharraf. Local people claimed the victims included boys as young as 12 but Pakistani officials insisted they had been shown satellite images of people training and had checked the identity cards of all those killed, and that all were adults.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
