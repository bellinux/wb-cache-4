2500|$|In languages, {{modality}} {{deals with}} the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, [...] "We go to the games" [...] can be modified to give [...] "We {{should go to the}} games", and [...] "We can go to the games" [...] and perhaps [...] "We will go to the games". More abstractly, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the modal fallacy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the other}} {{definition}} a function {{is defined as}} a set of ordered pairs where each first element only occurs once. The domain is the set of all the first elements of a pair and there is no explicit codomain separate from the image. [...] Concepts like surjective have to be refined for such functions, more specifically by saying that a (given) function is surjective on a (given) set if its image equals that set. [...] For example, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> a function f is surjective on the set of real numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{margin of}} error has been {{described}} [...] as an [...] "absolute" [...] quantity, equal to a confidence interval radius for the statistic. For example, if the true value is 50 percentage points, and the statistic has a confidence interval radius of 5 percentage points, then we say the {{margin of error}} is 5 percentage points. As another example, if the true value is 50 people, and the statistic has a confidence interval radius of 5 people, then <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{the margin of error}} is 5 people.|$|E

2500|$|Flexible accumulation, {{consumer}} culture, and the [...] "new world information order" [...] {{are produced}} or distributed (made to flow) globally, {{to occupy the}} space of the nation, but are no longer [...] "motivated" [...] by any essential connections to a state, as embodied, for example, in a [...] "national-popular" [...] formation. Their motivations are both infra- and supranational. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that, from the purview of the national proscenium, a posthegemonic situation holds. That is, the [...] "compromise solution" [...] that culture provided for Gramsci is not now one that pertains to the national level but to the local and transnational. Instead, the [...] "culture-ideology of consumerism" [...] serves to naturalize global capitalism everywhere.|$|E
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{original}} Sublime Society in 1867, three separate efforts have been made to revive it in various forms. Sir Henry Irving, as proprietor of the Lyceum Theatre, had possession within his theatre of the society's last premises. [...] From about 1878 until his death in 1905, he hosted dinners in the society's dining room. [...] A biographer of Irving wrote, [...] "He wanted the Lyceum to have the same educational and intellectual force that Phelps' theatre had enjoyed in lslington." [...] A contemporary newspaper reported, [...] "Almost as soon as Mr. Irving undertook the management of the Lyceum he restored this venerable sanctuary to something like its former appearance, and very often now it is the scene of the informal and bright little supper parties which he delights to bring about him. … If the nocturnal gatherings in the room were not of a private character <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> a good deal about them, especially as the guests frequently include men whose names are great." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a Cabinet {{meeting on}} 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that [...] "at {{the present time}} Germany was {{building}} ships {{as fast as she}} could but that she {{would not be able to}} exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E
2500|$|Second is a {{rejection}} of the modernist [...] "Utopian gesture", evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a [...] "fundamental mutation" [...] so that it has [...] "now become a set of texts or simulacra" [...] (Jameson 1993:38). Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (<b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a [...] "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer {{in a way that would}} seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content" [...] (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and Enlightenment rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.|$|E
