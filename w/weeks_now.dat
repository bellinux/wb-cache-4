5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{was drawn}} to this story because {{he spent much of}} his {{childhood}} in San Anselmo in Marin County during the initial Zodiac murders. [...] "I remember coming home and saying the highway patrol had been following our school buses for a couple <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> [...] And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, turned slowly in his chair and said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E
500|$|The Edgeworths jointly {{developed}} {{the concept of}} [...] "Practical Education", a principle that would become a new paradigm by the 1820s. Having determined that after eight years, Richard Edgeworth's attempt to raise his eldest son Richard according {{to the principles of}} Rousseau was a failure, he and Honora were determined to find better methods. After the birth of Honora's first child (1774), the Edgeworths embarked on a plan, partly inspired by Anna Barbauld, to write a series of books for children. After trying many other methods, Barbauld's Lessons for Children from two to three years old was published in 1778, and the Edgeworths used it on Anna (5) and Honora (4), and were delighted to find that the girls learned to read in six <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> back in England, at Northchurch the Edgeworths were in closer contact with the intellectuals of the Lunar society. Richard Edgeworth and Honora were determined to design a plan for the education of their children. They started by reviewing the existing literature on childhood education (including Locke, Hartley, Priestley in addition to Rousseau), and then proceeded to document their observations of the behaviour of children and then {{developed the}}ir own [...] "practical" [...] system. To this end Erasmus Darwin suggested they start by reading the work of Dugald Stewart. Honora Sneyd then started recording extensive notes on her observations of the Edgeworth children. These then became the dialogues in the final book.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the disappointing results, Israel {{received}} something of a consolation prize, as the country swept the Eurovision-sanctioned 2010 Marcel Bezençon Awards, winning for best artist, best composition, and best entry of the contest. It {{is the first time}} in the history of the awards, which are selected by the contest's accredited media and press, participating composers, and commentators that a single country has won more than one award in the same year.

After all, it’s just sports.” While Christer Björkman, a founder of the Marcel Bezençon Awards, stated, [...] "The awards given to the Israeli entry show a virtue of the prize. It reveals something that didn't come across in the vote of the contest....
