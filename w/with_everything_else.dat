25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E

According to strict guild regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was {{the business of the}} menuisier alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (huissier), both of whom specialized in seat-furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable bergère ("shepherdess") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes rechampi en blanc) or left in the natural color (á la capuchine), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded boiseries for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Liège all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This is a Grade II listed building. St John's in Windle Royd Lane, Warley, Halifax, was {{designed}} by Barber and built between 1877 and 1878. This was a replacement for a wooden church built in 1856 in Windle Royd Lane further uphill. It {{was designed}} in Gothic Revival style for a congregation of 320–342, built {{at a cost of}} £3,930–4,000 with a church grant of £240 and consecrated in 1878. The building was planned as a nave and chancel, <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> to the south: the nave aisle, tower, vestry and organ chamber. It is built of locally quarried sandstone with grey freestone dressings. The tower, notable for its large pinnacles, is attached to the north-west corner of the nave, with a square turret housing a spiral tower staircase to the bell-ringers' chamber only, this turret being tucked between the spire and the nave. The tower's ground floor is the church entrance, and the clock mechanism and clock faces between the ringers' chamber and the belfry were added in 1905. The chancel has an open wagon roof and the nave has closely spaced rafters. Due to the 2005 interior re-ordering, there is little left of Barber's designed and commissioned furnishings, but his floors may still exist, concealed beneath carpeting. There is an octagonal font and a round stone pulpit with [...] "open arcading and fleurons" [...] which may possibly be to his original 1877 design. The reason for listing is given as the exterior architecture by Barber as a local architect, and the church's position in the landscape.|$|E

2500|$|A {{conglomeration}} of disused, condemned buildings clustered {{together to}} form a self-contained habitat, Limitless Fortress is subdivided into three specific tiers – Lower Town, the Beltline and Babylon City. Lower Town is the lowest in altitude, with several layers extending below ground level. The Beltline, the most dangerous area of The Limitless Fortress, is ruled by Der Kaiser, Ban's father. Babylon City, the upper most level of the Limitless Fortress, is said to be where the Brain Trust resides, and is the home of Ginji's mother. In actuality, Babylon City is what one might consider the real world, <b>with</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> being a virtual reality creation. Only those who have won the Ogre Battle may enter Babylon City and when that happens, they can change the world as they see fit. Both Ban and Ginji go to the Fortress with Ban wishing to rescue a kidnapped Himiko from Kagami, and Ginji finding a possibility to meet his mother. Going to the Beltline, the GetBackers encounter various warriors taking orders from a being known as Voodoo King from Babylon City. The Voodoo King seeks to obtain three [...] "keys" [...] which will help him unlock the gates from Babylon City sealed by Ban's grandmother several years ago. After finding the three keys: Shido's chimera spirit, Himiko's mirror and the GetBackers, the Voodoo King is faced by Ginji, Thunder Emperor alter-ego attacks him in a clash which destroys the Voodoo King and making Raitei disappear forever as he existed to balance the scales. With Voodoo King gone, Raitei's purpose was fulfilled and he disappeared forever. Following this, both Ban and Ginji face each other in Ogre Battle with Ban giving up, impressed with Ginji's will. Ginji goes to Babylon City where he meets his mother from a parallel universe, who explains how she created the Fortress and its surrounding [...] world. Following a discussion between the two of them, the Fortress' world remains unchanged except that the virtual people living become real beings. Ban and Ginji continue their retrieval job, ending the series when requested to go on a mission that will lead them to meet Ban's mother.|$|E
