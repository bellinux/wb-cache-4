5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins <b>within</b> <b>themselves.</b> The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|A {{year has}} past since the {{encounter}} with Beerus. Goku and Vegeta had been training under Whis who had taken them as his students to master on controlling their flow of energy, maintaining it from <b>within</b> <b>themselves.</b> During this time, the remaining remnant of Frieza's army had went to earth to use the dragon balls to revive the long dead galactic ruler. Being revived and regenerated from the army's latest technology of regeneration, Frieza had began to plot his revenge on Goku who had defeated him on planet Namek. Learning that he had defeated Majin Buu, one of two beings warned not to fight with from his father; the other being Beerus, Frieza decided to begin intense training to reach new heights of power to face Goku. Frieza's army had arrived on Earth while Goku and Vegeta still training with Whis. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi had fought the remnant until their return. Once arriving on Earth, Frieza and Goku had fought showing their latest forms and power. Goku achieved a form beyond the Super Saiyan God form being the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Sayian Blue). Frieza revealed his new form achieved after training stating he has not done before, calling it his Golden form.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins as}} an {{initiate}} {{of a powerful}} sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence <b>within</b> <b>themselves.</b> Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player's character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like Shaper Creation. During the journey, the Shaper passes a group of islands, {{one of which is}} recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or something very valuable is located there. As the Shaper examines Sucia, lost in thought, the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the Shaper on an abandoned dockside before dying. The player is now stranded on Sucia Island and {{must find a way to}} leave.|$|E

25|$|The boatmen (usually {{with their}} families) were a rough {{independent}} lot, forming a class <b>within</b> <b>themselves,</b> and intermarrying {{within their own}} group.

They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia, as they knew it, is no more, as 1,300 years have passed and their castle is in ruins, while all Narnians have retreated so far <b>within</b> <b>themselves</b> that only Aslan's magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.|$|E

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic <b>within</b> <b>themselves.</b> But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

500|$|... “The Princess and the Pea” spurred on {{positive}} criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard {{pointed out}} the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that [...] "the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil, and man's follies—is reflected in his tales," [...] and most evidently in [...] "The Princess and the Pea." [...] Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering, and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes, and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized {{that one of the}} things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess.

500|$|Many {{commentators}} have remarked {{on a number}} of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. The Lord of the Rings is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World WarII. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory. This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay [...] "On Fairy-Stories", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both <b>within</b> <b>themselves</b> and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien objected strongly to C.S.Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical. However, Tolkien wrote that the Mount Doom scene exemplified lines from the Lord's Prayer.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} Shin-shiro, {{the band}} had {{many opportunities to}} meet other bands that performed similar music to them, because they were now based in Tokyo. In particular, Yamaguchi felt influenced by Yūsuke Koide of Base Ball Bear, impressed that Koide's lyrics managed to express himself as himself, despite their fictional nature. Yamaguchi wrote his first fiction song because of this, [...] "Omotesandō Nijūroku-ji", as a challenge for himself, and to match the mixing theme of Kikuuiki. Yamaguchi took further inspiration from the Shōwa period in Japan during its asset price bubble when writing [...] "Omotesandō Nijūroku-ji". The song [...] "Ushio" [...] {{was one of the}} first compositions written for the album. Yamaguchi decided to place it as the first song on the album, as he felt it was similar to the material found on Shin-shiro, as a way to show off what sort of band Sakanaction were up until the release of [...] "Aruku Around". The song mixed a heavy lyrical theme of whether personal philosophies arise from a person's community or from <b>within</b> <b>themselves,</b> with a psychedelic, avant garde pop sound.|$|E

Cena made his WWE television debut on the June 27, 2002 episode of SmackDown! by answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle. After declaring that he possessed [...] "ruthless aggression", Cena lost by a pinning combination. After the match, Cena was congratulated by Billy Kidman, Faarooq, Rikishi, and The Undertaker. Following the near-win, Cena became a fan favorite and started feuding with Chris Jericho, defeating Jericho at Vengeance. Then, Cena feuded with Los Guerreros (Chavo and Eddie Guerrero) and Cena picked up a victory over Chavo Guerrero on the September 3, 2002 taping of Velocity. On the September 12 episode of SmackDown!, Cena teamed with Edge in a losing effort against Los Guerreros, thus ending the feud in the process. Cena went on to defeat the likes of Albert and D-Von Dudley as he was restricted to appearances on Velocity for the rest of September.|$|E

Due to Captain America: The Winter Soldier revealing that Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. with sleeper agents, the season sees a retooling for the final six episodes. Regarding the synergy the show has with addressing events from the films, Loeb said [...] "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business". The characters face the Hydra issue head on, while experiencing trust issues <b>within</b> <b>themselves.</b> Jed Whedon added that the Hydra element, which the show could not mention until after the release of The Winter Soldier in order to avoid spoiling the film, also attempts to address the lack of characters from the comics, a complaint fans had throughout the season, while also tying established threats such as the Clairvoyant, Project Centipede, and Deathlok, back into Hydra.|$|E
500|$|The {{selection}} of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, {{a member of}} the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel War and Peace, was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read {{with the advent of the}} Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that War and Peace was [...] "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that [...] "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects". Shirky's comments on War and Peace were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books [...] "were created to serve a purpose", that [...] "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be [...] "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, [...] "had charms of their own". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that [...] "the book is the apex of human culture" [...] should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed <b>within</b> <b>themselves</b> and enters [...] "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" [...] in which he feels psychologically fragmented.|$|E
500|$|Clarence13X {{developed}} novel teachings, assigning backronyms to familiar words. He {{stated that}} {{the letters of the}} word [...] "Allah" [...] stood for [...] "arm, leg, leg, arm, head", signifying the human body. This was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature. He named parts of the New York area after locations in the Middle East that are significant to Islam: Harlem was referred to as Mecca, and Brooklyn, Medina. Other disaffected NOI members, including some who served the Fruit of Islam, were soon drawn to his burgeoning group. Several people from the NOI who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to Elijah Muhammad and MalcolmX also joined; Clarence13X incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders. In the group's early years, some Five Percenters attended NOI events, and Clarence13X's theology had much in common with the teachings of the NOI, although there were notable differences. He taught his followers that he was an incarnation of God, and they each were gods. His followers were thus encouraged to look <b>within</b> <b>themselves</b> in their search for God. Clarence13X taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of African descent not found in Europeans and their descendants, echoing statements made by Elijah Muhammad. He did not enforce the NOI's strict moral rules: one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the NOI, including gambling, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Clarence13X told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong. He strictly forbade the consumption of pork, arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the United States, such as rats and dogs, and hence should not be consumed. Owing to their belief that black men are gods, the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet.|$|E
