5|$|Make Way for Ducklings {{was adapted}} into an 11-minute {{black-and-white}} cartoon created by Weston Woods in 1955. Founded by educator Morton Schindel in 1953, Weston Woods Studios, Inc.(named after the <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> outside {{his home in}} Weston, Connecticut) specializes in animating children's picture books on film. The program is centered toward young struggling readers who, after watching the movie, are encouraged to read the books themselves.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} onward, traveling north {{through a}} rural, <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> of Pawling with little development before curving west {{to pass along}} {{the southern edge of}} Whaley Lake. At the southwestern tip of the lake, NY292 turns north, paralleling the western and northern shores of the lake as it heads toward the hamlet of West Pawling. North of the lake in West Pawling, NY292 turns east onto a former routing of NY55 for a short distance before ending at modern NY55 in the northwest corner of Pawling.|$|E

5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in a <b>wooded</b> <b>area.</b> At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a dead end.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large <b>wooded</b> <b>area,</b> as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
5|$|NY117 begins {{just north}} of the village of Sleepy Hollow at an {{interchange}} with US9 (Broadway) in the town of Mount Pleasant. The route proceeds generally northeastward along Phelps Way, a four-lane, divided highway bypass of Sleepy Hollow and Kykuit, the Rockefeller family's estate. For its first , the highway runs through a <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> along the northern edge of the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, crossing under several of the park's hiking and walking trails. Phelps Way ends at the northeastern tip of the park, where NY117 intersects with the northern terminus of NY448 at Bedford Road. While NY448 ends here, Bedford Road continues on as part of NY117.|$|E

5|$|NY99 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY30 {{west of the}} hamlet of Duane Center {{in the town of}} Duane. The route headed eastward as the Port Kent–Hopkinton Turnpike, passing through the small community of Duane Center before entering an isolated, <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> of Franklin County and Adirondack Park. At the Franklin town line, NY99 curved southeastward, roughly paralleling Hatch Brook as it climbed up the northeastern portion of Baldface Mountain. Past the mountain's summit, the route continued onward, winding its way southward along Hatch Brook to a small lake known as Duck Pond.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November the commandos gave {{control of}} Flushing to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and {{prepared}} to move by sea to support {{the rest of the}} brigade at Westkapelle. Before they could disembark, weather conditions deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at Zoutelande. Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days. Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue. By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were holed up in the <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> between Domburg and Vrouwenpolder.|$|E
5|$|The bayside {{residential}} area called La Playa lies somewhat {{north of the}} original La Playa, the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during {{the early days of}} the city. La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The hills above La Playa are known as the <b>Wooded</b> <b>Area</b> on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard (so called because of the many mature trees in the area), and the College Area on the ocean side (because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College). The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side, above ocean bluffs, and is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the junction of Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up {{the pressure on the}} Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large <b>wooded</b> <b>area,</b> as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was involved in this advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E

A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E

5|$|NY144 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9W {{in the town}} of New Baltimore, just north of US9W's junction with County Route51 (CR51). The route heads northeastward through New Baltimore as a two-lane rural roadway, crossing CSX Transportation's West Shore Line before intersecting with a service road that connects to the New Baltimore Travel Plaza on the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY144 passes by a stretch of homes alongside the Thruway and crosses over the toll road, at which point the road enters a residential but <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> of the town. This stretch leads to the hamlet of New Baltimore, located on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River. In the residential center of the community, NY144 intersects with the northern terminus of CR61 (River Road). At this junction, NY144 makes a turn northward, following the riverbank out of the hamlet.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, Montgomery led a probing {{force to}} Fort St. Johns, {{the key to}} the British defense of Montreal. Montgomery led the main body of troops toward the fort through a marshy and heavily <b>wooded</b> <b>area.</b> A {{flanking}} party led by Captain Matthew Mead was ambushed by 100 Native Americans allied to the British. The party held its ground, forcing the ambushing Natives to fall back to the fort. Montgomery, fearing that the British force was larger than he had anticipated, called off operations {{for the rest of the}} day and withdrew his force to a spot beyond the range of the British guns. Believing that the fort could not be captured quickly, Schuyler recalled Montgomery's force and fortified Île aux Noix.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
