500|$|After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had {{difficulty}} {{finding a new}} subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced {{that it would be}} expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, [...] "Will <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it? [...] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A." [...] Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Say Yes" [...] was filmed on May 20, 2014 and {{directed}} by Matthew A. Cherry. The clip was filmed {{in a house in}} Maplewood, New Jersey, where a crowd gathered the watch the trio on set. Following that, filming was cordoned by local police. Several pictures of Beyoncé arriving on set were shared on social networks by fans. Williams debuted the clip for [...] "Say Yes" [...] on her appearance at Good Morning America on June 18, 2014. Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home. Bring it back together because when we were together, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> how we were when we were younger, just always laughing and talking about things. It's been a great moment." [...] The video was released on Williams' Vevo account the same day. A behind-the-scenes footage was also released featuring the trio on set and talking about the song and their reunion. In the clip, Williams said she felt excited that she had her [...] "sisters" [...] with her spreading a positive message for the world.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kaskaskia, Colonel Clark, Tom, and myself, {{and a great}} {{weight was}} lifted from our hearts.|$|R
500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, {{sitting in}} this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} a cheerful funeral, and yet {{we are not in}} great spirits as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the city.|$|E
60|$|It is {{now time}} that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Rocket {{and see how}} Dick and those with him were faring.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house, where, of course, {{we looked}} at some wood work, agates, and all the et cetera.|$|R
60|$|After dinner <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the drawing}} rooms again; and while tea and coffee were being served, names were {{constantly}} being announced, till {{the rooms were}} quite full.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} offer you my thanks, Miss Stirling, but they're very sincere," [...] he said. [...] "Don't {{you think it}} would be better if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|WANKLIN. We're all here, Chairman; {{what do you}} say? Shall we get on {{with the}} business, or shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the other room? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pretty things! fine things!" [...] {{cried the}} little girl enthusiastically, holding up two {{glittering}} fragments of mica. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> home I'll give them to brother Bob." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you're {{not sure}} about the way, wouldn't it be better if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Jake?" [...] he suggested. [...] "It seems a pity we didn't think of it earlier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we are to}} {{hunt for}} Kenton, or count on {{learning}} what has become of him, {{would it not be}} better that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the canoe, and waited for the coming of day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do so when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fort," [...] Isaac cried gleefully, [...] "and side by {{side you}} and I will see many a brave adventure." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the smoke-house? There we {{can talk}} it over with the others, an' {{at the same time}} get {{something}} by way of breakfast." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> old Mary's cabin where Uncle 'Rasmus, {{despite his}} seeming feebleness, had made ready for us a most appetizing meal, by warming the corn-bread and {{toasting}} {{some of the}} boiled ham in a frying-pan.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house; the Sergeant {{requesting}} that I {{would give him}} a room to himself, and then send in the servants (the indoor servants only), one after another, in the order of their rank, from first to last.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} must be late," [...] said Tom. [...] "I was getting hungry. Let us get a bite of {{something}} before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{might be}} equal to it," [...] {{answered}} Dick, soberly. [...] "We'll have to keep our eyes peeled, and, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Brill, we'll have to warn dad and Uncle Randolph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do now?" [...] asked Dorothy. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Emerald City, as we are, and then visit Glinda the Good and ask her to break the enchantments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After this <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the station, {{and then}} came home. I thought from the map that <b>we</b> should <b>go</b> through Paisley; but we did not. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> over it. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> over it, higher than {{the tops of the}} chimneys.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our tent; {{but not to}} sleep. There is {{a mighty}} lot of {{excitement}} in turning out at night to be shot at, and Darius was {{the only member of}} our party who felt inclined to lie down.|$|R

6000|$|They rode in silence. Ida sighed deeply. At {{last she}} said: [...] "It's only an {{incident}} with us. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our pleasant and varied lives; {{they go back}} to their lonely homes, and to their bleak corn-fields." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our sleeping-place in silence. Well {{might we}} be silent, for of food {{we had only}} enough left for a single scanty meal.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the tavern}} hoping against hope that Legros {{had not yet}} turned out {{the pockets of the}} blouse, and that we might induce him, by threat or cajolery or the usurious {{interest}} of twenty-five sous, to grant his client a further twenty-four hours wherein to redeem the pledge.|$|R
