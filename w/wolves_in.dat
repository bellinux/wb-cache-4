5|$|In Alaska, {{the gray}} wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times. DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics {{similar to those of}} <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the Great Lakes Region.|$|E
5|$|Coat color {{ranges from}} almost pure white through various shades of blond, cream, and ochre to grays, browns, and blacks, with {{variation}} in fur color tending {{to increase in}} higher latitudes. Differences in coat color between sexes are largely absent, though females may have redder tones. Black-colored <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> North America inherited the Kb allele responsible for melanism from past interbreeding with dogs, while the mutation {{was found to be}} naturally occurring in wolves from Iran. Black specimens are more common in North America than in Eurasia, with about half the <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone National Park being black.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{found in}} the BWCAW include deer, moose, beaver, timber wolves, black bears, bobcats, bald eagles, {{peregrine}} falcons and loons. It is {{within the range of}} the largest population of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the contiguous United States, as well as an unknown number of Canada lynx. It has also been identified by the American Bird Conservancy as a globally important bird habitat.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} with Milwaukee in the AHL the following season and scored his first professional goal on October 14, 2009, against Hannu Toivonen in a 5–2 win against the Peoria Rivermen. Blum finished the campaign with 11 goals and 30 assists for 41 points, third among all rookie defensemen in the league. He then added eight points in seven playoff games as the Admirals were eliminated by the Chicago <b>Wolves</b> <b>in</b> the opening round.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern Europe, wolves {{were never}} fully exterminated, {{because of the}} area's {{contiguity}} with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late nineteenth century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century and, by the mid-twentieth century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. <b>Wolves</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. <b>Wolves</b> <b>in</b> Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all-time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extermination of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the eighteenth century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps.|$|E
5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death {{have become the}} subjects of modern art and literature. His death was a popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than <b>wolves.</b> <b>In</b> Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.|$|E
5000|$|The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> Mexico was {{directed}} by D. Ross Lederman and was written by Martin Goldsmith, Maurice Tombragel and Phil Magee. After a sickly Warren Williams decided to discontinue playing the title detective Michael Landyard, also known as Lone Wolf, Gerald Mohr was roped in by Columbia Pictures, the producer and the distributor, to play the character in The Notorious Lone Wolf (1946) and The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> London (1947), {{as well as the}} The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> Mexico marked the penultimate Lone <b>Wolf</b> film <b>in</b> which Mohr starred as the title character. Principal photography with the working title of The Lone Wolf's Invitation to Murder, commenced on September 4, 1946, and finished on September 18, 1946, taking place in Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> London was {{directed}} by Leslie Goodwins and was written by Brenda Weisberg and Arthur E. Orloff Gerald Mohr was signed by Columbia Pictures to play the lead character in three films in the popular series: The Notorious Lone Wolf (1946) and The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> Mexico (1947), {{as well as the}} The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> London. The Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>in</b> London marked the last Lone <b>Wolf</b> film <b>in</b> which Mohr starred as the title character. The film was followed up with The Lone Wolf and His Lady (1949) with a new lead actor, Ron Randell, after which Columbia decided {{to bring an end to}} the film series. Principal photography commenced on May 19, 1946, and finished on May 29, 1947, taking place in studio settings at Columbia Pictures Corporation.|$|R

5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP {{and another}} dated 13,000YBP. The {{results showed that}} the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> elk population management.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E

5|$|Romania {{has a large}} {{population}} of wolves, numbering 2,500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although the law is not enforced. The number of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> Albania and Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon.

5|$|The {{extermination}} of Northern Europe's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages, and continued {{until the late}} 1800s. In England, wolf persecution was enforced by legislation, and the last wolf {{was killed in the}} early sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VII. Wolves lasted longer in Scotland, where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest, which were subsequently burned down. Wolves managed to survive in the forests of Braemar and Sutherland until 1684. The extirpation of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> Ireland followed a similar course, with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786. A wolf bounty was introduced in Sweden in 1647, after the {{extermination of}} moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock. The Sami extirpated <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> northern Sweden in organized drives. By 1960, few wolves remained in Sweden, because of the use of snowmobiles in hunting them, with the last specimen being killed in 1966. The gray wolf was exterminated in Denmark in 1772 and Norway's last wolf was killed in 1973. The species was decimated in 20th century Finland, despite regular dispersals from Russia. The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900, though its numbers increased after World War II.|$|E
5|$|This {{match is}} also the highest home {{attendance}} in the Wigan Warriors' history at the stadium. The twenty thousand mark has been broken ten times since moving to the new stadium in 1999—eight times against St Helens RLFC, once against local rivals Warrington <b>Wolves</b> <b>in</b> the opening round of the 2008 Super League XIII season, and once in July 2009 against the Leeds Rhinos following a campaign advertising the game as the 'Big One'. In 2010, the Warriors were officially the biggest supported team in the Super League.|$|E
5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of <b>wolves</b> <b>in</b> China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E
