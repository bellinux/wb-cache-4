5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Imogen was unsure that she could maintain a working relationship with Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 decided she would retire as artistic director after the 1977 festival. That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert. On retirement, she accepted the honorary title of Artistic Director Emeritus.|$|E

In all, she made nine attacks; on 16 April, she fired two torpedoes at tanker Kitami Maru. One hit, {{and she was}} {{credited}} with a sinking; this was not verified by postwar examination of Japanese records. Tambor returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 May, where her skipper criticized the torpedoes.|$|E

25|$|Although he did {{not hold}} her {{responsible}} for Alpha's loss, Sir Alan raised doubts about whether Lucinda was emotionally strong enough {{to continue in the}} process, after Jenny turned hostile against her by the halfway point of the task on the belief that she wasn't working fast enough, berating Sara <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> up for her, while remaining hostile throughout the boardroom. While Jenny was lambasted for her many errors, including her lack of involvement in the pricing strategies, her appalling behaviour towards her teammates, particularly to Lucinda, earned her a warning she would be fired if she acted in this way again.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} when his best friend, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), hired him to be run the Emergency Department. Craig at first clashed with Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) before the two briefly dated. The arrival of Craig's ex-wife, Paula (Vivian Bell) and his brother Brett (Colin Moy), for whom she had left Craig, caused trouble when Brett died and Paula tried to reignite the marriage. Craig kicked Paula out and in 2005 started to date Huia (Nicola Kawana). However, he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Sarah to return to him over fiancé Andrew (Paolo Rotondo). Craig's anger problems began to destroy his relationship with Huia and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> him down for an outburst, he broke it off and returned to Sarah. However, while at a conference, Craig had a one-night stand with, and impregnated, Huia. Sarah broke it off with him and Huia and their child died in an explosion. Craig confessed his love for Sarah only to lose out on her to Huia's cousin TK (Benjamin Mitchell).|$|E
500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you could see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E

25|$|Éowyn's theme: using open fifth {{intervals}} (lacking {{the third}} of the chord – {{this means that the}} chords cannot be defined as major or minor) which is common for the music of Gondor, implying Eowyn's eventual connection to Faramir. It is used when we first see her, again <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> before Edoras.

Members of the National Guard followed the march, with Lafayette reluctantly leading them. At Versailles, the king accepted the Assembly's votes on the Declaration, but refused requests to go to Paris. At dawn, the crowd broke into the palace. Lafayette took the royal family onto the palace balcony and attempted to restore order. The crowd insisted that the king and his family move to Paris and the Tuileries Palace. The king came onto the balcony, and the crowd started chanting [...] "Vive le Roi!" [...] When the unpopular queen, Marie Antoinette, appeared there with her children, she was told to send the children back in. [...] When she returned alone, people shouted to shoot her, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> her ground, no one opened fire. Lafayette kissed her hand, leading to cheers from the crowd.|$|E

50|$|The {{narrative}} bookends {{these scenes}} from Édith's middle life with repeated vignettes of an aged-looking Édith with frizzy red hair, being nursed and tended to. She {{spends much of}} her time sitting in a chair by the lakeside, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>she</b> has the stooped posture and slowness of a much older person. Another set of fractured memories shows Édith with short curly hair, plastered to her face as though she is feverish, singing on stage and collapsing while she tries to sing, a moment when Édith herself realizes that her body is betraying her, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is hosting a party at a Parisian bistro, and topples a bottle of champagne because of her developing arthritis, and to the morphine addiction that ultimately plays a large role in her demise, as she injects the drug with a young lover in her bedroom.|$|R

She was equally unsuccessful <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> as a British National Party candidate in the 1992 general election in Dewsbury. Through much of her later life, she published the journal Choice, which presented a right-wing stance but was generally independent of any political party.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{strong and}} powerful, the {{mountain}} gorillas are generally gentle and very shy. Severe aggression {{is rare in}} stable groups, but when two mountain gorilla groups meet, the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries. For this reason, conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviors that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical. The ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps: (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3) rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running four-legged, (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground with palms [...] Jill Donisthorpe stated that a male charged at her twice. In both cases the gorilla turned away, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stood</b> her ground.|$|E

For her part, she shall say, and that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> where <b>she</b> must suddenly fall, 'I shall be a lady for ever' (Isa 47:7-9).

[...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door.
