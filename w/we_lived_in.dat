5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|Frith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a sextet {{and review}} band for {{performing}} selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions {{from the previous}} 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), René Lussier (guitar, bass guitar), Jean Derome (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and Kevin Norton (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union. A double CD, That House <b>We</b> <b>Lived</b> <b>In,</b> from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
500|$|First-time {{director}} Conran incorporated many {{references to}} classic genre films {{into his own}} movie: [...] "The work of those artists and writers from the pulps and Golden Age of Comic Books like Airboy was really the template for us.

500|$|The {{term and}} the analogy with the {{castaway}} {{has often been}} made by Robinsons in their own memoirs, {{as well as by}} other writers. Dawid Fogelman had been imprisoned at the Gęsiówka concentration camp. After the camp was liberated by the Polish Home Army, he joined its ranks and fought in the uprising. At the end of the fighting, Fogelman became a Robinson, hiding in a bunker on Szczęśliwa Street, where he began writing a diary. He wrote: [...] "We lived like Robinson Crusoe, with the one difference that he was free, could move about freely, while <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> hiding." [...] While Fogelman's diary survived, his ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
500|$|The waltz ballad [...] "Domaine de Planousset" [...] was {{performed}} live by Frith several times, including at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville in Quebec, Canada with René Lussier in October 1986, {{and at the}} Bahnhof Langendreer in Bochum, Germany with Frith's band, Keep the Dog in mid-1991. The performance with Lussier was released as [...] "Domaine Revisited" [...] on Nous Autres in 1987, and the performance with Keep the Dog was released as [...] "Domaine de Langendreer" [...] on That House <b>We</b> <b>Lived</b> <b>In</b> in 2003.

500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Smith {{released}} his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, [...] "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that really came from. It was all an expression about [...] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred {{to the streets of}} Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where my ideas came from." [...] In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E
500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit to my parents. <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> a lovely terrace house and we all had each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E

500|$|Panait Cerna's {{father was}} an ethnic Bulgarian schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov). He settled in Cerna and married Maria Taşcu. The {{daughter}} of local peasants, she was of Aromanian or of Bulgarian origin. Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian nationalist, refused to accept this change and left for the Principality of Bulgaria, leaving his family behind. Consequently, Cerna never met his father. By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: [...] " [...] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> {{a house on the}} outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms. Can you imagine living in the middle of winter, without a fire on, with doors that barely close, with windows that are glued with paper? A person made of iron would still feel cold down to the bone." ...|$|E
500|$|Turner also {{appeared}} in four films with Clark Gable between 1941 and 1954, beginning with Honky Tonk (1941). The Turner-Gable films' successes were heightened by gossip-column rumors about {{a relationship between the}} two. In January 1942, she began shooting her second picture with Gable, titled Somewhere I'll Find You; however, the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gable's wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Meanwhile, the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen, which Turner vehemently denied. Consequently, the publicity generated by this would lead MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in her following film, a romantic comedy titled Slightly Dangerous (1943). In promotion of Somewhere I'll Find You, Turner embarked on a nationwide war bond tour, during which she returned to her hometown of Wallace, Idaho with her mother, where she was greeted with a large celebration: [...] "We checked into our hotel, and were told that the Mayor had declared a holiday in my honor," [...] she recalled. [...] "A banner stretched across the street read, in large letters, WELCOME HOME, LANA. We'd been in our rooms only a few moments when people who claimed to have known us when <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Wallace began knocking on the door." ...|$|E
500|$|Benn {{asserted}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a [...] "radical political importance" [...] on his life, and made {{a distinction between the}} historical Jesus as [...] "a carpenter of Nazareth" [...] who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and [...] "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a [...] "great mistake" [...] to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was [...] "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx". Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. [...] "I've never thought we can understand the world <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> unless we understood the history of the church", Benn said to the Catholic Herald. [...] "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now – well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell." [...] According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman, Benn [...] "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus". Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as [...] "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was [...] "a Christian agnostic" [...] who believed [...] "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of [...] "humanist".|$|E
