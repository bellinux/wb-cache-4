40|$|Non-autoclaved foam {{concrete}} is an advanced thermal insulation material. Until recently, {{foam concrete}} production {{has been based}} on separate preparation of foam and solution, followed by their blending in a mixer. The situation changed when high-quality synthetic foaming agents and turbulence cavitation technology appeared on the market. Every model provides a dependence between the foam concrete strength and the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio.</b> According to the water-cement ratio we can distinguish strong concrete mixtures (with the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> equal to 0. 3 … 0. 4) and ductile ones (with the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> equal to 0. 5 … 0. 7). Strong concrete mixtures are more durable. The lower the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> the higher the foam concrete strength. However super-plastic substances cannot be mixed by ordinary turbulent mixers. Foam concrete produced using the turbulence cavitation technology needs air-entraining, its intensity being dependent on several factors. One of the main factors is the amount of free water, if it is insufficient, the mixture will not be porous enough. A researcher needs to identify the optimal <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> based on the water consumption rate. Practical production of prefabricated concrete products and structures has proven that the reduction of the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> improves the strength of the product. The task is to find the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> for the foam concrete mixture to be plastic enough for air entraining. An increase in the ratio causes loss in the strength.

Various service life prediction models based on chloride induced corrosion have been developed. Temperature {{plays an important role}} in modeling chloride transport in cement-based materials. However, it is often overlooked. In this paper, the effect of temperature on non-steady-state migration and diffusion coefficients of chloride ion in concrete with water-to-cement ratios of 0. 35, 0. 48 and 0. 6 were investigated. Non-steady-state migration coefficient was measured at 20 °C adn 5 °C following NT build 492. Non-steady-state diffusion coefficient was measured at 5 °C, 20 °C and 40 °C according to NT build 443. The effect of temperature on migration/diffusion coefficient is examined by using Arrhenius Equation. The results show that higher temperatures result in higher diffusion/migration coefficients. Temperatures alter the chloride penetration depth, but not the trend of chloride profile. The activation energy obtained from non-steady-state migration coefficient is quite comparable to Samson and Marchand’s results (Cement and Concrete Research, V 37, 2007, 455 - 468), which is around 20 kJ/mol, and independent of <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, the activation energy obtained from non-steady-state diffusion tests ranges from 17. 9 to 39. 9 kJ/mol, which seems dependent on <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio.</b> The surface chloride concentration is also affected by <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> and temperature...|$|E

40|$|Absorption and {{desorption}} are a {{transport property}} {{that affects the}} durability of concrete [1]. Recent work shows that absorption and desorption {{can be used to}} determine the freeze-thaw durability of concrete elements [2]. This work examines various aspects of concrete drying and wetting. First, this work examines the absorption of partially dried concrete. Second, this work assesses desorption-absorption isotherms for concrete mixtures and considers the effect of air content on the water absorption behavior of concrete. Third, the work assesses the drying behavior of concrete. In this study, three tests were used to investigate water transport in concrete: the water absorption test, dynamic vapor desorption test, and drying test. Four series of samples were used: ^ Series 1 : <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 45 AE 90 ^ Series 2 : <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 40 AE 90 ^ Series 3 : <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 40 AE 90 + water reducer ^ Series 4 : <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> = 0. 35 AE 90 + water reducer ^ The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 1585 - 13 [3] is a common test method that is used to determine the initial sorption, secondary sorption, and total absorption of partially saturated concrete. In this study, absorption tests were conducted using concrete with different water-to-cement ratios, varying air contents and air void quality, and different sample conditioning at 50 percent and 75 percent relative humidity (RH). Because the use of mass change alone is insufficient to characterize concrete performance, the degree of saturation (DOS) was used to describe the behavior of the samples. Plots of the DOS versus the square root of time also were developed. The results indicate that, as expected, the samples conditioned at 50 percent RH can absorb more water than samples from the same mixture that were conditioned at 75 percent RH. Also, the samples that contained a higher volume of air had a lower DOS after conditioning. This study found that secondary sorption is not related to air content. ^ The dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) test was used to determine the desorption and absorption of a sample 5 -mm x 4 -mm x 1 -mm thick that was saturated in limewater. This test was used to determine how the water vacated and filled the air voids, capillary pores and gel pores. The DVS results show the mass changes of the samples. The results also show that the higher the <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio,</b> the more the water in the sample is absorbed and desorbed. ^ The third test employed in this study was a drying test that followed a SIMCO laboratory test protocol [4]. In this test, 100 -mm diameter cylindrical samples were cut to 50 mm in thickness. After the samples were saturated in limewater, they were placed in a 50 percent RH chamber. The mass changes were reported after 30 days [4]. The results show that the higher <b>water-to-cement</b> <b>ratio</b> samples lost more water than the samples with lower water-to-cement ratios. ...|$|E
