5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have {{a visceral}} and {{emotional}} reaction to things, {{rather than to}} have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

25|$|Tasmania {{was named}} the 'bogan capital of Australia' with Taswegians earning four spots in the final. This {{prompted}} a response from Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, who affirmed that Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> share their stories and if that makes them bogans, so be it. On the island of Tasmania, half the population has literacy and/or numeracy difficulties, and {{the unemployment rate is}} higher than it is in mainland Australia.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of women believe that antenatal care from a health professional is necessary to determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E
500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> laugh. I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> go see the film and have fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{it stuck}} with him {{throughout}} his professional career {{due to his}} playing style, Greene himself was not fond of the nickname, insisting it did not reflect his true character.

[...] "I {{want to be remembered}} for playing 13 years and contributing to four championship teams. I would like to be remembered for maybe setting a standard for others to achieve." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover photo {{features}} (from left to right) Johnny, Tommy, Joey and Dee Dee Ramone, {{staring at}} the camera with blank faces. They are all wearing ripped/faded blue jeans and leather jackets, standing upright against the brick wall of a private community garden called Albert's Garden, located in the Bowery neighborhood of New York City between Bowery Street and Second Street. The stance of the group members in the photograph would influence their future cover designs as well, {{with the majority of}} their succeeding albums using a picture of the band on the front cover. Music historian Legs McNeil states that [...] "Tommy [...] standing on his tip-toes and Joey [...] hunched over a bit." [...] The back cover art, which depicts a belt buckle with a bald eagle and the band's logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. Liner notes on the back cover fail to acknowledge backing vocalists and additional instrument players. Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get confused." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it away. I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step. It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get out of the album.|$|E

500|$|... "When I wrote American Life, I {{was very}} {{agitated}} {{by what was}} going on in the world around me, [...] I was angry. I had a lot to get off my chest.

So you'll see a lot of (my) energy... but there are also going to be other moments that I hope are artistically energetic. I <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel things up close" ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam made a {{conscious}} decision beginning with the release of Vs. to scale back its commercial efforts. [...] "We pulled back after the second record pretty hard," [...] Ament stated. [...] "A lot of {{it had to do with}} being in the eye of the storm and not being able to think straight." [...] The band declined to produce music videos after the very successful [...] "Jeremy", and opted to give fewer interviews as well as make fewer television appearances. [...] "Ten years from now," [...] Ament said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> remember our songs as videos." ...|$|E

5000|$|The prologue is an {{important}} aspect of the book because Valerio uses an in depth narration of {{what it is like to}} be a transsexual to allow his readers to understand the trials and tribulations that one experiences when going through a sex change. In this section, Valerio <b>wants</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand that transsexuals are not simply just a branch of lesbian or gay. He <b>wants</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand that [...] "transsexual identities must be defined and expressed on our own terms". In Valerio's opinion, transsexuals voices and experiences, until more recently, are unheard and incompletely imagined which is one of the reasons he wanted to write this memoir.|$|R
500|$|The Tigers {{retained}} Pérez for the 2007 season, although Leyland {{acknowledged that}} Pérez {{would have to}} improve his play: [...] "I recommended that we trade for him. I take responsibility. I don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get the wrong impression. I like Neifi Pérez, {{but he did not}} perform well. It's that simple." [...] Pérez, however, continued to struggle, posting a [...]172 batting average over the 33 games he played in a Tigers' uniform. One bright spot came on June 12, 2007, when he saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning-ending double play.|$|E
500|$|In a July 2014 {{televised}} {{interview with}} British {{talk show host}} Michael Parkinson Thorpe came out as gay, after years of denying his homosexuality publicly. He stated [...] "I'm comfortable saying I'm a gay man. And I don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> {{feel the same way}} I did. You can grow up, you can be comfortable and you can be gay." [...] He added [...] "I am telling the world that I am gay … and I hope this makes it easier for others now, and even if you've held it in for years, it feels easier to get it out."In 2016 he began dating model Ryan Channing.|$|E

[...] In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor and two masseuses, Torres used resistance stretching trainers, calling it her [...] "secret weapon" [...] for continued success. [...] Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo, Toyota and Bloomberg L.P.|$|E
