25|$|Cyclura ricordi, {{commonly}} known as the Hispaniolan ground iguana, Ricord's ground iguana, Ricord's <b>iguana,</b> or Ricord's <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a critically endangered species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana.</b> It is found on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and is the only known species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> to coexist with the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta). Its natural habitat is dry savanna within three subpopulations in the southwestern Dominican Republic. It is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural encroachment.|$|R
50|$|The Allen Cays <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> or Allen Cays iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata) is an {{endangered}} subspecies {{of the northern}} Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> that is found on Allen's Cay in the Bahamas. Its status is Endangered, with a wild population of 1,000 animals, {{and it can be}} found on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{generic name}} Cyclura, {{is derived from}} the Greek words cyclos, meaning [...] "circular", and urus meaning [...] "tail", after the thick ringed tail {{characteristic}} of all Cyclura iguanas. [...] Its specific name, rileyi, is a Latinized form of the surname of American ornithologist Joseph Harvey Riley, who collected the holotype. As of 1975 two additional subspecific forms have been identified along with the nominal subspecies: the Acklins ground iguana (C. r. nuchalis) and the White Cay iguana (C. r. cristata). Together they {{are one of the most}} threatened species of all the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> and are described as critically endangered according to the current IUCN Red List.|$|E

50|$|In this region, Island Conservation works {{primarily}} in Puerto Rico, The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. In May 2012, Island Conservation and the Bahamas National Trust {{worked together to}} remove invasive house mice from Allen Cay to protect native species including the Allen Cay Rock Iguana, and Audubon's Shearwater. Since 2008, Island Conservation and the USFWS have worked together to remove invasive vertebrates from Desecheo NWR in Puerto Rico, primarily benefiting the Higo Chumbo cactus, three endemic reptiles, two endemic invertebrates, and to recover globally significant seabird colonies of Brown Boobies, Red-footed Boobies, and Bridled Terns. Future work will focus on important seabird populations, key reptile groups including <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Iguanas,</b> and the restoration of Mona Island, Alto Velo, and offshore cays in the Puerto Rican Bank and The Bahamas. Key partnerships include the USFWS, Puerto Rico DNER, the Bahamas National Trust, and the Dominican Republic Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclura is a genus of lizards in {{the family}} Iguanidae. Member species of this genus are {{commonly}} known as [...] "cycluras" [...] or more commonly as <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> and only occur on islands in the West Indies. <b>Rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> have a high degree of endemism, with a single species or subspecies restricted to individual islands.|$|R
50|$|Like all Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas,</b> {{this species}} is {{protected}} in the Bahamas under the Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968.

50|$|Like all Cyclura species, the Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 58 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids, lizards, and carrion. It {{has been noted}} that in captivity, it eats both animal and plant food. Gerber and Iverson write that the Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> may live at least 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclura rileyi, {{commonly}} known as the Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> or the San Salvador <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a critically endangered species of lizard native to three island groups in the Bahamas. The species is in decline due to habitat encroachment by human development and predation by feral dogs and cats. There are three subspecies: the Acklins ground iguana (Cyclura rileyi nuchalis), the White Cay iguana (Cyclura rileyi cristata), in addition to the nominotypical subspecies (Cyclura rileyi rileyi [...] ).|$|R

50|$|The Turks and Caicos <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> inhabits small cays, but {{has been}} reduced to less than 5% of its {{original}} range largely due to the introduction of predators.|$|R
25|$|Like other herbivorous lizards, the <b>rock</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{presented}} with a special problem for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and has less nutritional content per gram than meat so more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs. Unlike mammals, reptile kidneys cannot concentrate urine to save on water intake. Instead reptiles excrete toxic nitrogenous wastes as solid uric acid through their cloaca. In {{the case of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> which consumes large amounts of vegetation, these excess salt ions are excreted through their salt gland {{in the same manner as}} birds.|$|R
5000|$|The Allen Cays <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> Cyclura cychlura inornata, is {{endemic to}} Leaf Cay and {{southwest}} Allen's Cay {{in the northern}} Exuma Island chain in the Bahamas. [...] It {{is one of three}} subspecies of the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> the others being the Andros Island iguana (Cyclura cychlura cychlura) and the Exuma Island iguana (Cyclura cychlura figginsi). [...] Its generic name (Cyclura) is derived from the Ancient Greek cyclos (κύκλος) meaning [...] "circular" [...] and ourá (οὐρά) meaning [...] "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all Cyclura species.|$|R

5000|$|The San Salvador <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is an {{endangered}} species of lizard of the genus Cyclura in the family Iguanidae. First described by Leonhard Stejneger in 1903, it is known commonly in the Bahamas as simply [...] "iguana".|$|R
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Cyclura nubila are the Grand Cayman blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi) and the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cychlura); phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three species diverged {{from a common}} ancestor three million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Like all Cyclura species, the {{northern}} Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from over 100 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds and fungi.|$|R
50|$|Popular meat {{dishes are}} made with chicken, pork, and goat (also {{referred}} to as mutton). Iguana is still hunted and eaten, especially in the outlying islands, although some species, such as the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana,</b> are endangered.|$|R

50|$|Its closest {{relatives}} are the Cuban iguana (Cyclura nubila) and the Northern Bahamian <b>rock</b> <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cychlura), the three species having diverged {{from a common}} ancestor some three million years ago. The species has a low genetic diversity but {{does not seem to}} suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of <b>rock</b> <b>iguana.</b> One theory is that the species evolved from a single female Cuban iguana (C. nubila nubila) with eggs inside her who drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm. It is distinct from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis, although it can breed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.|$|R
