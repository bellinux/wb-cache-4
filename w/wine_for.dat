5|$|French chemist Pierre Joseph Pelletier and French {{pharmacist}} Joseph Bienaimé Caventou {{separated in}} 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered fever tree bark, {{allowing for the}} creation of standardized doses of the active ingredients.

5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} <b>wine</b> <b>for</b> pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, {{and is one of}} the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|Wine was {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve <b>wine</b> <b>for</b> the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty stomach}} was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY charged Milošević {{with the}} {{extermination}} of non-Serb civilians in Erdut, the forcible transfer {{of at least}} 2,500 inhabitants of the village and destruction of their property. Milošević's trial commenced on 12 February 2002, but he died in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached. The SDG, which became the most powerful paramilitary formation in eastern Slavonia, and Ražnatović gained notoriety for war crimes and ethnic cleansing. The SDG systematically plundered villages in the region, turning the area into a source of oak lumber, crude oil and <b>wine</b> <b>for</b> Ražnatović to sell in Serbia, and in Erdut itself. Ražnatović was never charged for any war crimes committed by the SDG in Erdut. The ICTY only charged him with several war crimes committed in or near Sanski Most. He was assassinated in Belgrade on 15 January 2000 before he could stand trial.|$|E
