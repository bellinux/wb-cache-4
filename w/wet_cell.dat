5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
25|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> battery has {{a liquid}} electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{dry cell}} uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough {{moisture}} to allow current to flow. Unlike a <b>wet</b> <b>cell,</b> a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods {{hanging from the}} open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. Lead–acid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until {{the development of the}} gel battery.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{finite volume}} {{algorithm is proposed}} for modeling the free surface flows. The effects of variable reconstruction and treatments for partially <b>wetted</b> <b>cells</b> on numerical oscillations are demonstrated through a complex field-scale simulation. Results show {{that the combination of}} a vertex-based slope limiting approach and an updating strategy that the continuity and momentum equations should be simultaneously updated for partially <b>wetted</b> <b>cells</b> is essential to prevent unphysical oscillations. In this situation, the bed slope terms in <b>wetted</b> <b>cells</b> are exactly discretized, whereas the divergence-form-based approach is adopted for partially <b>wetted</b> <b>cells.</b> This new hybrid method provides an alternative way that precisely preserves the well-balanced property. A practical application of realistic dam-break flood propagation is presented. It is found that the model is free of numerical oscillation and can accurately predict dam-break flows over complicated topography with wetting and drying...|$|R
25|$|These <b>wet</b> <b>cells</b> used liquid electrolytes, {{which were}} prone to leakage and {{spillage}} if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars {{to hold their}} components, which made them fragile and potentially dangerous. These characteristics made <b>wet</b> <b>cells</b> unsuitable for portable appliances. Near {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the invention of dry cell batteries, which replaced the liquid electrolyte with a paste, made portable electrical devices practical.|$|R

500|$|In Bell's June 2003 lawsuit, Bell {{accused the}} federal {{government}} of extorting the 1997 plea agreement from him. Bell asserted that when he balked at that agreement in November 1997, {{in part due to}} the government's violation of the terms, government agents instructed fellow inmate Ryan Thomas Lund to assault Bell. The lawsuit alleged that Lund did this at about 6:00 P.M. on November 25, 1997, for the purpose of intimidating Bell, and to keep Bell away from his family and the news media. Later, in an ostensibly unrelated event, Lund filed a lawsuit stating that on December 14, 1997, two days after Bell's December 12, 1997 sentencing, Lund (who was in solitary confinement at the time due to his assault on Bell) had a [...] "slip and fall" [...] accident while alone in his cell, ostensibly due to a <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> floor. Lund had also been promised a 27-month sentence for his illegal possession of firearms and methamphetamine, when the relevant federal law required a mandatory 10-year sentence. Bell alleged that the sentence reduction and lawsuit payoff were engineered to reward Lund for extorting Bell. Bell claimed that he was kept under [...] "inhumane conditions for at least ten days".|$|E

40|$|Reduced {{downstream}} costs, {{together with}} high purity recovery of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), will accelerate {{the commercialization of}} high quality PHA-based products. In this work, a process was designed for effective recovery of the copolymer poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyhexanoate) (P(HB-co-HHx)) containing high levels of HHx (> 15 [*]mol%) from Ralstonia eutropha biomass using non-halogenated solvents. Several non-halogenated solvents (methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, and butyl acetate and ethyl acetate) were found to effectively dissolve the polymer. Isoamyl alcohol {{was found to be}} not suitable for extraction of polymer. All PHA extractions were performed from both dry and <b>wet</b> <b>cells</b> at volumes ranging from 2 [*]mL to 3 [*]L using a PHA to solvent ratio of 2 % (w/v). Ethyl acetate showed both high recovery levels and high product purities (up to 99 %) when using dry cells as starting material. Recovery from <b>wet</b> <b>cells,</b> however, eliminates a biomass drying step during the downstream process, potentially saving time and cost. When <b>wet</b> <b>cells</b> were used, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was shown to be the most favorable solvent for PHA recovery. Purities of up to 99 % and total recovery yields of up to 84 % from <b>wet</b> <b>cells</b> were reached. During polymer recovery with either MIBK or butyl acetate, fractionation of the extracted PHA occurred, based on the HHx content of the polymer. PHA with higher HHx content (17 – 30 [*]mol%) remained completely in solution, while polymer with a lower HHx content (11 – 16 [*]mol%) formed a gel-like phase. All PHA in solution could be precipitated by addition of threefold volumes of n-hexane or n-heptane to unfiltered PHA solutions. Effective recycling of the solvents in this system is predicted due to the large differences in the boiling points between solvent and precipitant. Our findings show that two non-halogenated solvents are good candidates to replace halogenated solvents like chloroform for recovery of high quality PHA. Biotechnol.

2500|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} developed several commercially important types of battery. [...] "Wet cells" [...] were open containers that held liquid electrolyte and metallic electrodes. When the electrodes were completely consumed, the <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> was renewed by replacing the electrodes and electrolyte. Open containers are unsuitable for mobile or portable use. Wet cells were used commercially in the [...] telegraph and telephone systems. Early electric cars used semi-sealed wet cells.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{structural}} characteristic of bacteria is (with some exceptions) their small size. For example, Escherichia coli cells, an [...] "average" [...] sized bacterium, are about 2µm (micrometres) long and 0.5µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. [...] This corresponds to a wet mass of about 1 picogram (pg), assuming that the cell consists mostly of water. The dry mass of a single cell can be estimated as 23% of the wet mass, amounting to 0.2 pg. About half of the dry mass of a bacterial cell consists of carbon, and also about half of it {{can be attributed to}} proteins. Therefore, a typical fully grown 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli (at an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to ca. 109 cells/ml) yields about 1 g <b>wet</b> <b>cell</b> mass. Small size is extremely important because it allows for a large surface area-to-volume ratio which allows for rapid uptake and intracellular distribution of nutrients and excretion of wastes. At low surface area-to-volume ratios the diffusion of nutrients and waste products across the bacterial cell membrane limits the rate at which microbial metabolism can occur, making the cell less evolutionarily fit. The reason for the existence of large cells is unknown, although it is speculated that the increased cell volume is used primarily for storage of excess nutrients.|$|E

Additional analyses revealed the presence of hexose, pentose, heptose, hexosamine, and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonic acid, and the extract was also positive by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay for lipopolysaccharide. An examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that at least 10 different protein bands could be detected. One of the major bands corresponded to the major outer membrane protein, as determined by comparison with an outer membrane protein preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Another major protein in the heated extract corresponded to a band previously shown to be flagellin. An analysis of {{the time course of}} the release of material showed that a significant amount was removed after 3 to 10 min at 100 degrees C, but the release of material seemed to be delayed at lower temperatures. These results show that the treatment of C. jejuni with heat produces a complex mixture of components, including cell wall lipopolysaccharide, the major outer membrane protein, and flagellin. It is likely that some cytoplasmic components are present as well. Blebs of outer membrane have been observed with this organism by electron microscopy.

Cortisol at a physiological concentration (40 nM) did not alter ic Na and K concentrations in these cells. The results suggest that aldosterone binding to specific receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes significantly contributes to the regulation of monovalent cation levels in these cells.
