25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the <b>white</b> <b>cement</b> requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for <b>white</b> <b>cement,</b> and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

The arch itself consists of voussoirs with plastered over, white bricks forming the interior of the arch. Above the arch is a primitive, triangular tympanum the lower line of which extends beyond the raked borders. It is embellished by a fascia on the outer course with a fillet and ovolo on the inner course. It was alternately decorated with <b>white</b> <b>cement,</b> a marble tablet, and now a wash of mortar.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the larger sculptures was {{very similar to the}} temporary Hon installation at the Moderna Museet in 1966, but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain. The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge steel reinforcement bars was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray shotcrete onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of <b>white</b> <b>cement</b> produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This secondary-level animal {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess and compare the subcutaneous tissue reaction to implantation of white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement.</b> Study Design: Polyethylene tubes filled with either freshly mixed white MTA (Group I) or <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement</b> (Group II) were implanted subcutaneously into 12 Wistar Albino rats. Each animal also received an empty polyethylene tube as the control (Group III). After 7, 14, 21 and 30 days, the implants, together with surrounding tissues were excised. Two pathologists blinded to the experimental procedure, evaluated sections taken from the biopsy specimens for the severity of the inflammatory response, calcification and the presence and thickness of fibrous capsule surrounding the implant. Statistical analysis was performed using the Cross-tabs procedure, Univariate analysis of the variance two-way and the Pearson product moment correlation to assess inter-rater variability between the two evaluators. Results: At 7 days, {{there was no significant difference}} in the severity of inflammation between the control group, white MTA, and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement</b> groups. In the 14 day, 21 day and 30 day test periods, control group had significantly less inflammation than white MTA and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement.</b> There was no significant difference in the grading of inflammation between white MTA and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement.</b> All materials exhibited thick capsule at 7 days and thin capsule by 30 days. Conclusion: Both white MTA and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement</b> were not completely non-irritating at the end of 30 days as evidenced by the presence of mild inflammation. However, the presence of a thin capsule around the materials, similar to the control group, indicates good tissue tolerance. White MTA and <b>white</b> Portland <b>cement</b> seem to be materials of comparable biocompatibility...|$|R

Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees.

50|$|White Portland cement {{is used in}} {{combination}} with white aggregates to produce white concrete for prestige construction projects and decorative work. White concrete usually {{takes the form of}} pre-cast cladding panels, since it is not economical to use <b>white</b> <b>cement</b> for structural purposes. White Portland cement is also used {{in combination}} with inorganic pigments to produce brightly colored concretes and mortars. Ordinary cement, when used with pigments, produces colors that may be attractive, but are somewhat dull. With <b>white</b> <b>cement,</b> bright reds, yellows and greens can be readily produced. Blue concrete can also be made, at some expense. The pigments may be added at the concrete mixer. Alternatively, to guarantee repeatable color, some manufacturers supply ready-blended colored cements, using <b>white</b> <b>cement</b> as a base. The whiteness of WOPC is measured as the powdered material having a reflectance value ("L value") in excess of 85%.
