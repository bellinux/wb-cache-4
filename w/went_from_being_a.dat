5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> predominantly Christian city to one with a Muslim majority due {{to much of the}} urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{lived through}} a tumultuous period of Mohave history {{where the people}} <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> {{politically}} independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources {{for the life of}} Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step up and take on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff was a French surgeon born in Russia {{who gained}} fame for his {{technique}} of grafting monkey testicle tissue {{on to the}} testicles of men while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. This {{was one of the}} first medically accepted rejuvenation therapies (before he was proved to be wrong around 1930–1940). The technique brought him a great deal of money, although he was already independently wealthy. As his work fell out of favor, he <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> highly respected surgeon to a subject of ridicule. By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers. Noteworthy people who had the surgery included Harold McCormick, chairman of the board of International Harvester Company, and the aging premier of Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Christianity continued {{on into the}} later periods of the Middle Ages as medical training and practice {{moved out of the}} monasteries and into cathedral schools, though more for the purpose of general knowledge rather than training professional physicians. The study of medicine was eventually institutionalized into the medieval universities. Even within the university setting, religion dictated a lot of the medical practice being taught.For instance, the debate of when the spirit left the body influenced the practice of dissection within the university setting. The universities in the South believed that the soul only animated the body and left immediately upon death. Because of this, the body while still important, <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> subject to an object. However, in the north they believed that it took longer for the soul to leave as it {{was an integral part of}} the body. Though medical practice had become a professional and institutionalized field, the argument of the soul in the case of dissection shows that the foundation of religion was still an important part of medical thought in the late Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect on}} beaver stocks of {{competition}} between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as it <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> source of food and clothing for the Aboriginals to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying {{to cut off the}} Aboriginal middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for over-exploitation of stocks, others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Aboriginals and role of the Europeans in the matter. Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious {{competition between the}} English and the French. However, there is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Aboriginals depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was a breakdown of the relationship between man and animal in the values of the Aboriginals which made them drastically accelerate the exploitation of reserves.|$|E
25|$|In {{the peace}} treaty of 1652 the Susquehannock ceded to Maryland large territories on both shores of the Chesapeake Bay in return for arms and for safety on their {{southern}} flank. This decision was also related to the unrest among Amerindians caused by the Beaver Wars of the late 1650s, in which the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) swept south and west against other tribes and territories to expand their hunting grounds for the fur trade. With the help of Maryland's arms, the Susquehannock fought off the Iroquois Confederacy effectively, and a brief peace followed. In 1666 the Susquehannock decisively defeated two tribes of the Five Nations of the Iroquois, recasting the power relationships in the upper Susquehanna Valley and those into the lower parts of New York. This kept the colony free of incursions by the warlike Iroquois. However, the buffer of the Susquehannock nation soon failed to protect the colony {{from the threat of}} the powerful Iroquois: the Susquehannock tribe became decimated by an epidemic. They <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> regional power to nearly extinct {{in the first years of}} the 1870s. In a later peace with the colonial governments of Virginia and Maryland, the Iroquois agreed in a treaty to absorb their remaining distant cousins, and the remaining Susquehannock people became a mere shadow of their former power. By 1878 only 300 or so remained in the Wyoming Valley.|$|E
25|$|A {{factor was}} {{dispatched}} to Venice {{to seek out}} investment opportunities. He did well and on March 25, 1402, the third branch of the Medici bank was opened. It suffered from some initial mismanagement (by the factor who had previously done so wellhe made the fatal mistake of violating the partnership agreement and loaning money to Germans; on a more humane note, he would eventually become a pauper and be sent 20 florins by Giovanni, who felt that a past partner deserved some charity), but soon was prospering. It was this branch that established the practice of having a general manager's remuneration be paid through shares in the branch that he purchased with his investment. Also in 1402, the first Medici factory was established {{for the production of}} woolen cloth, and then another in 1408. By this point, the Rome branch had established a branch in Naples (closed in 1425 and was replaced with one in Geneva) and Gaeta. It may seem that the Medici bank was flourishing and rapidly expanding its assets across Italy, but nevertheless there were perhaps only 17 employees in total of the bank in 1402, with only five at the central bank in Florence, although they were reasonably well-paid and promotions seem to have been rapid when warranted (such {{as in the case of}} Giuliano di Giovanni di ser Matteo, who <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> clerk in 1401 to a junior partner in 1408).|$|E

The Suns traded the disgruntled Markieff Morris away on February 19, 2016 to the Washington Wizards for Kris Humphries, DeJuan Blair, and the Wizards' first round pick at #13 in the 2016 NBA draft. On March 14, 2016 the Suns were eliminated from playoff contention for a 6th straight season {{making it the}} longest drought in franchise history surpassing the 5 straight misses from the 1970–71 NBA season to the 1974–75 NBA season. However, {{it was also the}} season where a rookie named Devin Booker <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> sixth-man off the bench for Kentucky to being considered a leading force for the future with his play due to injuries to Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight. He earned the team's first NBA All-Rookie Team honors since Amar'e Stoudemire back in 2003. Earl Watson officially became the full-time head coach on April 19, 2016, with his new assistant coaches Jay Triano, former Suns player Tyrone Corbin, Marlon Garnett, and Scott Duncan replacing most of the assistant coaches from the previous season. During the 2016 NBA draft, the Suns drafted the 18 year old Bosnian-born Croatian forward-center Dragan Bender, Washington power forward Marquese Chriss, and Kentucky point guard Tyler Ulis; Chriss was acquired by trading the Suns' 13th and 28th selections, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and the Pistons' 2020 second round pick to the Sacramento Kings. During the 2016 free agency period, the Suns regained former players and fan-favorites Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa under new deals.|$|E

500|$|Hip-hop {{dance is}} a broad {{category}} that includes a variety of styles. The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock, breaking, and the funk styles. Breaking was created in The Bronx, New York, incorporating dances that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s in African-American and Latino communities. In its earliest form, it began as [...] on James Brown's [...] "Good Foot" [...] dance which came out in 1972. Breaking at this period was not primarily floor-oriented as seen today; {{it started out as}} toprock which dancers perform while standing up. An influence on toprock was uprock which was created in Brooklyn, New York. Uprock looks similar to toprock, but it is more aggressive and looks like a fight. Uprock is also performed with partners, but in toprock—and in breaking in general—each person takes turns dancing. In 1973, DJ Kool Herc invented the break beat. A break beat is a rhythmic, musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo. Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills. B-boy and b-girl stands for [...] "break-boy" [...] and [...] "break-girl"; b-boys and b-girls dance to the break of a record. Further influenced by martial arts and gymnastics, breaking <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> purely upright dance style—toprock only—to becoming more floor-oriented.|$|E
