5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females.

40|$|Impairment of hippocampal-dependent spatial {{learning}} <b>and</b> memory <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> affects {{a large segment}} of the aged population. Hippocampal subregions (CA 1, CA 3, and DG) have been previously reported to express both common and specific morphological, functional, <b>and</b> gene/protein alterations <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> cognitive decline. To comprehensively assess gene expression <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> cognitive decline, transcriptomic analysis of CA 1, CA 3, and DG was conducted using Adult (12 M) <b>and</b> <b>Aged</b> (26 M) F 344 xBN rats behaviorally characterized by Morris water maze performance. Each subregion demonstrated a specific pattern of responses <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> cognitive performance.

Analysis of the pathways, processes, and regulators of these transcriptomic changes also exhibit a similar pattern of commonalities and differences across subregions. Gene expression changes between <b>Aged</b> cognitively Intact <b>and</b> <b>Aged</b> cognitively Impaired rats often showed an inversion of the changes between Adult <b>and</b> <b>Aged</b> rats.

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise <b>with</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy <b>with</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting red meat dishes.

The flesh becomes bitter <b>with</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E

In this study, we investigated whether <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> development could affect cardiovascular reactivity to vasoactive substances and catecholamine and arginine vasopressin turnover. No {{significant changes in}} the pressor responses to noradrenaline and to carotid sinus baroreceptor stimulation were observed nor were there significant alterations in reflex tachycardia and bradycardia.

5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases <b>with</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones.

5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak.

L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system.

Clearance of linezolid varies <b>with</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men.

5|$|Miller noted there {{appeared}} to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens <b>with</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all interbred freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were phenotypic variants of a single taxon.|$|E

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs.

This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase <b>with</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds.
