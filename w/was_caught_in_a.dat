5|$|Approaching Artemisium {{towards the}} end of summer, the Persian navy <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After {{arriving}} at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.|$|E

Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry.

5|$|Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and Ryūjō {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Hideho Wada's First Carrier Division. The following month {{the ship was}} chosen to evaluate dive-bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2-C Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft, six Yokosuka B3Y1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen A2N1 Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. Ryūjō participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she {{was attached to the}} IJN Fourth Fleet. The fleet <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. Ryūjō arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun'ichi Kira.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with the}} War of Knives, the United States and France {{were engaged in}} a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the Quasi-War. In late December 1799 the American armed {{schooner}} Experiment was escorting under convoy the brig Daniel and Mary and the schooners Sea Flower, Mary, and Washington to prevent their capture by French privateers. On 1 January 1800, the convoy <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dead calm off {{the north side of the}} present-day Haitian island of Gonâve, in the Bight of Leogane.

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flash flood while driving and was killed.|$|E
5|$|Olid {{sought to}} prevent Las Casas from disembarking, and hastily {{sent a message}} to recall Briones. The two Spanish fleets soon opened fire upon each other while Olid {{attempted}} to negotiate a truce in order to delay Las Casas offshore until Briones returned. Las Casas secretly sent messages to Briones, attempting to buy his support against Olid. Briones, looking out for his own interests, delayed his return. At this point, Las Casas' fleet <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sudden storm and wrecked upon the Honduran coast, killing some of Las Casas' men. The survivors were captured by Olid.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Significant clashes {{from this}} period {{included}} the siege of Kijevo, where over a thousand people were besieged in the inner Dalmatian village of Kijevo, and the Borovo Selo killings, where Croatian policemen engaged Serb paramilitaries in the eastern Slavonian village of Borovo and suffered twelve casualties. Violence gripped eastern Slavonian villages: in Tovarnik, a Croat policeman was killed by Serb paramilitaries on 2 May, while in Sotin, a Serb civilian was killed on 5 May when he <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crossfire between Serb and Croat paramilitaries.

5|$|Willaumez {{achieved}} minor {{success in}} his {{operations in the}} South Atlantic and Caribbean, but <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> summer hurricane on his return journey and his ships were scattered along the Eastern Seaboard of North America. One was intercepted and destroyed by British forces and others were so badly damaged in the storm that {{they were forced to}} shelter in American ports. The survivors gradually returned to Brest during the autumn, the last arriving in early 1807. The campaign was the last significant operation in the Atlantic {{for the remainder of the}} war, and no French squadron of any size left any of the Biscay ports until 1808. The losses suffered by the Brest fleet weakened it so severely that it would not participate in a major operation until 1809, when an attempt to break out of Brest ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads.|$|E
5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his {{force was}} too small to have a serious impact on British trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise {{in the aftermath of the}} destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, limping to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, he <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, and he finally received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and {{he was taken to}} the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took {{a turn for the worse}} in early December. Just when he appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E
5|$|In May 1794, a large French fleet put to sea {{to ensure}} the safety of an American grain convoy and was intercepted far out in the Atlantic at the Glorious First of June by the British Channel Fleet, the most {{powerful}} of the Royal Navy's fleets and the force assigned to restrict French movements from Brest. The French suffered a serious defeat, losing seven ships, but managed to retire in good order and saved the grain convoy. Later in June 1794 the British Fleet again put to sea, but <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> storm and many ships were badly damaged. Its commander Lord Howe retired with his fleet to the anchorage in Torbay and thus there was no British fleet at sea in late October when a powerful French squadron sailed from Brest with the intention of attacking a large merchant convoy sailing from Lisbon to Britain. The force, under the command of Contre-amiral Joseph-Marie Nielly, consisted of the 74-gun ships of the line Marat, Tigre, Droits de l'Homme, Pelletier and Jean-Bart with the frigates Charente, Fraternité, Gentille and the corvette Papillon.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
