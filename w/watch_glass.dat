60|$|A {{boat had}} been lowered by the Golden Rod, and the unfortunates were soon {{conveyed}} upon deck. No particle of either food or drink {{was to be}} found, nor anything save the single paddle and the open Bible which lay across the small man's face. Man, woman, and child had all been dead {{a day at the}} least, and so with the short prayers used upon the seas they were buried from the vessel's side. The small man had at first seemed also to be lifeless, but Amos had detected some slight flutter of his heart, and the faintest haze was left upon the <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> which was held before his mouth. Wrapped in a dry blanket he was laid beside the mast, and the mate forced a few drops of rum every few minutes between his lips until the little spark of life which still lingered in him might be fanned to a flame. Meanwhile Ephraim Savage had ordered up the two prisoners whom he had entrapped at Honfleur. Very foolish they looked as they stood blinking and winking in the daylight from which they had been so long cut off.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the generic}} uses of a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> as {{mentioned}} previously includes as a lid for beakers. In {{this case a}} <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is placed above the container, which {{makes it easier to}} control and alter vapour saturation conditions. Moreover, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is often used to house solids being weighed on the scale. Prior to weighing desired amount of solid, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is placed on the scale, followed by taring or zeroing the scale so that only the weight of the sample substance is obtained.|$|E

50|$|There are two types, <b>Glass</b> <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> and Plastic <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> {{used in the}} laboratory. These watch-glasses are {{available}} in various sizes and widths. Watch-glass are usually thicker than any other glass or plastic lab-ware.|$|R

50|$|Not {{only can}} a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> {{be used for}} observing {{precipitation}} patterns and crystals, {{it can also be}} used for drying solids. When further drying is required, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is often used in cases where a particular type of solid needs to be separated from its comparatively volatile solvent. The solid is spread on a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> and, often time, a folded filter paper is placed above to keep out airborne particles from contaminating the product.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of a spout means that the beaker cannot have a lid. However, when in use, beakers may be covered by a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> to prevent contamination or loss of the contents, but allowing venting via the spout. Alternatively, a beaker may be covered with another larger beaker that has been inverted, though a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is preferable.|$|E
50|$|To {{maximize}} the drying rate, a <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> {{can be placed}} inside a fume hood to provide good air circulation for a adequate amount of time. Another technique used in chemistry laboratories to increase the drying rate is passing a gentle stream of dry air or nitrogen gas over the <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> from an inverted funnel clamped above it.|$|E

We have considered fluences up to about 3 x 1011 cm 2. We evaluated the signal fading and we found that in the first hours after exposure the signal rapidly decreases.

50|$|A <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> is a {{circular}} concave {{piece of glass}} used in chemistry as a surface to evaporate a liquid, to hold solids while being weighed, for heating {{a small amount of}} substance and as a cover for a beaker. The latter use is generally applied to prevent dust or other particles entering the beaker; the <b>watch</b> <b>glass</b> does not completely seal the beaker, so gas exchanges still occur.|$|E

40|$|The present {{communication}} {{is a report}} of {{an investigation of the}} surface tension of the blood serum in patients with severe thyroid intoxication. The general plan of the study has been as follows: Determinations of the surface tension were made upon samples of blood serum from untreated patients immediately upon admission to the hospital. Treatment with iodine (in the form of Lugol's solution) was then given in sufficient amount and over a sufficient period of time to allow an exhibition of its clinical effect, when the surface tension studies were repeated. Later the surface tension was again determined after surgical operation (double partial lobectomy of subtotal thyroidectomy) in order to observe any change resulting from the diminished activity of the thyroid gland due to its partial. removal. In some cases iodine was continued for a short time after operation. The direct reading tensiometer of Du Noiiy (1) was used for making the surface tension determinations, and all the precautions recom-mended by him were carefully followed. The <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> used were of uniform size (diameter 8 cm.) and the same amount of serum, approximately 2 cc., used each time. The glassware used was boiled for two hours in a concentrated solution of sulphuric acid to which had been added 15 cc. saturated solution of potassium bichromate per liter. The <b>watch</b> <b>glasses</b> were washed not longer than two or three days before using and were flamed a short time before use in order to insure uniform spreading of the serum. The greatest care was taken throughout to avoid touching with the hands any glassware, including the collecting apparatus, centrifuge tubes and <b>watch</b> <b>glasses.</b> The blood for the surface tension determinations was collected i...|$|R
