40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to model the deformation and fracture behaviour of wafers used in chocolate confectionery products. Compression and bending tests showed that the mechanical behaviour of the wafer was characteristic of a brittle foam. The <b>wafer</b> <b>sheet</b> was examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to determine the wafer dimensions and to observe the internal microstructure. These images showed that the core of the <b>wafer</b> <b>sheet</b> was more porous than the dense skins of the wafer. An analytical model was developed to calculate the modulus of the wafer core and skin sections. A finite element (FE) model using a simple repetitive geometry of the wafer was implemented. The ‘crushable foam’ material model was the closest fit to the wafer deformation under compression and was applied to the core of the wafer. An alternative FE model was proposed, which used the actual complex architecture of the wafer. To attain the wafer architecture, X-ray Microtomography (XMT) was used on a sample to produce a stack of image slices which were reconstructed as a 3 D volume. The microstructure of the 3 D volume was characterised and then meshed with tetrahedral elements for finite element analysis. The cell walls of the model were given a linear elastic material model and a damage criterion to simulate the fracture of the cell walls. In-situ SEM and XMT experiments were conducted which allowed the deformation and fracture of the <b>wafer</b> <b>sheet</b> to be observed simultaneously as the global mechanical response was recorded. The FE model of the complex architecture was able to predict the deformation behaviour of the wafer in compression. In the future, the model can be used to simulate the cutting process of the wafer, allowing the effect of parameters such as cutting speed and blade dimensions to be determined efficiently.

It is believed possible to bring Cz (Czochralski) Si {{up to the}} same low recombination level as FZ (Float Zone) Si. It is also desirable that solar cell Si meet the following requirements: long minority carrier lifetime (0. 2 ohm-cm p-type with tau less than 500 microsec); repeatedly uniform lifetime (not spread from 50 to 1000 microsec); a lifetime that does not decrease during normal device processing; a silicon <b>wafer</b> <b>sheet</b> that is flat and stays throughout normal device processing; uniform and reasonable mechanical strength; and, manufacture at low cost (less than $ 50 /sq m) ...|$|R

All product epi wafers undergo non-destructive testing which gives data on epi <b>wafer</b> <b>sheet</b> resistance, particle density, and surface roughness. These non-destructive measurements give only a limited view of wafer quality, therefore periodic destructive testing of selected epi wafers (HBT device fabrication and measurement) is required. It is highly desirable to directly measure key epi layer parameters on each product wafer {{in order to continue}} pushing toward the goals of perfect quality and yields. Therefore we have been working with the Laytec EpiTT in situ optical reflectance monitoring system. These data allow for immediate detection of shifts in the epi layers. Therefore problems can be detected and corrective actions taken before failed wafers are grown...|$|R

The spray solution consisted of 3 % w/w phosphoric acid and of a small quantity of two surfactants. The surfactants make it possible that the sprayed liquid, as well as the phosphosilicate glass (PSG) formed in the furnace, completely cover the silicon surface. The PSG became thicker with increasing flow rate of the spray head, whereas sheet resistance (Rsh) first decreased and then increased with increasing PSG thickness.

In commercial solar cells, screen printable silver paste is commonly used to form contact. Factors related to paste chemistry, process conditions and the solar cell wafers influence the contact quality. In this paper, the effect of paste chemistry and emitter sheet resistance on contact quality is described. Several paste chemistries were tested for contact resistance with Transmission Line Model (TLM) measurements on <b>wafers</b> with <b>sheet</b> resistance between 45 - 100 Ω/□.

50|$|Surface {{photovoltage}} {{measurements are}} performed {{by placing a}} <b>wafer</b> or <b>sheet</b> film of a semiconducting material on a ground electrode and positioning a kelvin probe a small distance above the sample. The surface is illuminated with light whose wavelength is scanned using a monochromator so as to vary the absorption depth of the photons. The deeper in the semiconductor that carrier generation occurs, the fewer the number of minority carriers that will reach the surface and the smaller the photovoltage. On a semiconductor whose spectral absorption coefficient is known, the minority carrier diffusion length can in principle be extracted from a measurement of photovoltage versus wavelength. The optical properties of a novel semiconduct{{or may not be}} well known or may not be homogeneous across the sample. The temperature of the semiconductor must be carefully controlled during an SPV measurement test thermal drift complicate the comparison of different samples. Typically SPV measurements are done in an AC-coupled fashion using a chopped light source rather than a vibrating Kelvin probe.|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{we use a}} facile method termed magneto-mechanical {{drawing to}} prepare microfibers. In this method, we regard the {{magnetic}} field as {{the main part of}} the spinning. Spinning solution droplet doped with magnetic nanoparticles was stretched under the magnetic force generated by a revolving permanent magnet to form a bridge and finally translated into continuous fibers. Magneto-mechanical drawing possesses lots of advantages compared with other common spinning methods. The equipment of magneto-mechanical drawing is low cost, safe, simple, and convenient without high voltage or high temperature. The resultant continuous fibers are aligned in regular order and can be easily transferred onto other substrates, like glass, silicon <b>wafer,</b> and plastic <b>sheet.</b> The resultant fibers that contain magnetic nanoparticles show excellent superparamagnetic behavior and ultrahigh stretchability and may have potential application in magnetic sensor or targeted drug delivery.|$|R

Probe contact was investigated by modeling the scrub, penetration or deformation on a bump under various conditions of wafer probe and experimentally tested on wafers on copper pillars, solder bumps of different metallurgies or <b>sheet</b> <b>wafers.</b> A single-probe contact test system was devised to study the contact behavior of a probe on a bump.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A common {{perception}} in photovoltaics {{has been that}} “first generation ” silicon wafer-based solar cells eventually would {{be replaced by a}} “second generation ” of lower cost thin-film technology, probably also involving a different semiconductor. Historically, CdS, a-Si, CuInSe 2, CdTe and, more recently, thin-film Si have been key thin-film candidates. Since mature mass-produced technologies usually evolve to the stage where costs are dominated by those of the constituent materials, be it silicon <b>wafers</b> or glass <b>sheet,</b> it is argued that photovoltaics will evolve, in its most mature form, to a “third generation ” of high-efficiency thin-film technology, with energy conversion values double or triple the 15 - 20 % range presently targeted. Tandem cells provide the best known example of such high efficiency approaches, where efficiency can be increased merely by adding more cells of different bandgap to a stack. However, several more “parallelled ” approaches are possible that offer similar efficiency to an infinite stack of tandem cells. Efficiency limits for several such options are analysed on a self-consistent basis...|$|R
40|$|Thngsten <b>sheet</b> <b>wafers</b> and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) wafers were planarized on {{chemical}} mechanical pla-narization (CMP) {{tools and}} cleaned using a mechanical wafer cleaner. Post-CMP buffing processes on the primary or sec-ondary polisher platens were investigated. Using laser scattering wafer inspection systems and {{atomic force microscopy}} we demonstrated that the buffing process strongly affects the defect density on both the TEOS and tungsten CMP wafers and the roughness power spectrum density of the tungsten CMP wafers. A "pH shock " to the TEOS wafers during oxide CMP on the primary platen resulted in a high defect density. The changes in zeta potential of the slurry particles and the TEOS surfaces during the pH shock might have caused the variations in the defect density. TEOS wafers polished with a tungsten slurry were also cleaned on a wafer cleaner with diluted HF solutions. The HF solution cleaning further enabled a reduction of the defect density. Defect densities measured on the same TEOS wafers using SFS 6220 and SFS 6420 were compared. The results indicated {{that some of the}} defect counts may be attributed to the intrusion defects and background noise from the surface roughness...|$|R
30|$|Single {{layers of}} SiNX:H thin films are first studied {{to find the}} {{appropriate}} deposition conditions and to verify the stability and reliability of the double stack antireflection coating. A p-type crystalline silicon <b>wafer</b> with a <b>sheet</b> resistance of 1 to approximately 3 Ω cm and < 100 > orientation is used as the substrate for the deposition of thin films. The wafer is doped with phosphorous in a furnace using a conventional POCl 3 diffusion source at 830 °C for 7 min. Phosphorus silicate glass [PSG] is removed by dipping the wafer in 10 % hydrofluoric acid [HF] solution for 30 s. The drive-in process is conducted for 25 min at 860 °C. Next, a second doping process at 810 °C is followed for 7 min. PSG is removed by dipping the wafer in 10 % HF solution for 30 s. SiNx deposition is conducted in the environment of N 2 at 450 °C with a radio frequency [RF] power of 180 mW/cm 2. The ratio of SiH 4 :NH 3 is varied. The flow rate of NH 3 is fixed at 200 sccm, and the flow rate of SiH 4 is varied. Double stack SiNX:H with refractive indices ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 is prepared. All the samples are co-fired in a conveyer belt furnace. The effective minority carrier lifetimes are determined with the microwave photo conductance decay technique via quasi-steady state photoconductance using the WCT- 120 silicon wafer lifetime detector (Sinton Consulting Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) before and after applying a stress. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [FT-IR] characteristics are measured using Shimadzu IR Prestige- 21 (Shimadzu Corporation, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan).|$|R
40|$|To {{reach the}} goal of grid parity for photovoltaic-generated power, the {{efficiency}} of conventional screen-printed p-type silicon solar cells should be increased without {{significant increase in the}} manufacturing cost. The semiconductor fingers (SCF) screen-printed silicon solar cell technology fabricated by laser-doping the SCF can potentially achieve this aim. Previous laser-doped SCF p-type silicon solar cell efficiencies were too low, limited by the achievable SCF doping and therefore sheet resistance levels using available laser technology. Recently, the new Spectra Physics Millennia Prime laser introduced new laser technology apparently with the potential to produce laser-doped features with sheet resistances low enough for the SCF cell. The objective of this thesis is to design and develop an n-type SCF with this laser so as to demonstrate high efficiency laser-doped SCF solar cells on p-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon <b>wafers.</b> Since the <b>sheet</b> resistance of the laser-doped SCF (lines) is important to the efficiency of the SCF solar cell, appropriate methods to measure the sheet resistance of these laser-doped lines were investigated. A method widely-used to measure the sheet resistance of a laser-doped line was demonstrated here to produce unreliable results and thus not used. Instead, a new measurement method was presented along with a new upper sheet resistance limit concept. A theory was also presented that relates these two different measurement methods, and was experimentally-supported within an error of 10 %. The Spectra Physics laser was also demonstrated to produce laserdoped lines that can be as conductive as 2 &# 937;/&# 9633;. Thus, this laser is suitable for high efficiency SCF solar cells. Beside the benefits that highly-conductive SCF can bring to a SCF cell, there are drawbacks that appear mainly in the form of SCF effective shading losses. To account for them, a model was built to simulate the efficiencies of laser-doped SCF solar cells with different SCF sheet resistance and junction depths. The cell efficiency potential of SCF laser-doped by the Spectra Physics laser was then assessed. With the most optimistic assumptions for contact resistance, and with experimentally-derived SCF sheet resistances and junction depths, the highest efficiency was predicted to be 18. 81 % and was only 1. 13 % relatively higher than that of an optimised screen-printed silicon solar cell. High SCF effective shading loss was the limiting factor. Subsequently, laser-doped SCF solar cells screen-printed with appropriate lowreactivity silver pastes were fabricated. From these cells, the contact resistance was determined to be too high and not uniform enough for high efficiency laser-doped SCF solar cells from being demonstrated in the duration of this thesis work. Plating the SCF with metal was then proposed as a solution that can overcome both challenges of high effective shading loss and low contact quality. This new metalplated SCF solar cell is known as the advanced SCF solar cell. A laser-doping and metallisation sequence in the order of screen-printing, laser-doping, and nickel/copper stack plating was analysed to be a practical sequence to fabricate the advanced SCF cell. During the development of the recipe, nickel was found to not uniformly plate across the cell and these nickel voids resulted in higher series resistance levels. A modified dopant dispense method for the laser-doping step was developed to significantly reduce these nickel voids. By applying this solution to a batch of six advanced SCF solar cells, an average batch and highest efficiency of 18. 40 % and 18. 82 % respectively were achieved on p-type Cz 1 &# 937;cm textured silicon wafers. Modelling and simulation of the advanced SCF solar cell show that this new cell design can have a direct &# 8776; 0. 7 % absolute and &# 8776; 3. 8 % relative efficiency gain over the laser-doped SCF solar cell. This is mainly due to the ability of the advanced SCF solar cell to space the screen-printed silver fingers much wider apart and to use narrower SCF. The predicted efficiency potential of the advanced SCF solar cell with a full area back surface field exceeds 20 %. Of secondary importance and it was discovered while developing techniques to minimise the contact resistance between a screen-printed metal and a high sheet resistance diffused emitter, that using dilute hydrofluoric acid to improve the contact resistance can increase the cells recombination impact and reduce its pseudo-fill factor. It was also demonstrated that by treating the cell in phosphoric acid, this impact can be significantly reduced or eliminated. Chemical analyses suggest lead to be the likely recombination source...|$|R
