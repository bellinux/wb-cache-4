50|$|Josh Ozersky of Time Magazine {{enjoyed the}} book: There {{is no more}} honest man in the media than Tony Bourdain. And that makes all the {{difference}} between him and the food-media complex that he helped create... In the present, he is angry at the abuse of food and cooking by TV food stars, those stars' frauds and follies and himself for being part of the circus. He's still mad; that's where his energy and eloquence come from. It's the best part of who he is. Happily, that anger is still white and pure after all these years; it burns away all the impurities of the food-media fog that is now his habitat. From author Austin Miller at austinraymiller.comSome of you might be familiar with his breakout hit Kitchen Confidential--the memoirs of a young angsty chef dissatisfied with the industry, the Bourdain <b>we</b> know and <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with. Ten years later and now he's back, but this time he's older and wiser. He's settled down (for a second time) with his (MMA fighter) wife and mother of his child, Ottavia Busia. He's dropped smoking, lost the leather jacket, and quit wearing his staple earring. He's even willing to soften and in some cases retract his statements about the mascots of the industry like Bobby Flay, Rachel Ray, and Mario Batali. But just because he's wiser, doesn't mean he's duller. He's still got plenty of guy talk and old man griping to do, which (if you close your eyes just for a moment) can make you feel as if your sitting on a barstool at an Elk Lodge.
