500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are, to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up {{continued}} to work, and released the album <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are in 1973. Spawning the hit single [...] "Woman from Tokyo", the album hit number 4 in the UK charts and number 15 in the US charts while achieving gold record status {{faster than any}} Deep Purple album released up to that time. But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever. Following the successes of Machine Head and Made in Japan, the addition of <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are made them the top-selling artists of 1973 in the US.|$|E

2500|$|Ian Gillan {{admitted}} in a 1984 {{interview that the}} band was pushed by management to complete the <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Think We Are album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break. The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan, followed by Glover, quitting the band after their second tour of Japan {{in the summer of}} 1973. In interviews years later, Jon Lord called the departure of Gillan and Glover while the band was at its peak [...] "the biggest shame in rock and roll; God knows what we would have become over the next three or four years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since late 2001 Karzai {{has been}} trying for peace in his country, going as far as pardoning militants that lay down weapons and join the {{rebuilding}} process. However, his offers were not accepted by the militant groups. In April 2007, Karzai acknowledged that he spoke to some militants about trying to bring peace in Afghanistan. He noted that the Afghan militants are always welcome in the country, although foreign insurgents are not. In September 2007, Karzai again offered talks with militant fighters after a security scare forced him to end a commemoration speech. Karzai left the event and was taken back to his palace, where he was due to meet visiting Latvian President Valdis Zatlers. After the meeting the pair held a joint news conference, at which Karzai called for talks with his Taliban foes. [...] "We don't have any formal negotiations with the Taliban. They don't have an address. <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> talk to?" [...] Karzai told reporters. He further stated: [...] "If I can have a place where to send somebody to talk to, an authority that publicly says it is the Taliban authority, I will do it." ...|$|E

We find strong empirical evidence that existing organic retail and wholesale markets impose considerable barriers to entry to individual organic farmers, and furthermore, the effects of transaction costs are asymmetric between the two types of farmers, those who transitioned from conventional farming and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not. Those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> are overall favored, and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not are constrained by more types of transaction costs and are constrained more severely than those <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> <b>We</b> argue that an effect policy should target to the least favored farmers by encouraging or mandating distributors and retailers have a more transparent and objective process in selecting organic suppliers, such that all farmers would have an equal opportunity to be successful in selling to indirect markets...|$|R
6000|$|All {{would have}} been irretrievably lost {{had it not been}} for the {{interposition}} of Fabius. He received intelligence of the danger at his own camp, and marched out at once with all his force, and arrived upon the ground so opportunely, and acted so efficiently, that he at once completely changed the fortune of the day. He saved Minucius and his half of the army from utter destruction. The Carthaginians retreated in their turn, Hannibal being entirely overwhelmed with disappointment and vexation at being thus deprived of his prey. History relates that Minucius had the candor and good sense, after this, to acknowledge his error, and yield to the guidance and direction of Fabius. He called his part of the army together when they reached their camp, and addressed them thus: [...] "Fellow-soldiers, I have often heard it said that the wisest men are those who possess wisdom and sagacity themselves, and, next to them, those who know how to perceive and are willing to be guided by the wisdom and sagacity of others; while they are fools who do not know how to conduct themselves, and will not be guided by those <b>who</b> <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> will not belong to this last class; and since it is proved that we are not entitled to rank with the first, let us join the second. We will march to the camp of Fabius, and join our camp with his, as before. We owe to him, and also to all his portion of the army, our eternal gratitude for the nobleness of spirit which he manifested in coming to our deliverance, when he might so justly have left us to ourselves." ...|$|E
