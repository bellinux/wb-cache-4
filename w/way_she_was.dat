Along the <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E

25|$|Rigg was {{initially}} {{unhappy with the}} <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> treated by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man.

At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, in this case On Her Majesty's Secret Service as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.|$|E
25|$|Having fought {{so hard to}} make Ismail II shah of the Safavid dynasty, Pari Khan Khanum was now {{met with}} lack of {{gratitude}} from him. The <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> treated by Ismail II made her hostile towards him, and made her prepare to exact vengeance. On 25 November 1577, Ismail II died abruptly and without any initial signs of bad health. The court doctors, who checked the corpse, surmised {{that he may have}} died from poison. The general agreement was that Pari Khan Khanum had resolved to have poisoned {{with the help of the}} mistresses of the inner harem in retaliation for his bad behaviour towards her. With Ismail II out of the way, Pari Khan Khanum regained her authority and control. Every state grandee, clan chieftains, officers and officials carried out the orders delivered by her deputies and served according to her word.|$|E

Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with his hand through Seishirō's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead. Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed the same <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> Seishirō knew this, effectively committing suicide as Fūma states Subaru's wish was dying at Seishirō's hands. After the battle, Fūma offers Subaru Seishirō's remaining intact eye, revealing that it was Seishirō's wish to erase Fūma's trace on Subaru, which Subaru accepts. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the 14th Sakurazukamori {{and one of the}} Dragons of Earth. A sidestory in the series also shows Seishiro becoming the Sakurazukamori by killing his mother who tells him he will also be killed by the person he loves.|$|E
25|$|Mary Hanford Ford (November 1, 1856 – February 2, 1937) was an American lecturer, author, art and {{literature}} critic and {{a leader in the}} women's suffrage movement. She reached early notoriety in Kansas at the age of 28 and soon left for the Chicago World's Fair. She was taken up by the society ladies of the Chicago area who, impressed with her talks on art {{and literature}} at the Fair, helped launch her on a new career, initially in Chicago and then across some States. Along the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> already published in articles and noticed in suffrage meetings. In addition to work as an art critic and speaker she wrote a number of books, most prominently a trilogy Message of the Mystics. Circa 1900-1902 Ford found the Bahá'í Faith through Sarah Farmer, Green Acre, and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and helped form the first community of Bahá'ís in Boston where Louis Bourgeois, future architect of the first Bahá'í House of Worship in the West, then joined the religion. In 1907 Ford went on Bahá'í pilgrimage, in 1910 she started writing Bahá'í books such as The Oriental Rose, and traveled with `Abdu'l-Bahá during some of his journeys in various places in Europe and then America. Ford was blamed for a fiasco among UK suffragists but it was their own violence that got them in trouble. Ford spent the years of World War I in California following the first Bahá'í International Congress at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, and then moved back to New York where she spent almost the next 20 years. Often she traveled to Europe for some months of the year and during this period introduced the religion to Ugo Giachery, later a prominent Bahá'í. Also in this period she was censored off a radio broadcast, helped develop the religion's community both in meetings she supported and literary efforts, before reducing her travels and speaking engagements in the early 1930s. She died with her daughter by her bedside in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C", {{feeling that the}} [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the psychic {{photographs}} were ruined by [...] "boilerplate Scully-in-distress shtick". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more positive, grading it as a [...] "B+". He felt that its [...] "greatest virtue" [...] was being terrifying and that it worked for being an [...] "urban fairytale". However, he also criticized it for putting Scully in danger. Sarah Stegall awarded the episode four stars out of five, praising the writing by Gilligan, who she commented was [...] "genius for tight confrontation scenes", complimenting the atmosphere and presentation of the episode. She criticized the final scene featuring Scully tied up with duct-tape, commenting that the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> loosely tied up was unrealistic. The fact that the episode's [...] "absurd concept" [...] was simply a [...] "side-story" [...] also drew positive attention, summarizing her review with, [...] "otherwise a creepy and engaging detective story".|$|E

Hill later said that she and Marley [...] "have had long periods of separation over the years".

After leading {{for most of the}} <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> headed in the final furlong and beaten a neck by Stellar Wind with the pair finishing more than eleven lengths clear of the other three runners. On November 4, in what was scheduled to be her final racecourse appearance before her retirement, Beholder made her first appearance in the Breeders' Cup since 2013 when she once again contested the Distaff at Santa Anita. Stellar Wind was again challenging, but the odds-on favorite was the undefeated three-year-old Songbird. Beholder, coming off three losses, was third in the betting odds. From the outside post position of the eight-horse field, Beholder tracked the leaders before moving alongside Songbird on the final turn. The pair engaged in a prolonged struggle in the straight before Beholder prevailed by a scant nose in a photo-finish. Stevens described the race by saying, [...] "I've been in battles before, but never the length of the stretch [...] [...] [...] definitely {{a quarter of a mile}} of just a street fight."

500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, there was no <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accuracy}} of Boys Don't Cry was disputed by real-life {{people involved in}} the murder.

Tisdel disliked the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> portrayed in the film, and called the film the [...] "second murder of Brandon Teena". Before the film's theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film's producers, claiming that the film depicted her as [...] "lazy, white trash and a skanky snake" [...] and that her family and friends had come to see her as [...] "a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder". [...] Tisdel said the film falsely portrayed her continuing her relationship with Teena after she discovered he was transgender. Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, [...] "There's none of it that's right. It was just weird."
