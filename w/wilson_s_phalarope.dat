40|$|Only {{once before}} has a nesting record of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Phalarope</b> (Phalaropus tricolor) been {{reported}} in Lancaster County. This report is in The Nebraska Bird Review, December 1985. Employees of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission discovered two fledglings at a site in the northeast {{part of the county}} at 98 th and Ashland Road. The two fledglings were found in a wet meadow. They were accompanied by two male and one female phalaropes. The sighting was made on 13 June 1985. On 7 June 1991 I visited Arbor Lake, a recently purchased salt marsh about one mile north of Interstate 80 along North 27 th Street. This site is currently being managed by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission for the city of Lincoln. My reason for visiting the site was {{to see what kind of}} birds utilized the area. In the area that day I saw a female Orchard Oriole building a nest in an American elm tree along the west bank of Little Salt Creek as it parallels North 27 th Street for part of the creek 2 ̆ 7 s reach to the north. In the same area I found a male and female Blue Grosbeak. Not too far to the north, Arbor Lake spread itself over the landscape attracting the following birds: 4 Killdeer, 1 Spotted Sandpiper, 3 male Blue-winged Teals, 2 female and 1 male Mallards, 3 Semipalmated Sandpipers, 4 White-rumped Sandpipers, about 40 Red-winged Blackbirds, 1 male WIlson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Phalarope,</b> and a number of Bank Swallows flying low over the marsh. The male phalarope came flying toward me from afar as I advanced eastward through the transition zone of the marsh. The lone male tries to lead me from the area with an aerial distraction display. I made no attempt to find the nesting site, but worked my way into the marsh to see the shorebirds farther to the east using a tripod-held spotting scope...|$|R
40|$|This was an {{interesting}} spring season, with something for everyone. Interesting data in terms of numbers are being produced by the North American Migration Count (NAMC), especially this spring in Sarpy County; examples are 499 Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrushes, 76 Gray-cheeked Thrushes, and 118 Black-and-white Warblers, and others. Some species appeared in large numbers such as 5, 000 Western Grebes, 16 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 10, 000 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Phalaropes,</b> 300 each of Black-bellied Plover and Sanderling, 54 Whimbrels, and two flocks of over 100 Great-tailed Grackles. Some interesting early and late dates {{are included in the}} species accounts, but several observers noted unexpected species such as Indigo Bunting and Rose-breasted Grosbeak, at feeders; this may have been due to-the cold, wet spring keeping insect numbers at a low level. It may have also brought Painted Buntings to our notice at feeders...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} this report {{is the fact that}} 94 observers provided data! E-mail has certainly provided a simple way to report sightings with ease, obviating for many the tedium of compiling a magnum opus four times a year (although the ultra-dedicated Harding and Randolph still filed their standard 40 -pager!). Interesting banding information was, provided for Red-eyed Vireo, Gray Catbird, and Pine Siskin by Ruth Green. The characteristics of the subspecies of Pine Siskin are not well-known anywhere, let alone in Nebraska. Waterfowl and raptors had few significant sightings, although harriers were noted nesting at a couple of locations south of the Platte River. Shorebirds were interesting; Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s 6 th Ruff was the only real rarity, but usually uncommon species in high numbers included Marbled Godwit, Ruddy Turnstone, Sanderling, and Dunlin. Very early were Pectoral Sandpiper, Long-billed Dowitcher, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Phalarope,</b> the latter by five days...|$|R
