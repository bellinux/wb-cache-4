The {{systems of}} DLC film/ 304 {{stainless}} steel were separately treated with cryogenic treatment,annealing treatment and composite treatment of cryogenic+annealing to {{study the effects of}} different treatments on friction and <b>wear</b> <b>property</b> of DLC film/ {{304 stainless steel}},mainly from the film’s hardness,fracture toughness and surface roughness. The results show that the friction and <b>wear</b> <b>property</b> of DLC film/ 304 stainless steel is improved in different degrees by the three kinds of treatment,single cryogenic treatment performs best. It is because that three kinds of treatment all can improve the fracture toughness of DLC film and reduce DLC film’s surface roughness,but only single cryogenic treatment doesn’t reduce film’s hardness and makes film get the best lubricity and highest hardness-to-elasticity ratio.

40|$|Abstract. Al alloy {{reinforced}} with SiCp (size: 70 - 220 µm) was fabricated by pressureless-infiltration. Its <b>wear</b> resistant <b>property</b> was investigated under different heat-treatment conditions, and morphology of worn surface was examined. The {{results showed that}} the composite was integrated, uniform and compact, and its <b>wear</b> resistant <b>property</b> was better than that of the unreinforced matrix alloy. It was indicated that some rigid SiCp in the abraded surface of the composite could support part of loads and replace matrix to wear-tear, which improved the <b>wear</b> resistant <b>property.</b> Compared to annealing, solution aging strengthens Al alloy matrix and cohesion with SiCp, and the <b>wear</b> resistant <b>property</b> of composites was better. Combining interface is also an important factor which influences on <b>wear</b> resistant <b>property.</b> During the <b>wear</b> test, the smaller SiCp size, the more interfaces, there are more SiCp falling off because of loosening combining interface, which results in more wear-tearing value. The wear rate of composite increases with decreasing SiCp size, thus, the composite with larger SiCp has better wear-resistant property than that with smaller SiCp. At last, the wear mechanism of the composite was also studied, and it showed that abrasive wear dominated in the abrasion process...|$|R
