[...] Despite criticism that he appeared to move before the start, a violation of the rules, the race start was validated by the officials. [...] Afterward, Ohno said, [...] "I was in the moment at the time. I thought I timed the start just perfect. The starter had been pretty quick all day, so that's why there were so many false starts at the beginning. But that <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> for me." ...|$|E

We wanted it {{to look like a}} party scene, but not in a typical club, and it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> fun.

During the Vancouver stop on her Rebel Heart Tour in 2015, Madonna again performed an acoustic {{rendition of the}} song, dedicating it to a [...] "special guest" [...] in the audience, which was assumed by media to be her ex-husband Sean Penn, {{who was in the}} audience.

In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good,</b> we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E

Brad Trechak of the TV Squad said of {{the episode}}: [...] "In the end, the episode <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> {{at the beginning and}} the ending, but the middle kind of dragged." [...] Eric Hochburger of TV Fanatic criticized the Mike Scioscia cameo, although he said that [...] "hile this week's installment will never replace our favorite Simpsons baseball episode, [...] "Homer at the Bat," [...] there [...] certainly plenty of great jokes and a strong enough story with heart to keep us entertained." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club compared the episode favorably to [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] although he also criticized the Scioscia cameo, calling it [...] "awkward". In conclusion he gave the episode an A-, the best grade of the night.|$|E

500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good.</b> The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn't want to play around too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could let go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E
500|$|The band found Danesmoate {{to have a}} very {{creative}} atmosphere, but according to the Edge, they [...] "just couldn't settle in". The large drawing room, with a tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an [...] "ear-splitting" [...] drum sound that caused issues for the group. Lanois had a higher opinion of the house, saying: [...] "It was loud, but it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot." [...] According to him, [...] "the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record—we got a lot of the drums done in there." [...] He thought that the house sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the drawing room's [...] "low mid-range ... where the music lives", a property that he believes was {{a major factor in the}} success of The Joshua Tree.|$|E

Connie Talbot's Christmas Album contains [...] "a mix of classics and modern Christmas tunes", and was produced by Simon Hill and Rob May, who produced her first album, Over the Rainbow. Big band arrangements on the album included music from Laurence Cottle Big Band, while the orchestral sections of the more traditional songs were performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra. The duet on [...] "When a Child Is Born" [...] was performed by Talbot and Ginger Kwan. Describing the recording of the album, Talbot said [...] "I really liked it. I liked all the songs they picked and everything. It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> and enjoyable." [...] Five tracks ("Let it Snow!", [...] "Rocking Around the Christmas Tree", [...] "Jingle Bell Rock", [...] "Santa Clause Is Coming to Town" [...] and [...] "Frosty the Snowman") were recorded in the style of a big band, while the remainder were recorded in a [...] "more traditional" [...] style.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good.</b> So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

One of the works he selected was Late Spring, with the following comment: [...] " [...] characteristic camera work was imitated by many directors abroads [...] as well, i.e., many people saw and see Mr. Ozu’s movies, right?
