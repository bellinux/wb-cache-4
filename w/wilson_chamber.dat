5000|$|The {{history of}} nuclear {{cardiology}} began in 1927 when Dr. Herrmann Blumgart developed {{the first method}} for measuring cardiac strength by injecting subjects with a radioactive compound known as Radium C (Bi214) [...] The substance was injected into the venous system and traveled through the right heart into the lungs, then into the left heart {{and out into the}} arterial system where it was then detected through a <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber.</b> The <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber</b> represented a primitive scintillation counter which could measure radioactivity. Measured over time, this sequential acquisition of radioactivity produced what was known as [...] "circulation time". The longer the [...] "circulation time", the weaker the heart. Blumgart's emphasis was twofold. First, radioactive substances could be used to determine cardiac physiology (function) and should be done so with the least amount of radioactivity necessary to do so. Secondly, to accomplish this task, one needs to obtain multiple counts over time.|$|E

He went to study physics at the University of Milan, and then in February 1938, went to the Sapienza University of Rome on the {{invitation}} of Edoardo Amaldi. There he met physicists Enrico Fermi, and Gilberto Bernardini. With Fermi, he built a <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber</b> to study the disintegration of mesons. In August of that year, Cocconi laid the foundation of cosmic ray research in Milan. While at Milan, Cocconi supervised Vanna Tongiorgi, who picked cosmic rays as her thesis' subject, and later married her in 1945.|$|E

She decided to stay in France permanently in 1955, resigning from her post at Ochanomizu. At the CNRS, she began research into beta decay using a <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber,</b> and published a 1954 article warning {{of the dangers of}} hydrogen-bomb testing at Bikini Atoll. She was promoted to maître de recherche (chief researcher) at CNRS in 1957. Her research shifted into nuclear reactions using synchrocyclotrons around 1960, and in 1962 she received a doctorate in science from Kyoto University for her thesis, [...] "Étude du type d’invariant de l’interaction Gamow-Teller en désintégration β− de 6He" [...] (Form of Gamow-Teller invariant interaction on beta decay of 6He).|$|E

Measurements have been made on 95 stars believed to be examples of the C 12 (n, n 3 a) reaction. An analysis of the angles between the emergent and incident neutron directions and their variations with {{the energy of the}} star gives strong evidence that this reaction proceeds without the formation of C 13 as a compound nucleus.

40|$|Out of a {{group of}} 1300 {{photographs}} of cosmic-ray tracks in a vertical <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber</b> 15 tracks were of positive particles which could not have a mass as great as that of the proton. From an examination of the energy-loss and ionization produced it is concluded that the charge is less than twice, and is probably exactly equal to, that of the proton. If these particles carry unit positive charge the curvatures and ionizations produced require the mass to be less than twenty times the electron mass. These particles will be called positrons. Because they occur in groups associated with other tracks it is concluded that they must be secondary particles ejected from atomic nuclei...|$|E
40|$|A {{report of}} the direct {{observation}} of positrons ejected from lead by hard gamma-rays has been published. (1) A source of radiothorium with its disintegration products was used. To obtain a well-defined beam the gamma-rays were collimated {{by allowing them to}} pass through a half-inch hole in a series of lead blocks totaling 18 inches in length. That the beam actually was well defined is shown by {{the fact that most of}} the observed tracks appeared to originate within a rather narrow region, about 3 cm wide. In this series of photographs the beam passed vertically downward through the side wall of a <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber</b> across which were placed a 2 mm lead sheet, and below this a 0. 5 mm sheet of aluminum. A magnetic field of 430 gauss normal to the face of the chamber and uniform to within 10 percent was used...|$|E

40|$|Antimatter, already conjectured by A. Schuster in 1898, was {{actually}} predicted by P. A. M. Dirac {{in the late}} 19 -twenties in the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Its existence was subsequently confirmed via the <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber</b> and became an established part of theoretical physics. Dirac soon discovered that particles with negative energy do not behave in a physically conventional manner, and he therefore developed his "hole theory". This restricted the study of antimatter to the sole level of second quantization. As a result antimatter created a scientific imbalance, because matter was treated {{at all levels of}} study, while antimatter was treated only at the level of second quantization. In search of a new mathematics for the resolution of this imbalance the author conceived what we know today as Santilli’s isodual mathematics, which permitted the construction of isodual classical mechanics, isodual quantization and isodual quantum mechanics. The scope of this monograph is to show that our classical, quantum and cosmological knowledge of antimatter is at its beginning with much yet to be discovered, and that a commitment to antimatter by experimentalists will be invaluable to antimatter science...|$|E
40|$|The {{coming into}} {{light of the}} neutron is discussed. It is remarked that some {{experiments}} had already suggested that the penetrating radiation from beryllium had an electromagnetic component, before Joliot-Curies suggested the beryllium radiation consisted of high-energy gamma rays. Joliot-Curies' idea also relied on the many Compton electron tracks in the <b>Wilson</b> <b>chamber.</b> In 1920, both Harkins and Rutherford foresaw {{the existence of a}} particle of mass 1 and zero charge, consisting of one proton and one electron, though they did not give any name to it. In 1932, the neutron was finally observed by Chadwick. However, the question whether considering the neutron as a fundamental or a compound particle still bothered the physicists and Chadwick himself for more than one year. Instead, as soon as Majorana heard about Joliot-Curies' experiments he guessed the existence of a "neutral proton. " In 1933 he published some "corrections" to Heisenberg's theory. A very simple analysis shows that Heisenberg's original version of exchange interactions and Majorana's version clearly reflect, respectively, that the nucleus contained "electrons" and that the nucleus was free from electrons. The emission of electrons from the nucleus still needed to be accounted for. Fermi's theory of beta-decay settled the question. Thanks to exchange interactions and beta-decay theory, quantum mechanics could now be applied to the nucleus, which could be considered free from electrons. Also the neutron could be considered free from electrons, and treated as a fundamental particle. Comment: In Italian, 15 page...|$|E
