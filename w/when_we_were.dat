He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> young.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Fightstar {{announced}} {{that they were going}} on hiatus to focus on separate projects. Westaway and Haigh worked on Gunship, a synthwave group devoted to film music, and completed production of the score to Grzegorz Jonkajtys and Bastiaan Koch's short film, The 3rd Letter, with Audrey Riley. The film received several awards from film festivals worldwide. Simpson began work on solo material. In December 2010 he released an EP entitled <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> Lions through PledgeMusic, an organisation which helps artists raise money to record music from fans. His debut album, Young Pilgrim, was released in August 2011. Simpson's solo work differed from his previous efforts, featuring a sound described as closer to folk music than to rock or pop.|$|E

5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.|$|E

When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E
25|$|Which was, you know, {{that was}} cool – {{somebody}} had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up.

And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for}} a raise... I did talk to him about it, but he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know. So, I thought, 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E
25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E
