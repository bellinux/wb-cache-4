Some of the casement windows feature original art glass with simple geometric designs. The art glass, {{which is one of}} Wright's earliest completely original designs of the type, features three vertical lines with simple colored borders. When compared with the art glass on the Isidore Heller House, designed the same year, the Furbeck glass is uninteresting and may represent the start of Wright's glass border art work. Beneath the first and second floor windows a continuous stone sill course wraps around the house.|$|E

The doors measure [...] and have wooden doors with spread fan carvings on the {{threshold}} above.

These windows measure [...] As with the doors, the threshold above the windows is decorated with spread fan carvings. The walls are made of concrete covered in ceramic, while the floor is made of white tiles with a flower motif.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier {{examples}} of the component pieces existed, as is clear from documentary records and stray surviving pieces, but the toilet service as a large matching set of pieces seems to become common among the rich in the 17th century, and especially the France of Louis XIV. [...] Sets of ewers and basins such as the Lomellini Ewer and Basin were a staple of display plate well before this, but the many paintings of the Toilet of Venus, for example by Rubens, show that until about 1650 even goddesses used mirrors <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames.</b> [...] Although many were made, very few Louis XIV toilet services survive, and these are all ones that left France quickly, and escaped the very effective drives {{at the end of}} Louis's reign to get the nobility to donate their plate {{to help pay for the}} ruinous Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. [...] Exiled Huguenot silversmiths helped to spread French styles in England and elsewhere. [...] Once established, the characteristic types of pieces changed little, but their style followed general fashions in the decorative arts.|$|E

5000|$|The Board's {{fleet of}} A.E.C. [...] "Q"s was {{delivered}} in two stages. The first batch were {{assembled in the}} Board's workshops from four chassis of the initial order with A.E.C. and finished <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>framing</b> and aluminium panelling.

5000|$|The Board's {{first order}} for Ford V8 chassis from Canada was for 20 units, {{of which it}} took {{delivery}} of 10 and then sold 3 to Dunedin City Tramway.

2500|$|The {{other six}} chassis {{from the initial}} order placed with A.E.C. were for Regal-class buses, which, as with the [...] "Q"s, were also {{assembled}} in the Board's workshops <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>framing</b> and aluminium panelling. The design of the Regals was in the half-cab style, in which the driver was isolated from the passengers in a small compartment {{to the right of}} the centrally mounted engine at the front of the vehicle. This first batch of Regals commenced their duties on 2 November 1936 as numbers 229–234.|$|R
50|$|Initially six trucks <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames</b> were used, {{which could}} {{transport}} up to 30 m long logs {{or up to}} four cubic metres of cut logs. 1887 the number of trucks was increased to 16. Empty trucks were hauled by horses from the logging siding to the forester's house. After loading they descended by gravity within 30 min to the valley controlled by a brake operator.|$|E
50|$|General models, {{installed}} <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames</b> indicating lesser reinforcements, {{are used}} for applications involving materials with distinct difference in sizes. An example {{for this is the}} removal of impurities from wood chips for biomass fuel production. In this case, the desired product will be discharged at the coarsest screen, leaving smaller impurities to sink to the bottom frames. These models are selected for more economical purposes and are less common.|$|E

50|$|Between 1918 and 1939 {{aircraft}} technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames,</b> canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines. Biplanes {{continued to}} be the mainstay of air forces {{around the world and}} were used extensively in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War. Most industrial countries also created air forces separate from the army and navy. However, by 1939 military biplanes {{were in the process of}} being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with stressed skins and liquid-cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled; ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the earliest models which had wings and tails <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames,</b> M20s are entirely constructed of metal. All are low-wing aircraft, and the wing skin is aluminum. Slotted flaps cover 70% of the trailing edge. Earlier models use a hydraulic hand pump to extend the flaps, while later models have electrically operated flaps. The forward fuselage has a steel tube cabin structure covered in aluminum skin; the aft portion of the fuselage is of semi-monocoque design. In many places on the skin of the airplane, flush-mounted rivets are used to reduce drag.|$|E

However, in 1939, Konergino was split off from the Nutepelmen Soviet and established as its own kholkoz. Following this establishment, a new warehouse was built along <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> and stone houses. In 1953, a hospital was constructed in the village along with a boarding school, with a kindergarten being added two years later. In 1984 a two-storey secondary school was completed.|$|R

5000|$|Early Lakeland settler John T. Cyphers read {{an article}} in an 1855 edition of the St. Paul Pioneer Press {{suggesting}} a concrete mixture as a building material. This mixture, known {{at the time as}} [...] "grout", comprised lime, sand, mud, and gravel. In 1858 Cyphers began constructing a house for himself using this method. [...] He formed the core of the walls with small, undressed boulders. [...] He outlined the two-foot-thick walls <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames</b> and poured in the grout. [...] The principle walls were all built this way, but above the first story the gables, roof, and dormers are all wood.|$|E
5000|$|The depot is a one-story frame {{structure}} measuring 30 ft by 82 ft, and clad in weatherboard and bead board. It was a [...] "combination depot," [...] meaning it housed both passengers and freight (stations for larger cities often had separate depots for passengers and freight). The southern {{half of the}} building's roof is hipped, and includes south-facing and west-facing dormers. Most of the windows are four-over-four double-hung sash windows <b>with</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>frames,</b> the exception being a clerestory window on the north wall. The depot retains its original wooden doors. Rolling track doors are located {{on the east side}} of the building.|$|E

On both sides of the entrance are the circular window while the sides of the gable roof are ornamented with clay decorations. Bay windows are installed at offices and the dormitory {{on both sides of the}} traverse to allow more daylight inside. The structure at the rare uses the Japanese-style dormitory, in which the foundation is elevated and a large siding door is installed on the exterior rear side. The building is currently used as the visitor center for the cultural and creative center.|$|R
