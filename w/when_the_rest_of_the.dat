5|$|In 1962, the {{northern}} and eastern freeway bypass of Ann Arbor was completed. At that time, the former routing of US23 through downtown and a section of freeway north of the Huron River was redesignated as Bus. US23. Two years later, M-14 was rerouted to follow the US23 freeway around {{the north side of}} Ann Arbor. It overlapped the business loop from {{the northern}} end of its freeway segment to Main Street and along Main Street into downtown. The next year, in 1965, this overlap was shortened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-14 freeway westward from Main Street to I-94 was completed.|$|E

Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E

The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste. Marie. The former routing was given the M-121 designation, and later M-4.|$|E

The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties {{in the early days}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.|$|E

D'Ambrosio held off pressure from Vergne for second place until he was passed on the 43rd lap and di Grassi remained the leader {{for the rest of the}} race after conserving electrical energy to win.

The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to {{come and talk to}} him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police finally break in, they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane.

When Call's identity as an Auton is revealed, DiStephano summarizes their history as second-generation synthetics created by other synthetics as sleeper agents. After DiStephano and the group board the Betty, the ship's cargo hatch is stuck open; when Call tries to fix it, she is confronted by the stowaway Newborn. DiStephano checks on her and is caught by the Newborn, which crushes his skull.|$|E

Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1919, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{state highway}} system was first signed, M-61 ran between M-18 at Gladwin to M-30 at White Star. A decade later in 1929, M-61 was {{extended}} south to Winegars along M-30 and then northeasterly zig-zagging through Highwood and Bentley to Standish. This eastern extension was straightened in 1932, bypassing the route south through Winegars and Bentley {{to use a}} direct course between White Star and Standish. At the same time, a second, discontinuous section of M-61 was created when {{a section of the}} contemporary M-63 was redesignated M-61 between US131 at Tustin and M-115 near Marion. At the same time, additional county roads were upgraded to state highways, extending the western M-61 to US127 in Harrison. The gap between Harrison and Gladwin was eliminated in 1940 when the roadway was built between the two towns. At the end of the 1950s, M-61's designation was removed between M-115 and US131. The western end was realigned in 1974 to bypass Marion, shortening the route of M-61.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|Vital to the Norwegian {{effort to}} try to halt the German advance was {{assistance}} from the Allies, which Koht requested {{in the early hours of}} 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government fled from Molde to Tromsø, landing on 1 May, Koht and Ljungberg (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser HMS Glasgow to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives (Lord Halifax, Chamberlain and Admiral Philips) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met Reynaud, Gamelin and Daladier in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May. The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front. These plans were however abandoned by the Allies on 24 May 1940, following the worsening situation for the Allies in France, and an evacuation decided. Koht was informed by British Minister to Norway Sir Cecil Dormer on 1 June that the Allied Forces had decided to retreat from Norway, owing to the difficult situation at the Western Front.|$|E
