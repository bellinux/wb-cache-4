50|$|Qikiqtarjuaq is {{a popular}} stop for pilots who fly smaller {{aircraft}} to and from Europe. The airport has a 3,800 foot by 100 foot gravel runway that is <b>well</b> <b>compacted,</b> <b>well</b> cared for, cleared of snow daily, and lit. Qikiqtarjuaq is considerably closer to Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland than Iqaluit (CYFB). The instrument approach minima for the NDB approach at CYVM is relatively high (2,000 feet barometric, 1,982 AGL) due to high terrain surrounding the airport. An airport advisory service (Broughton Radio, a CARS) provides assistance to pilots during normal business hours, and provides weather observation services. An automatic weather observation service (AWOS) operates when Broughton Radio is unattended. The fuel supplier at the airport can assist with all ground handling arrangements, including transportation, parking, de-icing, and accommodations.|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to affect any transportation network that comprises embankments and cuttings built with soil material in an unsaturated state that is exposed to the climate. The BIONICS project (BIOlogical and eNgineering Impacts of Climate change on Slopes) aims to investigate how climate change will affect the serviceability and safety of earth structures. Part of the BIONICS project was to build a full-scale highly instrumented embankment combined with an automated climate control system. Studies on the fill material used {{in the construction of the}} BIONICS embankment were carried out to understand the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the material, which is a sandy clay of medium plasticity. This involved the determination of the soil water retention behaviour and the mechanical behaviour under unsaturated conditions. Soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined by a series of tests performed on compacted samples comprising various techniques (filter paper, psychrometer, high capacity suction probe and pressure plate). Total and matric suction SWRC following primary drying paths from 25 % of water content were determined. In addition, a series of tests with the filter paper on samples at lower water contents (15 %, 20 % and 22 %) was also performed. The SWRC following drying paths showed behavior similar to scanning curves intercepting the primary curve around 3000 kPa (11 % water content). However, SWRCs that followed wetting paths showed atypical behaviour by intercepting the primary drying curve. For the investigation of the mechanical behaviour a series of constant water content triaxial tests were carried out in double cell triaxial cells on as-compacted samples, and also samples wetted and dried from as-compacted conditions of 15 %, 20 % and 22 %. A test series of samples tested in a saturated state was also performed to provide a reference state for the unsaturated tests. The unsaturated test series showed that the slope of the critical state line (CSL) in deviatoric stress space (M) was found to be similar for all water contents. The slope of the CSL in ν-ln(p-uw) space (λ) was found to be similar for all water contents, however the CSL shifted position due to variation in the intercept, Γ. Since specimens were at high degrees of saturation, calculations based on effective stress showed a reasonable interpretation of the data. However, a better agreement was achieved using the Bishop’s average stress assumption. A new field measurement system to continuously measure pore water pressure at different depths using high capacity suction probes has been developed. This system was installed at the BIONICS embankment in two different panels (<b>well</b> and poorly <b>compacted).</b> In the <b>well</b> <b>compacted</b> panel pore water pressure behaviour had the tendency to increase with depth, always recording values that were slightly negative at shallower depths and positive at greater depths, showing profiles roughly parallel to the hydrostatic line suggesting that the material was close to saturation. In the poorly compacted panel the behaviour was found to be more variable showing abrupt reactions from the probes to weather events. The differences in behaviour between the <b>well</b> <b>compacted</b> and poorly compacted panels could be related to the laboratory investigations. The <b>well</b> <b>compacted</b> panel was more homogeneous and less permeable (10 - 11 m/s). The poorly compacted panel was more heterogenic, more permeable and hence, during monitoring, showed more dramatic changes in pore pressure compared to the <b>well</b> <b>compacted</b> panel.

30|$|Permeability of {{the waste}} {{controls}} the water table, draw-down curve, migration of contaminants out {{of the waste}} piles, and oxidation rates. The embankment slopes that are generally not as <b>well</b> <b>compacted</b> have a much higher air and water permeability and {{this can lead to}} increased pyrite weathering and sulfate discharge. These discharges, rich in ferric iron (powerful oxidant) typically seep into FCPW or slurry disposal areas and can accelerate slurry oxidation and acidification at least in areas adjacent to the slopes. Since the water holding capacity of compacted CCPW is low, and the replaced soils are likely to be affected by upwardly migrating salts, the vegetation after reclamation can become stressed and over the long-term degraded.|$|R

A CBR of 3 equates to tilled farmland, a CBR of 4.75 equates to turf or moist clay, while moist sand may have a CBR of 10. High quality crushed rock has a CBR over 80.
