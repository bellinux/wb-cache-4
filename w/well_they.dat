5|$|In the 1968–69 season, third-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21goals {{to set an}} NHL {{record for}} goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight {{consecutive}} Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126points. A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive part of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how <b>well</b> <b>they</b> created goals in addition to how <b>well</b> <b>they</b> prevented them. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career; he played 12seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978.

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as <b>well.</b> <b>They</b> are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song.

5|$|Being herbivores, {{blackbuck}} graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as <b>well.</b> <b>They</b> prefer sedges, fall witchgrass, mesquite, {{and live}} oak. They have occasionally been observed browsing on acacia {{trees in the}} Cholistan Desert. Oats and berseem {{were found to be}} palatable and nutritious to captive populations in a study. A study in the Velavadar Black Buck Sanctuary (Gujarat, India) showed that Dichanthium annulatum comprised 35 percent of their diet. Digestion of nutrients, especially crude proteins, was poor in summer, but more efficient in the rainy and winter seasons. Consequently crude protein intake in summer was very low, even below the recommended value. Blackbuck had a lower food consumption in summer. The fruits of Prosopis juliflora are often eaten, and blackbuck {{may play a role in}} their dispersal. Prosopis becomes a significant food item if grasses are scarce. Water is a daily requirement of the blackbuck.|$|E
