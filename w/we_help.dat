[...] In 1968 Miss Whitlam wrote: 'Ours is a world where each year we become more conscious of how quickly and radically our environment is changing. [...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here <b>we</b> <b>help</b> the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E

Aziz Dweik, [...] "a leading Hamas lawmaker in the West Bank", said [...] "When we use violence, <b>we</b> <b>help</b> Israel win international support. The Gaza flotilla has done more for Gaza than 10,000 rockets." ...|$|E

In , Lorde states, [...] "Poetry is the way <b>we</b> <b>help</b> give name to the nameless {{so it can be}} thought…As they become known to and accepted by us, our feelings and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring ideas." [...] Sister Outsider also elaborates Lorde's challenge to European-American traditions.|$|E

They are ordinary civilians who have risen against arbitrariness toward Muslims in those republics. No matter how hard {{we try to make}} them refrain from combat operations, we will not succeed. They are our brothers in faith and therefore <b>we</b> <b>help</b> them – we share our experience and direct them. God willing, we are planning to send our experienced instructors there this year. We will not leave them on their own. It is our duty to help them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Surbaugh, BSA Chief Scout Executive said [...] "This {{decision}} {{is true to}} the BSA’s mission and core values outlined in the Scout Oath and Law. The values of Scouting – trustworthy, loyal, helpful, kind, brave and reverent, for example – are important for both young men and women.” “We believe {{it is critical to}} evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.

2500|$|The next day, Wild {{wrote to}} David Hill, the chief {{executive}} of State Rail Authority (SRA): [...] he described his XPT experience and asked, [...] "Can <b>we</b> <b>help</b> in any way to improve things?". [...] Then at a meeting Hill arranged in February 1984, having researched by then the French and Japanese high-speed rail systems (of which he had been only distantly aware when he had taken his journey), Wild and two colleagues discussed the potential for much higher speeds with SRA executives. But despite the cordiality, it became apparent that such a project was unlikely to go far under the umbrella of the SRA. The executives said [...] "country trains" [...] were simply the lowest of their priorities.|$|E
2500|$|..... we are, first, {{commanded}} {{to survive}} as Jews, lest the Jewish people perish. We are commanded, secondly, to remember in our very guts and bones the martyrs of the Holocaust, lest their memory perish. We are forbidden, thirdly, to deny or despair of God, however much {{we may have to}} contend with him or with belief in him, lest Judaism perish. We are forbidden, finally, to despair of the world as the place which is to become the kingdom of God, lest <b>we</b> <b>help</b> make it a meaningless place in which God is dead or irrelevant and everything is permitted. To abandon any of these imperatives, in response to Hitler's victory at Auschwitz, would be to hand him yet other, posthumous victories.|$|E

He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. The other Wu officers said, [...] "General Sun is a relative of our lord. He's under siege, so shouldn't <b>we</b> <b>help</b> him?" [...] Lu Xun replied, [...] "He {{has the support of}} his men, his base is well defended, and he has sufficient supplies. There's nothing to worry about. When my plans are set in motion, even if we don't go to his aid, the siege on him will automatically be lifted." [...] After the Wu victory, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and said, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me.
