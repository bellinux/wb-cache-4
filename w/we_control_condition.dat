Furthermore, we also include a counter-based scheduling module as the core scheduling mechanism which adaptively adjusts the actual QoS levels assigned to requests. Our theoretical analysis of the two enhanced algorithms, called QEDF and QRM, shows that the QRM algorithm is more robust than the QEDF algorithm for different workload and utilization conditions. We also propose to use a new metric called meta-QoS to quantify the overall performance of a packet scheduler given a set of simultaneous requests. In our experiments, {{we find that the}} QRM algorithm can sustain a rather stable level of meta-QoS even when the workload and utilization levels are increased. On the other hand, the QEDF algorithm is found to be less desirable for a high level of utilization and a large number of requests. ...|$|R

Subjects had to perform a memorized sequence of three saccades in darkness, after a triple-step stimulus of successively flashed laser targets. To assess the differential contribution of saccadic subfunctions, <b>we</b> applied several <b>control</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as central fixation with or without triple-step visual stimulation, self-paced saccades in darkness, visually guided saccades and single memory-guided saccades. Triple-step saccades strongly activated the regions of the frontal eye fields, the adjacent ventral premotor cortex, the supplementary eye fields, the anterior cingulate cortex and several posterior parietal foci in the superior parietal lobule, the precuneus, and the middle and posterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus, the probable location of the human parietal eye field. Comparison with the <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> showed that the right intraparietal sulcus and parts of the frontal and supplementary eye fields are more involved in the execution of triple-step saccades than in the other saccade tasks. In accordance with evidence from clinical lesion studies, we propose that the supplementary eye field essentially controls the triggering of memorized saccadic sequences, whereas activation near the middle portion of the right intraparietal sulcus appears to reflect the necessary spatial computations, including the use of extraretinal information (efference copy) about a saccadic eye displacement for updating the spatial representation of the second or third target of the triple-step sequence...|$|R

Their promoter methylation profile was also evaluated. Drug-related genes were upregulated. Cisplatin resistance matched with high levels of BRCA 1 and ERCC 1 in both cell lines; docetaxel sensitivity of CAEP cells was associated to levels of TUBB 3 lower than RAL cells. Although CAEP cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine, both cell lines showed high levels of RRM 1. Stemness-related genes were downregulated in the <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> but became upregulated in docetaxel-resistant cells, indicating the selection of a population with stemness features.

This paper presents techniques for reducing such bleed-through distortion using techniques of digital image processing. Both sides of the document are scanned, maintaining full spatial and amplitude resolution (8 bits/sample). The bleedthrough is reduced by processing both sides of the document simultaneously. First the verso side is flipped from left to right, and then the recto and flipped verso images are registered. This registration is necessary since it is impossible to perfectly align the front and back when scanning the document, and the scanner may not be perfectly uniform. We used a six-parameter affine transformation to register the two sides, determining the parameters using an optimization method. Once the two sides have been registered, areas consisting primarily of bleed-through are identified and replaced by the background color or intensity.

40|$|A {{transformation}} unit is a structuring {{principle for}} composing graph transformation systems from small units. One {{of the basic}} components of a transformation unit is its <b>control</b> <b>condition</b> which allows to restrict the non-determinism of graph transformation. The concept of transformation units is generic {{in the sense that}} each formalism which specifies a binary relation on graphs {{can be used as a}} <b>control</b> <b>condition.</b> This paper discusses a selection of concrete classes of <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> which seem to provide reasonable expressive power for specifying and programming with transformation units. These include regular expressions, once, as-long-as-possible, priorities, and conditionals; some of them were already used in an ad hoc manner in earlier papers. It is shown which classes of <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> can be replaced by others without changing the semantics of the corresponding transformation unit. Moreover, three properties of <b>control</b> <b>conditions</b> are studied: minimality, i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the temperature and relative humidity influence in the life cycle, mortality and fecundity patterns of Triatoma rubrovaria. Four cohorts with 60 recently laid eggs each were conformed. The cohorts were divided into two groups. In the <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> group insects were maintained in a dark climatic chamber under constant temperature and humidity, whereas triatomines of the ambiental temperature group were maintained at room temperature. Average incubation time was 15. 6 days in the <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> group and 19. 1 days in the ambiental temperature. In group <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> the time from egg to adult development lasted 10 months while group ambiental temperature took four months longer. Egg eclosion rate was 99. 1 % and 98. 3 % in <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> and ambiental temperature, respectively. Total nymphal mortality in <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> was 52. 6 % whereas in ambiental temperature was 51. 8 %. Mean number of eggs/female was 817. 6 <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions</b> and 837. 1 ambiental temperature. Fluctuating temperature and humidity promoted changes in the life cycle duration and in the reproductive performance of this species, although not in the species mortality...|$|R
40|$|I am {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} computer vision. In general my research is about detecting and recognizing objects. My doctoral dissertation is on the topic of face recognition across pose and illumination. The type of methods I apply are at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. Face recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision. There {{has been a lot of}} progress in the case of images taken under <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions.</b> There are many approaches for handling, variation of illumination and expression. There are also several approaches to handling pose variation. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement. When multiple confounding factors occur simultaneously the problem is often termed unconstrained face recognition. Progress in unconstrained face recognition would be important in many applications, for example: surveillance, security, the analysis of personal photos and other domains in which <b>we</b> cannot <b>control</b> the <b>conditions</b> under which the images are taken. Existing systems achieve excellent results when images are taken under <b>controlled</b> <b>conditions,</b> so that there is no variation in viewing conditions. Recently, there has been a good deal of work on recognition in the case of variations in viewing conditions that occur over a short period of time, such as variations in pose or lighting. Variations that occur over longer periods of time (such as aging and weight gain) are harder to study. Face recognition across pose is the task of determining whether two faces seen from different viewpoints and perhaps illuminated differently are of the same person. Recognizing faces across pose is important in safety and surveillance applications and also appears frequently in day to day tasks such as personal photo organization. The general direction of my research is in the area of direct image comparison for face recognition. I believe that direct image comparison is a very powerful method for face recognition in unconstrained settings. Summary of Previous and Ongoing Research In this section I will describe the research projects I’ve worked on. Here the projects are organized as independent units, while in reality they are more of a continuum. There are four projects, the first two are closer to “core ” computer vision and the final two are closer to machine learning...|$|R
