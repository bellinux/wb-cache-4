However, Phoumi still had access to a training battalion stationed outside Vientiane; on 4 August 1964, he ordered them into an attempted coup. This putsch was quelled by troops commanded by Kouprasith Abhay, and the training battalion disbanded.|$|E

The next day {{it was reported}} that former U.S. President Bill Clinton filmed a cameo appearance for the film in Bangkok {{while he was in the}} city to deliver a speech on clean energy.

When asked in an interview what people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to find out about}} her, she responded [...] "I guess people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to find out that I am a bit of a homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?"

500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob has no {{lines of}} {{dialogue}} {{during the first}} half of [...] "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose [...] "lamenting tones became [...] foundation for Sideshow Bob".|$|E

After this, Nakata went straight to his home studio, Contemode, and started working on material. Eventually, Suzuki met with the producer at the same location, which she described [...] "cozy", but decided to minimise the amount of staff attending with her {{in order to work}} on the track intimately. Nakata recalled that once working on the material, he questioned whether it was [...] "enough", to which Suzuki and her team gave ideas and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by the differences after each take.|$|E

[...] She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters.|$|E

[...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, [...] "It's almost as if [...] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E

500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Andy Strickland of Yahoo! Music {{asserts that}} the album's song [...] "English Trees" [...] shows Finn's [...] "brilliant weaving of a tale of loss and yearning marks him out as {{up there with the}} very best songwriters working today" [...] and of the album's musical {{structure}} as a whole, comments that it is a [...] "collection of songs that reflect Finn's usual palette of singalong pop ("She Called Up"), achingly fine ballads ("Pour le monde"), and darker, more ambient sounds ("A Sigh")". Jessica Letkemann of Billboard points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn's solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> insisting that [...] "Gone are the more overtly '80s top 40 flourishes". Bud Scoppa writes in Uncut Magazine that the album's extremes are portrayed in its first two songs, [...] "Nobody Wants To", which he describes as [...] " [...] the prevailing melancholy mood, as Finn's slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret", and [...] "Don't Stop Now", in which [...] "Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS, seeking [...] "something I can write about… something I can cry about"".|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{made his}} NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 {{loss to the}} Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from {{incurring}} a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when {{he was supposed to}} drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded [...] "Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play's a dandy." [...] He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season {{is considered one of the}} best in NFL history. He was named 1981's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him [...] the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.|$|E
