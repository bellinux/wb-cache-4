5|$|The third {{match was}} between Tyson Tomko and Stevie Richards, the {{man dressed in}} women's clothing. Tomko quickly gained the {{advantage}} after stripping off all of the clothes on Richards, leaving Richards left <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> woman's underwear. Tomko continued his attack on Richards by delivering a swinging neckbreaker and winning the match via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.|$|E
5|$|Richard Armitage {{secured the}} role of Lee {{when he arrived at}} his {{audition}} <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> old boots, something that greatly impressed producer Spencer Campbell. In order to match the scripted description of his character, Armitage began a heavy workout regimen and took aqua-aerobics lessons to better understand Lee's profession. His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona. Despite leaving the series in 2001, Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode. To make sure the rest of the cast agreed to return, their salaries were increased to £75,000 per episode, a 50% increase on their pay for the fourth series (though Joseph earned less).|$|E

50|$|For {{competition}}s, male gymnasts wear {{two layers}} of clothing. The first, a singlet (or comp shirt, short for competition shirt) is a sleeveless leotard. For floor and vault, gymnasts <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> very short shorts over the singlet. For their other events, they <b>wear</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long pants, attached {{to the bottom of}} the feet with stirrups.|$|R
50|$|In the {{warehouse}} scene, Billy Lo <b>wears</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> yellow Adidas shoes with black stripes and white shelltoes. Towards {{the end of}} the film, Billy <b>wears</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> yellow Onitsuka Tiger shoes, with black stripes. This was because the real Bruce Lee wore the latter when he was filming, and the double wore the former in the 1978 version to resemble his shoes.|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the women}} was floating, {{completely}} naked, holding onto an oar; she was brought on board the schooner <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> seaman's trousers that a seaman on the boat that picked her up had taken off and given to her. Later she recounted how she had had to fight off a number of men that had tried to take her oar.|$|E
25|$|No device {{resembling}} a bomb belt was reported as found. Menezes {{was also not}} carrying a tool bag, since he had left it with his colleague the previous evening.

25|$|The 1939 World's Fair on Treasure Island, in San Francisco Bay, {{attracted}} many celebrities to San Francisco {{and to the}} St. Francis.

25|$|Fonda {{appeared}} against type as {{the villain}} 'Frank' in 1968's Once Upon a Time in the West. After initially turning down the role, {{he was convinced}} to accept it by actor Eli Wallach and director Sergio Leone, who flew from Italy to the United States {{to persuade him to}} take the part. Fonda had planned on <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> brown-colored contact lenses, but Leone preferred the paradox of contrasting close-up shots of Fonda's innocent-looking blue eyes with the vicious personality of the character Fonda played.|$|E
25|$|Knorr also {{believed}} that her fourth husband, Chet Harris, had turned Suesan into a witch, so Suesan received the worst of Knorr's abuse. After one severe beating, Suesan ran away from home. She {{was picked up by}} police and placed in a psychiatric hospital where she told staff that her mother abused her. Knorr denied the abuse claims and told the hospital staff that Suesan had mental issues. Authorities did not investigate the matter further and released Suesan back into her mother's custody. Knorr punished Suesan for running away by beating her while <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> leather gloves. She also forced her other children to take turns beating their sister. In the subsequent weeks, Knorr handcuffed Suesan to her bed and ordered her other children to stand watch over her. Knorr refused to let Suesan leave the house and forced her to drop out of school. Knorr also pulled her other children out of school, and most of them never advanced past the eighth grade.|$|E

500|$|The ten-year-old Maxwell, {{having been}} raised in {{isolation}} on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school. The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior. His mannerisms and Galloway accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived {{on his first day}} of school <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of [...] "". He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years. Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met Lewis Campbell and Peter Guthrie Tait, two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.|$|E

500|$|Author John Einarson {{has noted}} that {{during this period of}} their career, the Byrds enjoyed {{tremendous}} popularity among teenage pop fans, with their music receiving widespread airplay on Top 40 radio and their faces adorning countless teen magazines. [...] Much was made {{at the time of the}} Byrds' unconventional dress sense, with their casual attire strikingly at odds with the prevailing trend for uniformity among contemporary beat groups. [...] With all five members sporting Beatlesque moptop haircuts, Crosby dressed in a striking green suede cape, and McGuinn <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> distinctive rectangular [...] "granny glasses", the band exuded California cool, while also looking suitably non-conformist. [...] In particular, McGuinn's distinctive rectangular spectacles would go on to become popular among members of the burgeoning hippie counterculture in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Columbian, Angela Allen {{commented that}} {{the first issue of}} the {{magazine}} [...] "shows attitude and literary writing, tosses off lots of names, does a terrific fall culture calendar and digs into a couple of issues, including the Trail Blazers", but was also critical, noting: [...] "Its design is crowded and the type is too small to read for most of us without <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 'reader' specs." [...] Tom Boyer of The Seattle Times described the magazine as [...] "a smart mix of reader-friendly features and award-winning journalism". Writing in The Oregonian, Steve Duin commented that he appreciated the lists published in the magazine: [...] "Because I'm addicted to lists -- and the bigger the better -- the best part of my month is the morning that copy of Portland Monthly lands like a wounded halibut on my desk." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{features}} a chiseled and muscular D'Angelo, wearing a small gold-chained crucifix necklace, lip-synching while filmed {{on a platform}} from the waist-up and appearing nude; he was <b>wearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> pajama bottoms during filming, which were not visible in the video as they were hung low away from the camera's view. Trenier later explained the idea of D'Angelo appearing alone, stating [...] "We didn't want an on-screen love interest. We {{wanted him to be}} able to make contact with whoever was watching it one-on-one". Consisting of entirely one shot, the music video begins with the camera opening on the back of D'Angelo's head before rotating to the front and drawing back to a larger view of his upper torso, as he begins to lip-synch to the track, set to an all-black background. It continues with camera close-ups of sweat trickling from his tattooed arms, chiseled chest and abdominal muscles, while also flirting with a peak of his shadowed, muscular hip. The video leads to D'Angelo making emotional gestures as he lip-synchs to the choral climax and the end of the song.|$|E
