500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport. Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was {{right at the top}} of the hour... He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E
500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E
