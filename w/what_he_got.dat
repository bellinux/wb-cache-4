2500|$|As {{provided}} by the secret treaty, the allies agreed in a [...] "Protocol of Subsidies" [...] that Bolivia had to bear {{the costs of the}} war. The agreement, which bound the tax income for many years, caused resentments and fears in Bolivia, where the deployment of Bolivian forces to Tacna was seen as a help to Peru and, moreover, when they knew that the Bolivian army wouldn't be sent to free the occupied region of Bolivia but to protect Peru. As Daza and his officers came to Tacna and Arica, they didn't see the expected Peruvian military strength and they understood that their position of power in Bolivia was threatened by a defeat of the allied armies. Bolivian historian Querejazu suggests that Daza used the Chilean offer of Tacna und Arica for Bolivia in order exert pressure on Peru to get a more favorable [...] "Protocolo de Subsidios", which is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Day claimed {{afterward}} that Loeb {{had attempted}} to assault him; however, {{it may have been}} the other way around. Many doubted that Day's story was true. It was not likely that he acted in self-defense. [...] Day emerged unharmed from the attack, while Loeb sustained more than 50 wounds from the attack, including numerous defensive wounds on his arms and hands. [...] Loeb's throat had also been slashed from behind, suggesting that he was attacked by surprise. [...] Nevertheless, an inquiry accepted Day's testimony. [...] The prison authorities, perhaps embarrassed by publicity sensationalizing alleged decadent behavior in the prison, ruled that Day's attack on Loeb was [...] self-defense. According to one widely reported account, newsman Ed Lahey wrote this lead for the Chicago Daily News: [...] "Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition." [...] Some papers went as far as to say that Loeb deserved <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got,</b> and appeared to praise James Day for his murder. [...] Day was later tried and acquitted of Loeb's murder.|$|E

6000|$|Lastly, Kinmont Willie, and Scott's {{share in}} it, is matter of presumption, not of proof. He {{had been in}} quest of the ballad, as we know from his list of desiderata; he says that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> was [...] "mangled" [...] by reciters, and that, in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got,</b> one river was {{mentioned}} where topography requires another. He also admits that, in the three ballads of rescues, he placed passages where they had most poetical appropriateness. My arguments to show that Satchells had memory of a Kinmont ballad will doubtless appeal with more or less success, or with none, to different students. That an indefinite quantity of the ballad, and improvements on the rest, are Scott's, I cannot doubt, from evidence of style.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} whole works, ain't it--leastwise he will have it all when he gets you. A man like that doesn't deserve <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got.</b> <b>He's</b> a chump. Do you suppose I'd go off and leave you alone in a hole like this with a smashed leg? I'd never bring you into such a country, in the first place.

6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} get him," [...] she said, when the tramp had {{concluded}} his talk with Kansas City. [...] "It's awful the carryings on they is nowadays.

6000|$|... "Ike Furner's mark," [...] remarked Wumble, {{pointing}} to the shavings. They {{had been told by}} several men that one of Furner's habits was to whittle a stick. He never rested and talked but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out his jackknife and started to cut on a bit of wood. At another campfire, two days back, they had come across a heap of just such whittlings.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{there must}} be nothing of that. Fatal. The wrong note entirely. Give me that {{telegraph}} form and pencil.

60|$|I'm {{bound to}} say I couldn't quite follow the {{development}} of the scenario. Bingo, while not absolutely rolling in the stuff, has always had a fair amount of the ready. Apart from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> from his uncle, I knew that he had finished up the jumping season well {{on the right side of}} the ledger. Why, then, was he lunching the girl at this God-forsaken eatery? It couldn't be because he was hard up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! as to that," [...] {{returned}} Bevan, {{with another}} of his peculiar smiles, [...] "I didn't exactly mean that. You were tempted, you know, pretty bad. Besides, Bully Gashford is a big rascal, an' richly deserves <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got.</b> No, it wasn't that I meant--but it's a bad look-out for you, lad, if they nab you. I knows the temper o' them Pine Tree men, an' they're in such a wax just now that they'll string you up, as sure as fate, if they catch you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now we {{know all}} that can be known about the copy of the ballad which, in 1805, Scott {{received}} from Hogg. Up to stanza xxiv. it is as given by the two old reciters. The crazy man may be the daft man who recited to Hogg Burns's Tam o' Shanter, and inspired him with the ambition to be a poet. The deranged woman, like mad Madge Wildfire, was rich in ballad scraps. From stanza xxv. to xxxiv., Hogg confessedly [...] "harmonises" [...] <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> in plain prose intermixed with verse. Stanza xxxix. is apparently Hogg's. The last broken stanza, as Hogg said, is a reminiscence of the Hunting of the Cheviot, in a Scots form, long lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why. It's {{not your}} fault. Very {{sporting}} of your brother and all that, of course, though I'm blowed if I'd {{have done it}} myself; but why should you do anything?

However, in 2012, a report stated that Reynolds had undergone a divorce and subsequently sold the Hollywood house, {{as well as his}} Cadillac, in a process of simplification. In response to the life changes that Reynolds has undergone in his older years, Regan has stated, [...] "That’s how he simplifies things down.
