5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus. A Pleistocene form from Europe <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as P.g.vetus.|$|E
5|$|The D-7 {{was another}} ground attack {{aircraft}} based on D-1 airframes upgraded to D-5 standard (armour, wing cannons, extended wing panels), while the D-8 <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> D-7 {{but based on}} D-3 airframes. The D-7 and D-8 were both were fitted with flame dampers, and could conduct night operations.|$|E

50|$|There {{are both}} SOHC and DOHC ZC engines. The non-VTEC SOHC ZC <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> D16A6 ('91-'96) and D16Y4 ('96-2000) engine, {{but with more}} {{aggressive}} cam timing.

5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{stimulus-response}} compatibility {{is known}} <b>to</b> also affect <b>the</b> choice reaction {{time for the}} Hick-Hyman Law. This means that <b>the</b> response should <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stimulus itself (such as turning a steering wheel <b>to</b> turn <b>the</b> wheels of the car). The action <b>the</b> user performs <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> response the driver receives from the car.|$|R

5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Granat was a three-axis-stabilized {{spacecraft}} and {{the last}} of the 4MV Bus produced by the Lavochkin Scientific Production Association. It <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989; for this reason, the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2. It weighed 4.4 metric tons and carried almost 2.3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation. Granat stood 6.5m tall and had a total span of 8.5 m across its solar arrays. The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400W.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II were re-released both {{separately}} {{and as a}} combined game for the PlayStation. The collection was released in Japan in 2002 as Final Fantasy I & II Premium Package and in Europe and North America in 2003 as Final Fantasy Origins. This version <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> WonderSwan Color remake and featured several changes such as more detailed graphics, a remixed soundtrack, added full motion video sequences, art galleries of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations, and a memo save function. On December 18, 2012, the port was re-released {{as part of the}} Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box release.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{government}} under William <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government that had existed under earlier dukes. It {{was a fairly}} simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, which consisted {{of a group of}} officers including stewards, butlers, and marshalls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it {{near the bottom of}} their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M3 Half-track, as it {{shared the}} same chassis, engine, {{suspension}}, armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum road speed of 45mph. The power-to-weight ratio was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E
5|$|The castle's layout {{was unusual}} for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location {{and the power of}} its builder.
