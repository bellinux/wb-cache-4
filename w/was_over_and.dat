5|$|After George's abdication in 1292, Aldimir had to flee into exile. He {{may have}} {{followed}} his brother as a refugee in the Byzantine Empire, though he certainly {{settled in the}} Golden Horde not long thereafter. Perhaps with Tatar approval, Aldimir returned to Bulgaria in 1298, after the reign of Smilets (r. 1292–1298) <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> the empire was {{in the hands of}} the child Tsar Ivan II and his mother, the widow of Smilets tentatively known as Smiltsena. Aldimir pledged his loyalty to Smiltsena, who either granted him the domain south of the Balkan Mountains or restored him to his former appanage. To consolidate that union, Aldimir married Smiltsena's daughter, the princess Maria, possibly in late 1298.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} {{to threaten the}} Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time the morale of the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
5|$|By 1351 the Byzantine {{civil war}} <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> John VI Kantakouzenos had {{realized}} {{the threat posed}} by the Ottomans to the Balkan Peninsula. He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships, but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions. A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355, after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor. To cement the treaty, Ivan Alexander's daughter Keraca Marija was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos, but the alliance failed to produce concrete results.|$|E

5|$|From late 1919 {{until the}} 1921 Treaty of Riga, Cooper {{was a member}} of a {{volunteer}} American flight squadron, the Kościuszko Squadron, which supported the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War. On July 13, 1920, his plane was shot down and he spent nearly nine months in a Soviet prisoner of war camp where the writer Isaac Babel interviewed him. He escaped just before the war <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> made it to Latvia. For his valor he was decorated by Polish commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski with the highest Polish military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.|$|E

In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the third group of NASA astronauts. After his naval tour <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered {{him the opportunity to}} continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, to work on his Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E

Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi scored another {{touchdown}} before halftime, and the Hokies {{clung to}} a 17–14 lead {{at the beginning}} of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21–17 lead. Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> earned the victory, 34–17. The Virginia Tech offense was stymied by repeated turnovers. Tech fumbled the ball threetimes and Tech quarterback Humphries threw twointerceptions. Tech committed 120yards in penalties and was held to just twopassing yards for the entire game.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{strategies}} Gandhi adopted was to work with Muslim leaders of pre-partition India, to oppose the British imperialism in and outside the Indian subcontinent. After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim leadership support of Ali Brothers by backing the Khilafat Movement in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic Ottoman Caliphate, and opposing the secular Islam supporting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the Caliphate, the Khilafat Movement <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated.|$|E

Boxer continued this support as UN troops advanced north and into North Korea, but departed for the United States on 11 November for refit and overhaul. US military commanders believed the war in Korea <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> had ordered {{a number of other}} carriers out of the area and were subsequently under-prepared {{at the beginning of the}} Chosin Reservoir Campaign when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war against the UN. Battlefield commanders requested Boxer return to Korea as soon as possible, but she did not immediately return as commanders feared it might reduce the Navy's ability to respond if another conflict or emergency broke out elsewhere.|$|E

However, things did not go Warner's way; {{at the beginning of}} the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared that the war <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E

5|$|The war had {{shattered}} Pound's {{belief in}} modern western civilization. He saw the Vorticist movement as finished and doubted his own {{future as a}} poet. He had only the New Age to write for; his relationship with Poetry was finished, The Egoist was quickly {{running out of money}} because of censorship problems caused by the serialization of Joyce's Ulysses, and the funds for The Little Review had dried up. Other magazines ignored his submissions or refused to review his work.

5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, Kitchener {{ordered a}} flying column, led by Major-General Sir Archibald Hunter and {{composed}} of around three-thousand Egyptian soldiers, to march from Merowe to Abu Hamed with all possible speed. The flying column departed Merawi on 29 July 1897, and, marching north-east along the Nile for eight days, {{arrived at the}} town as dawn broke on August 7. Forming his battalions in a broad semi-circle that pitted Abu Hamed’s defenders against the river, Major-General Hunter ordered his troops to advance at approximately six-thirty that morning. In the action that followed, the outnumbered Mahdist riflemen were driven from their defensive positions through the town, while a small contingent of Mahdist cavalry fled south without engaging to report the loss. By seven-thirty, the battle <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> Major-General Hunter ordered the news be delivered to Lord Kitchener.|$|E
5|$|At their nominating {{convention}} in Louisville on May 11, 1887, Kentucky Republicans nominated Bradley for Governor of Kentucky to oppose Democrat Simon B. Buckner, a former Confederate general. In his acceptance speech, Bradley implored Kentuckians {{to realize that}} the Civil War <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> to discontinue their practice of electing ex-Confederate Democrats to public office. His platform included proposals for education, implementing of a high protective tariff, and developing the state's resources. He pointed out that, though Kentucky contained more coal than Pennsylvania, the state bought half of its coal from that state. A similar situation existed with regard to lumber. He was also critical of excessive spending during the preceding Democratic administrations. Among his cited examples of extravagance were the creation of a state bureau of agriculture and {{the construction of a new}} state penitentiary. Democratic mismanagement of the state's affairs had resulted in able, young Kentuckians leaving the state to seek their fortunes because of a lack of opportunity at home, Bradley lamented.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in March–April 1916 as part of the Repeat War Programme. The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan {{shipyard}} on 22 July 1916. She was launched on 12 April 1917 and completed on 25 June 1917. She became flagship of the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet the following month. Cardiff participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917. This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Cardiff fired the most of any ship in her squadron, but did not hit any German ships. She was, however, hit four or five times herself, killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen, but was only lightly damaged. Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea. By 21 November 1918 the war <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> Cardiff had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the Firth of Forth to be interned.|$|E
