500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
500|$|Crew {{members have}} also reacted {{positively}} towards the episode. Carter {{said of the}} episode: The Erlenmeyer Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. It just has terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do, which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't the best you can get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E

We {{like being in the}} studio and when we get in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

Bawinkel stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "a bunch of the tunes cover <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say to them during those times [...]" [...] Michael Weaver, writing for Jesus Freak Hideout, interpreted the song as an attempt to convince this individual to turn his or her life around and return to the Christian faith. The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking for happiness. The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking for happiness in physical strength. He believes that if he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks for happiness in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires. There is something more which is hopeful for some and frustrating for others." ...|$|E

However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing.

500|$|On {{expanding}} {{the characters in}} the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of Avengers films, Feige stated, it's about [...] "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not." [...] In April 2014, Feige revealed that Edgar Wright's pitch for Ant-Man in 2006 helped shape the early films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "We changed, frankly, some of the MCU to accommodate this version of Ant-Man. Knowing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to Avengers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Radiohead toured {{in support}} of their second album The Bends. Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, but he later said [...] "Lucky" [...] shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: [...] "'Lucky' was indicative of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It was like the first mark on the wall." ...|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just {{said that it is}} not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{uses the}} same engine as Nights into Dreams.... When Sonic Team {{developed}} Nights into Dreams..., they were new to programming for the Sega Saturn, and when the engine was re-used for Burning Rangers {{they were able to}} make it faster and more capable. To design the stages and environments, Miyoshi outlined the corridors first, then placed fires in them before adding light effects to simulate the appearance of fire. Miyoshi thought that the team had over-reached in designing the game's detailed stages, saying: [...] "everyone in the team wanted to put so much into the game that we only completed about half of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Naka said that although they designed only four stages, they ensured that the player's experience would increase progressively throughout the game because each stage was very large. The developers initially used motion capture technology to capture data for poses and animation, but Naka soon discovered {{that it was impossible to}} get the results the team wanted, as it was unfeasible for people to perform the special motions they needed. The developers resorted to creating the animation by hand, and only used the motion capture data for the player characters' walking animations.|$|E
500|$|The team quickly {{recognized}} that [...] "the controller {{really was the}} kind of magic sauce for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do". [...] They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power [...] "to provide a little more depth to the game— some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes". Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller. [...] The controller initially had pressure-sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex. [...] The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game. The team had spent [...] "precious development time and resources" [...] into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay.|$|E

Following Hurley's modifications to Tormé's scripts for [...] "The Royale" [...] and [...] "", Tormé elected to be credited under a pseudonym only. At one point, Roddenberry had thought that Tormé would become eventual showrunner, but the writer left due to the re-writes required under Hurley's tenure. Hannah Louise Shearer also left the team between seasons, due to differences with Hurley, but contributed stories in later seasons. Other writers joined the team during the second season, including The Tears of the Singers author Melinda M. Snodgrass, who sold the script for [...] "". Hans Beimler and Richard Manning were hired in the newly created positions of executive script consultants. They had both been story editors for the final eight episodes of the first season. Snodgrass later explained that, [...] "Once I came on board there suddenly seemed to be this climate of discussion among the writers about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do with the show. My impression {{was that this was}} a new phenomenon. We were a little bit more on the same wavelength."

I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had.

500|$|After {{some time}} {{developing}} demos, the musicians returned to Henson in March 2012, recording seven songs before the band {{decided to take}} a break, as according to guitarist Mike McCready [...] "we had to take some time to figure out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn’t feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio—though McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron—before the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don’t keep as much of [...] as we used to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E
