5|$|John {{was born}} to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had {{inherited}} significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, {{in addition to being}} the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers. The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 an agreement, {{known as}} the Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal and the United Kingdom was {{negotiated}} {{in order to determine}} what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gurkhas upon the formalisation of India's Independence. As a result of this agreement it was decided that of the pre-war Gurkha regiments, four would be transferred to the British Army, while six—one of which was the 1st Gurkhas—would become part of the newly independent Indian Army.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, {{there was}} a major debate in the SPD about the tactics it would choose after the lifting of the Anti-Socialist Laws. A radical oppositional wing known as Die Jungen (The Young Ones) developed. While the party leaders viewed the {{parliament}} as a means of social change, Die Jungen thought it could at best be used to spread the socialist message. They were unwilling to wait for the collapse of capitalist society, as predicted by Marxism, rather they wanted to start a revolution as soon as possible. Although this wing was strongest in Berlin, Magdeburg, and Dresden, it also had a few adherents in Mainz, among them Rudolf Rocker. In May 1890, he started a reading circle, named Freiheit (Freedom), to study theoretical topics more intensively. After Rocker criticized Jöst and refused to retract his statements, he was expelled from the party. The same <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of Die Jungen in October 1891. Nonetheless, he remained active and even gained influence in the socialist labor movement in Mainz. Although he had already encountered anarchist ideas {{as a result of his}} contacts to Die Jungen in Berlin, his conversion to anarchism did not take place until the International Socialist Congress in Brussels in August 1891. He was heavily disappointed by the discussions at the congress, as it, especially the German delegates, refused to explicitly denounce militarism. He was rather impressed by the Dutch socialist and later anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, who attacked Liebknecht for his lack of militancy. Rocker got to know Karl Höfer, a German active in smuggling anarchist literature from Belgium to Germany. Höfer gave him Bakunin's God and the State and Kropotkin's Anarchist Morality, two of the most influential anarchist works, as well as the newspaper Autonomie.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{exploring}} {{the effects of}} the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in science fiction novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, Earth Abides, portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, {{through the eyes of a}} survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see." ...|$|E

[...] In 1928, Herriman took over the strip Embarrassing Moments, which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists. [...] The strip eventually became Bernie Burns, in which embarrassing moments <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> title character. [...] The strip appeared in few papers, and after it ended in 1932, Herriman worked only on Krazy Kat, although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis' popular Archy and Mehitabel, a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach.|$|E
500|$|The World Without Us is a non-fiction {{book about}} what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural and built {{environment}} if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist Alan Weisman {{and published by}} St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books. It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 Discover article [...] "Earth Without People". Written largely as a thought experiment, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, bronze statues, plastics, and Mount Rushmore would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} scheduled to feature Dan Nelson on vocals. However, following the events later that year, {{he was no}} longer a member of the band. When asked what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> completed studio album featuring Nelson's vocals, Ian said: [...] "Until we have a new singer, I can't tell you {{what will happen to the}} record. We'll probably change a few things on it, including the vocals." [...] Ian also indicated that the album's release could be delayed until 2010. It was assumed that John Bush was going to record new vocals for the album after his reunion with the band. However, this did not happen. In an interview at the time, Bush said he was trying to re-record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{unresolved}} {{question of}} what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem. His reply, [...] "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. [...] Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.|$|E

Three days after Live Nation's endorsement, UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid {{to take over the}} Olympic Stadium in legacy mode. In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for [...] "informal discussions" [...] about what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.|$|E

500|$|In 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie {{applied for}} a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched {{property}} owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would {{find it hard to}} understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game {{became one of the first}} board games to use a [...] "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of [...] "ownership" [...] of a place on a game board, such that something <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives. This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.|$|E
500|$|Moon became {{involved}} in solo work {{when he moved to}} Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. In 1974, Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single covering the Beach Boys' [...] "Don't Worry, Baby" [...] and [...] "Teenage Idol." [...] The next year he released his only solo album, entitled Two Sides of the Moon. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. NME's Roy Carr wrote, [...] "Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept Two Sides of the Moon." [...] Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, wrote: [...] "There isn't any legitimate reason for this album's existence." [...] During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC's Wide World), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kit, he joked that [...] "even the best drummers get hungry." [...] His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.|$|E
500|$|Three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. After Peters addressed the House {{in favor of the}} Maine bill, Connecticut's John Q. Tilson inquired if the proposed coin would replace the existing design (the Walking Liberty half dollar) {{for the rest of the}} year; Peters explained that it would not, and that only 100,000 coins would bear the commemorative design. [...] John Franklin Miller of Washington state asked who would bear the expenses of the coinage dies, and Peters responded that the state of Maine would. Virginia's Andrew Jackson Montague asked if the Treasury Department had endorsed the bill, and Peters informed him that both Houston and Baker had. Vestal asked that the bill be passed, but Ohio's Warren Gard had questions about what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coins once they entered circulation; Peters stated that they would, once issued, be treated as ordinary half dollars. In response to questions by Gard, Peters explained that although Maine would pay for the dies, they would become federal government property. Peters added that though there would be no statewide celebration in Maine for the centennial, there would be local observances. Gard had no further questions about the Maine bill (he would also quiz the sponsors of the Alabama and Pilgrim bills), and on Vestal's motion it passed without recorded dissent.|$|E

2500|$|Caballero {{was written}} in a decade marked by heated debate about the Mexican-American's place in United States society. The 1930s saw {{the birth of the}} League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other {{organizations}} that promoted the cultural assimilation of peoples of Latin American heritage into mainstream United States culture. Within LULAC, however, there was disagreement about the forms and the extent of this assimilation. Male [...] "Lulackers" [...] typically promoted assimilation in public but sought to maintain patriarchal structures in private. Many females, however, countered this public/private assimilation and advocated for the modernization of gender roles, especially within Mexican-American homes. González was one of the more vocal of these women, and Caballero, which holds at its center a doomed patriarch who refuses to part ways with traditions that subordinate women, can be read as her [...] "warning of what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ethnic Mexican community if it resisted the democratization of [...] gender roles and ignored the modernization of Mexican American female subjectivity".|$|E
2500|$|This view best {{explains}} the word [...] "derashah" [...] (lecture), which occurs about thirty {{times in the}} Sheiltot, {{in connection with the}} citation of passages from the Talmud. If the supposition be true that the Sheiltot were derived from sermons, they may properly be considered, in the form in which they appear, as extracts or abstracts of such sermons, giving the introduction and the conclusion of the original derashah; while of the derashah proper—which no doubt consisted of aggadic and halakic quotations from Talmud and Midrash—only the heading is mentioned. Considering them as portions of sermons, the frequent repetitions that occur in the Sheiltot are not strange, as this <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> best of preachers; while {{it would be difficult to}} explain them if they were found in the strictly literary productions of one man. Of course, there can be no certain conclusions concerning the composition of the [...] "Sheiltot" [...] until the manuscript has been examined. The printed text, while it contains much matter of later date, lacks much that, according to older authorities, was formerly included. An accurate edition of the Sheiltot would be very valuable for textual criticism of the Babylonian Talmud, as indeed for Aramaic philology in general, since Aḥa wrote in the Aramaic vernacular.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 prime {{minister}} Kevin Rudd {{introduced a new}} asylum policy which meant that all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be sent offshore to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for processing and resettlement. This included gay refugees, even though they face persecution under Papua New Guinean law with homosexual acts criminalised and a potential penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Asylum seekers are warned in an orientation presentation on arrival by the Salvation Army that [...] "Homosexuality is illegal in Papua New Guinea. People have been imprisoned or killed for performing homosexual acts." [...] This places them {{in the position of}} being required to declare their sexuality to be eligible for refugee protection yet liable to face persecution from other people and under local laws. Gay asylum seekers also face bullying, assault and sexual abuse on Manus Island from others, including officials and other refugees, due to their sexuality. Australia faces accusations from refugee advocates that it has violated its non-refoulement obligations under international law by exposing LGBT asylum seekers to such dangers.
