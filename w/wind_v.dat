40|$|X-rays from {{planetary}} nebulae (PNs) {{are believed to}} originate from a shock driven into the fast stellar <b>wind</b> (<b>v</b> ~ 1000 kilometers per second) as it collides with an earlier circumstellar slow <b>wind</b> (<b>v</b> ~ 10 kilometers per second). In theory, the shocked fast wind (hot hubble) and the ambient cold nebula can remain separated by magnetic fields along a surface {{referred to as the}} contact discontinuity (CD) that inhibits diffusion and heat conduction. The CD region is extremely difficult to probe directly owing to its small size and faint emission. This has largely left the study of CDs, stellar-shocks, and the associated micro-physics in the realm of theory. This paper presents spectroscopic evidence for ions from the hot bubble (kT approximately equal to 100 eV) crossing the CD and penetrating the cold nebular gas (kT approximately equal to 1 eV). Specifically, a narrow radiative recombination continuum (RRC) emission feature is identified in the high resolution X-ray spectrum of the PN BD+ 30 degree 3639 indicating bare C VII ions are recombining with cool electrons at kT(sub e) = 1. 7 plus or minus 1. 3 eV. An upper limit to the flux of the narrow RRC of H-like C VI is obtained as well. The RRCs are interpreted as due to C ions from the hot bubble of BD+ 30 degree 3639 crossing the CD into the cold nebula, where they ultimately recombine with its cool electrons. The RRC flux ratio of C VII to C VI constrains the temperature jump across the CD to deltakT greater than 80 eV, providing for the first time direct evidence for the stark temperature disparity between the two sides of an astrophysical CD, and constraining the role of magnetic fields and heat conduction accordingly. Two colliding-wind binaries are noted to have similar RRCs suggesting a temperature jump and CD crossing by ions may be common feature of stellar wind shocks...|$|E

The characteristics of this magnetospheric state defined by solar <b>wind</b> <b>V,</b> N and P are responsible for the amount of energy uploaded during the growth phase and subsequently released during the expansive phase, and hence for the intensity of a substorm. Therefore, we study the behavior of the IMF components, {{as well as of the}} solar wind velocity, number density, and dynamic pressure, preceding isolated substorms of different intensities, in order to examine their influence on the energy loading to the magnetosphere before substorm onset. The dependence of the loading on the SYM/H index of geomagnetic activity is also investigated.|$|E

During the positive SAH anomalies years, roughly speaking, the sea level pressure (SLP) and the zonal surface wind (u 10) are analogous to that of the positive SAM phase, but they also show an anomalous zonal-wave- 3 -like (ZW 3 -like) pattern over the mid latitudes. The surface temperature (ST) variations are not similar to the SAM. Nevertheless, these changes are related with the anomalous cyclones and meridional surface <b>wind</b> (<b>v</b> 10). The relationship between the SAH and SAM is also a manifestation of the interhemispheric interaction, and this study contributes {{to the understanding of the}} global change...|$|E
