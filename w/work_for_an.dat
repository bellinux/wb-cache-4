40|$|Purpose: We {{study the}} effects of {{personal}} features in the Galician labour market, as both self-employed people and employees who <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm. Design/methodology/approach: We propose a wage model to estimate the probability of a person in working age being employee who <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm. After the model parameter estimation through binary logistic regression, we estimate the conditional probability to be <b>an</b> employee who <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm <b>for</b> different personal features. We do this to evaluate the real effect of personal features in the person role in the labour market, as employee who <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm or self-employed person. Findings and originality/value: The probability to be <b>an</b> employee who <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm depends on the gender. The greater age, the lower is the probability of men and women that they will be employees who <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm. The probability of men to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm is the same to all family size, whereas this probability for women is lower if the family size gests bigger. The greater corrected family income, the lower is the probability of men and women to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm, but the percentages are different. Research limitations/implications: This paper has been made during a moment of sustained economic growth. So, future researches could study the effect of the economic cycle in this topic. Practical implications: The gender differences affects to the labour market. Originality/value: This study considers as the most important variable the gender, and the effect of other explanatory variables on the different probabilities to be <b>an</b> employee who <b>works</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> firm change depending on the gender. We propose a new way to create the variable corrected household income...|$|R

25|$|Detector dogs begin {{training}} {{between the}} ages of 11 and 16 months and <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> average of 8 to 10 years. Several different breeds are used, but the CBSA primarily uses Labrador Retrievers for firearm, drug and currency detection, and the Beagle for plant, food and animal detection. Dogs that are used to detect firearms, drugs and currency live with their handler. However, dogs trained to detect agricultural products live in a commercial kennel as living around large amounts of food full-time can cause the dog to become desensitized to some scents. While the dog is at work, it is transported in air-conditioned vehicles that act as a mobile kennel.|$|E
25|$|In 1814 Coles wrote {{a letter}} to his Albemarle County {{neighbor}} Thomas Jefferson, asking the former President to again embark on a campaign of emancipation and publicly <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> end to slavery in Virginia. Jefferson’s response has become a signal document in the study of Jefferson’s troubling and complex relationship with the institution of slavery. At age 71 and generally retired from politics and because Virginia law did not allow for emancipation of slaves, Jefferson declined Cole’s request, advising his young friend and associate to stay in Virginia to help in the long-term demise of slavery. Coles’ disappointment is clear in his return letter of September 26, 1814.|$|E

25|$|Unlike a chattel slave, a wage laborer can (barring {{unemployment}} {{or lack of}} job offers) {{choose between}} employers, but they usually constitute a minority of owners in the population for which the wage laborer must work, while attempts to implement workers' control on employers' businesses may be considered an act of theft or insubordination, and thus be met with violence, imprisonment or other legal and social measures. The wage laborer's starkest choice is to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> employer or face poverty or starvation. If a chattel slave refuses to work, a number of punishments are also available; from beatings to food deprivation – although economically rational slave owners practiced positive reinforcement to achieve best results and before losing their investment by killing an expensive slave.|$|E

25|$|Cullinan {{was born}} to John Francis and Mary (Considine) Cullinan on December 31, 1860, in Pulaski Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, not far from Sharon, Pennsylvania. His first {{experience}} {{in the oil industry}} was when he was 14, working as a hand in the Pennsylvania oilfields. He was responsible for various oil-related duties including an oil distribution station in Oleopolis, Pennsylvania. This familiarity with all the aspects of the industry would later on be beneficial for his wisdom and sound judgment in the oil business. On April 14, 1891, he married Lucy Halm.

25|$|The player {{controls}} the smallest doll, Charlie Blackmore, who {{is attempting to}} reunite his family that is being forced to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> evil industrialist named The Baron. Charlie is able to jump inside dolls that are one size larger than he and control them, {{as long as the}} larger doll is facing away from him. If the player already controls a stack of dolls, that stack can jump into a one-size-larger doll as well. The player can also unstack the dolls at any time in order to enter dolls smaller than his current stack. Certain unique dolls, outside of Charlie, have their own special abilities—such as the ability to unlock doors, float to higher locations, or lure other dolls around, which can be used by the outermost doll. Thus, the player must stack and unstack the set of dolls possessed by Charlie to solve puzzles throughout the game. Later puzzles may require the use of multiple dolls to combine their skills.|$|E
