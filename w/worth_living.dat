5|$|During the 1952–53 TV season, Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, host of Life Is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living,</b> won an Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Personality. Sheen {{beat out}} CBS's Arthur Godfrey, Edward R. Murrow and Lucille Ball, {{who were also}} {{nominated}} for the same award. Sheen was also nominated for – but did not win – consecutive Public Service Emmys in 1952, 1953, and 1954.|$|E
5|$|Life is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living</b> was not {{the only}} DuMont program to achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, Time {{magazine}} reported that popular DuMont game show Down You Go had attracted an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont's summer 1954 replacement series, The Goldbergs, achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC's and CBS's highest-rated programs.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the novel, Renée {{comes out}} of her {{internal}} seclusion, teaching young Paloma that not all adults pursue vanity at the expense of their intelligence and humanity. However, only shortly after Renée realizes that the beauty of life and her connections with the world makes life <b>worth</b> <b>living,</b> she dies {{in the same way as}} Roland Barthes; she is struck down by a laundry van. This leaves Paloma and Ozu devastated but leads Paloma not to commit suicide.|$|E

The average job hunt can take {{anywhere}} from 4 to 8 {{months in the}} US; {{most experts agree that}} workers who wish to quit should financially prepare with at least 6 months <b>worth</b> of <b>living</b> expenses. However, 69% of Americans have less than $1000 in savings, which is less than 1 month <b>worth</b> of <b>living</b> expenses in the US. The risk of running out of savings before a replacement job is found is a major disincentive to switching jobs.|$|R

5|$|In February 1950, Hooper's {{competitor}} A. C. Nielsen {{bought out}} the Hooperatings system. DuMont did not fare {{well with the}} change: none of its shows appeared on Nielsen's annual top 20 lists {{of the most popular}} series. One of the DuMont Network's biggest hits of the 1950s, Life is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living,</b> received Nielsen ratings of up to 11.1, attracting more than 10 million viewers. Sheen's one-man program – in which he discussed philosophy, psychology and other fields of thought from a Christian perspective – was the most widely viewed religious series in the history of television. 169 local television stations aired Life, and for three years the program competed successfully against NBC's popular The Milton Berle Show. The ABC and CBS programs which aired in the same timeslot were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nearly the}} entire DuMont film archive was destroyed, several {{surviving}} DuMont shows have been released on DVD. A large number of episodes of Life Is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living</b> have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added {{to the end of}} many episodes, a still image of Bishop Sheen looking into a DuMont Television camera can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of Cavalcade of Stars and The Morey Amsterdam Show. Two more DuMont programs, Captain Video and His Video Rangers and Rocky King, Inside Detective, have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming.|$|E
25|$|For 20 {{years as}} Father Sheen, later Monsignor, he hosted the night-time radio program The Catholic Hour on NBC (1930–1950) {{before moving to}} {{television}} and presenting Life Is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living</b> (1951–1957). Sheen's final presenting role was on the syndicated The Fulton Sheen Program (1961–1968) with a format {{very similar to that}} of the earlier Life is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living</b> show. For this work, Sheen twice won an Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, and was featured on the cover of Time Magazine. Starting in 2009, his shows were being re-broadcast on the EWTN and the Trinity Broadcasting Network's Church Channel cable networks. Due to his contribution to televised preaching Sheen is often referred to as one of the first televangelists.|$|E

25|$|John Harris, former {{editor-in-chief}} of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues {{that as long as}} life is <b>worth</b> <b>living,</b> according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 {{he began}} a weekly {{television}} program on the DuMont Television Network titled Life Is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living.</b> Filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City, the program consisted of the unpaid Sheen simply speaking {{in front of a}} live audience without a script or cue cards, occasionally using a chalkboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the book takes the form of several novellas {{connected}} by Lazarus's retrospective narrative. In the framing story, Lazarus has decided that life is no longer <b>worth</b> <b>living,</b> but (in what is described as a reverse Arabian Nights scenario) agrees not to end his life for as long as his companion, chief executive of the Howard families, and descendant Ira Weatherall, will listen to his stories.|$|E

25|$|Although Emanuel opposes legalized euthanasia, he {{believes}} that after age 75 life is not <b>worth</b> <b>living,</b> {{and the pursuit of}} longevity, not a worthwhile goal for U.S. health care policy. This is refuted by neurosurgeon and medical ethicist Miguel Faria, who in two articles in Surgical Neurology International claims that healthy lifestyles and brain plasticity can lead to the postponement of senescence and lead to happiness even as we age.|$|E
25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it <b>worth</b> <b>living.</b> People may create meaning {{in their own}} lives, {{which may not be}} the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.|$|E
25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life is <b>worth</b> <b>living</b> only {{if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E

Oh! {{it was a strange}} wild hour, well <b>worth</b> the <b>living,</b> and I wondered greatly, from moment to moment, which of us twain would conquer, as we matched guile with guile and force to force! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} told by the village hunters that there were no deer; that they had {{vanished}} long since, hounded and crusted and chevied out of season, till life was not <b>worth</b> the <b>living.</b> So it was with a start of surprise and a thrill of new interest that I came upon the tracks of a large buck and two smaller deer on the shore one morning. I was following them eagerly when I ran plump upon Old Wally, the cunningest hunter and trapper in the whole region.|$|R
6000|$|... "It always {{appears to}} me," [...] said my uncle, [...] "that the {{comparison}} of ideals to furniture is particularly appropriate. They are the draperies of the mind, and they hide the nakedness of truth. Your fireplace is ugly, your mere necessary shelves and seats but planks and crudity, all your surroundings so much office furniture, until the skilful hand and the draperies come in. Then a few cunning loopings and foldings, and behold softness and delicacy, crudity gone, and life well <b>worth</b> the <b>living.</b> So that you cannot value ideals too highly.|$|R
25|$|The fairies wonder why, if {{the mortal}} world is so miserable, its {{inhabitants}} {{do not take}} their own lives. Selene explains that mortals have one great gift that makes life <b>worth</b> <b>living</b> – the gift of Love. The fairies are in wonder at Selene's description, as they have never experienced Love. Selene explains that Love is unnecessary. Moreover, {{it is impossible for}} them to experience it, as only a mortal can inspire love, and mortals cannot set foot in Fairyland.|$|E
25|$|The show ran until 1957, drawing {{as many as}} 30million {{people on}} a weekly basis. In 1958, Sheen became {{national}} director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, serving for eight years before being appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Rochester, New York, on October 26, 1966. He also hosted a nationally syndicated series, The Fulton Sheen Program, from 1961 to 1968 (first {{in black and white}} and then in color). The format of this series was essentially the same as Life Is <b>Worth</b> <b>Living.</b>|$|E
25|$|DBT draws its {{principles}} from {{behavioral science}} (including cognitive-behavioral techniques), dialectical philosophy and Zen practice. The treatment emphasizes balancing acceptance and change (hence dialectic), {{with the overall}} goal of helping patients not just survive but build a life <b>worth</b> <b>living.</b> Treatment is delivered in four stages, with self-harm and other life-threatening issues taking priority. In the second stage, patients are encouraged to experience the painful emotions {{that they have been}} avoiding. Stage three addresses problems of living such as career and marital problems. Finally, stage four focuses on helping clients feel complete and reducing feelings of emptiness and boredom.|$|E

6000|$|When {{the author}} to the Hebrews had {{given us a}} {{catalogue}} of the worthies of the Old Testament, he saith at last, [...] "These all died in faith." [...] In the faith of what? That they should lie and rot in their grave eternally? No, verily; this is the faith of Ranters, not of Christians. They all died in faith, that they should rise again; and therefore counted this world not <b>worth</b> the <b>living</b> in, upon unworthy terms, that after death [...] "they might obtain a better resurrection" [...] (Heb 11:13,35).|$|R
25|$|In Angel season four, Angel is {{reverted to}} the evil Angelus after having his soul removed. Faith is {{approached}} by her former Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), who informs her of Angelus's presence, sparking her {{to break out}} of prison and help them. Wanting to help Angel the way he helped her, Faith injects herself with a mystical drug and feeds herself to Angelus in order to incapacitate him so that their allies can work to restore his soul. She nearly dies from the drug, but during a psychic mind walk, Angel persuades her subconscious not to give up and that life is <b>worth</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life <b>worth</b> <b>living</b> is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it <b>worth</b> <b>living.</b> A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle of individuality {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.|$|E
40|$|One recent {{trend in}} {{medicine}} {{has been a}} redefinition of chronic illness. Whereas formerly chronic illness referred to a disease “which is progressive, steadily or with remissions, towards severe crippling or death,” it is now defined as a “long-term disease which might be cured if given adequate prolonged treatment or which might remit for long periods after treatment, enabling the patient to return to <b>worth</b> while <b>living.</b> ” Coupled with this new perspective has been {{the development of the}} therapeutic community which calls for the treatment of the patient as a 'total individual' and not simply as a personified diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|For James, the {{existence}} of God is not merely what must be confessed, but what must be made plausible by some proof or evidence. He {{paid attention to the}} religious men's mystical experiences as their own proof for {{the existence}} of God. But, he also emphasized the significance of "science of religions", which ask for more "objective" evidence for it. E. B. Suckiel criticizes James's persistence to such a science. This paper offers a counterargument to her argument. James's persistence to science is, in my opinion, based upon his own deep want to make our life <b>worth</b> while <b>living...</b>|$|R
