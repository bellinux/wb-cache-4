25|$|As in the {{one-dimensional}} case, {{the energy}} is quantized. The ground state energy is N times the one-dimensional ground energy, as <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> using the analogy to N independent one-dimensional oscillators. There is one further difference: in the one-dimensional case, each energy level {{corresponds to a}} unique quantum state. In N-dimensions, except for the ground state, the energy levels are degenerate, meaning there are several states with the same energy.|$|E
25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking. This is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If I had done something different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{influential}} folklorist Cecil Sharp {{felt that}} these competing variants {{of a traditional}} song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological natural selection: only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would {{be picked up by}} others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing— it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] “That {{the federal}} treaty-making {{authority}} is {{constrained by the}} other parts of the Constitution does not sound like the stuff of law journals. It seems like common sense. After all, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> someone to argue that the ability to “regulate Commerce” entitles Congress to disregard the Third Amendment and quarter soldiers in our houses. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> to see an argument that the power to “establish Post Offices” enables Congress to disregard the freedom of the press in the First Amendment. So, why is the Tenth Amendment so fully disregarded with respect to treaties?...|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, the {{short-term}} stratospheric ozone fluctuations {{are not getting}} stronger than 3 % in average. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> have <b>expected</b> that stronger amplitudes would occur at the polar vortex edge during times of breaking planetary Rossby waves.|$|R
30|$|We also {{expected}} that, for disparities within Panum’s fusional limit, stimuli would be fused {{into a coherent}} percept, but for diplopia to occur for larger disparities. Binocular fusion {{might be expected to}} be important in establishing a convincing 3 D experience with a sense of solid, 3 D objects. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> then <b>expect</b> a convincing 3 D experience when stimuli are fused and for this to diminish for large disparities, for which fusion does not occur. Equally, when disparities are small, and the stimuli do not differ substantially from those experienced with a non-stereoscopic display, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> observers to report a strong 3 D experience.|$|R
25|$|Recall that {{vertical}} coordinate {{lines in}} our chart represent the world {{lines of the}} dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.|$|E
25|$|If {{older adults}} have fewer attentional {{resources}} than younger adults, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> that when two tasks must {{be carried out}} at the same time, older adults' performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli {{for an extended period of}} time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least through the seventh decade of life. More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.|$|E
25|$|Such changes, they argue, {{include not}} just {{well-known}} physical and biological adaptations such as skin colour, disease resistance, and lactose tolerance, but also personality and cognitive adaptations that {{are starting to}} emerge from genetic research. These may include tendencies towards (for example) reduced physical strength, enhanced long-term planning, or increased docility, all of {{which may have been}} counter-productive in hunter-gatherer societies, but become favoured adaptations in a world of agriculture and its resulting trade, governments and urbanization. These adaptations are even more important in the modern world, and have helped shape today's nation states. The authors speculate that the scientific and Industrial Revolutions came about in part due to genetic changes in Europe over the past millennium, the absence of which had limited the progress of science in Ancient Greece. The authors suggest <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to see fewer adaptive changes among the Amerindians and sub-Saharan Africans, who have farmed for the shortest times and were genetically isolated from older civilizations by geographical barriers. In groups that had remained foragers, such as the Australian Aborigines, there would presumably be no such adaptations at all. This may explain why Indigenous Australians and many Native Americans have characteristic health problems when exposed to modern Western diets. Similarly, Amerindians, Aboriginals, and Polynesians, for example, had experienced very little infectious disease. They had not evolved immunities as did many Old World dwellers, and were decimated upon contact with the wider world.|$|E

5000|$|Now let's {{consider}} the situation classically and {{imagine that the}} system transited from [...] to [...] via an intermediate state [...] Then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> classically <b>expect</b> the probability of the two-step transition to be {{the sum of all}} the possible intermediate steps.

500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect,</b> from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the Prince George Citizen by citizen staff, {{three days after}} the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, [...] "the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect,</b> there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Suppose {{we start}} with one {{electron}} at a certain place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label A) and a photon at another place and time (given the label B). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: 'What is the probability of finding an electron at C (another place and a later time) and a photon at D (yet another place and time)?'. The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from B to D (another elementary action). From {{a knowledge of the}} probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes – E(A to C) and P(B to D) – then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated overall probability amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability. [...] But there are other ways in which the end result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time E where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at F; then move on to C where it is detected, [...] while the new photon moves on to D. The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes – one emission and one absorption. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of E and F. We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for E and F. (This is not elementary in practice, and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to G where it emits a photon which goes on to D, while the electron moves on to H, where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to C. Again we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points G and H). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to our original simple estimate. Incidentally the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.|$|E
30|$|Hypothesis 2 : Neuroticism and its facets {{are more}} {{associated}} with rumination, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety than subjective well-being components. Except for negative affect, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> life satisfaction and positive affect correlate higher with rumination, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety than neuroticism facets.|$|R
30|$|Fourth, {{the finding}} that admiration and adoration are {{unrelated}} to pride probably is limited to pride in oneself. If we had assessed pride in someone else in addition to pride in oneself, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>expected</b> to see positive correlations of admiration and adoration with pride in others.|$|R
25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{distinct}} from this—it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> her to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{counting}} the number [...] of trials before r failures, the expected {{total number of}} trials of a negative binomial distribution with parameters [...] is r/(1nbsp&−nbsp&p).

50|$|Given the above, it {{is clear}} that there is an analogy between real options and {{financial}} options, and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> therefore <b>expect</b> options-based modelling and analysis to be applied here. At the same time, it is nevertheless important to understand why the more standard valuation techniques may not be applicable for ROV.|$|R
50|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{distinct}} from this because a superconductor expels all magnetic fields, not just those that are changing.

If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits {{that they might be}} quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related?

2500|$|It {{is typical}} {{for a given}} {{biological}} function {{to be controlled by}} a single mechanism that is capable of sensing the germane conditions and then executing the necessary function [...] The mechanism signals all the systems and tissues that need to respond to that function by means of organism-wide signals (hormones). If ageing is indeed a biological function, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> all or most manifestations of ageing to be similarly controlled by a common mechanism. Various observations (listed below) indeed suggest the existence of a common control mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more mundane}} {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} invention of the rifle inevitably led to an increase in accidents while hunting.

With the exception of one version in Scotland, the song has been found only in England, Ireland, USA, Australia and Canada.

30|$|In our study, the wrentit {{decreased}} in abundance {{after the fire}} in the low-elevation coastal sage scrub. Stanton (1986) observed 125 wrentits in unburned coastal sage scrub, but none in burned areas, exhibiting a highly significant preference for the former. The wrentit depends on medium to high levels of cover for foraging and nesting (Unitt 1984). As our results showed, fire typically reduces shrub cover in coastal sage scrub. This vegetation type is no longer suitable for wrentits and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> them to persist in a burned patch within the first few years after a fire. Likewise, the bushtit decreased after fire in our study. Stanton (1986) also found bushtits to prefer unburned areas. The bushtit shares many life history traits and requirements with the wrentit and, likewise, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> it to prosper in areas recently denuded of shrub or tree cover.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the {{continuity}} of observable variables, one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> there to be continuity in predetermined variables at the treatment cut-off.

If the outcome of interest is future grades, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>expect</b> the scholarship to affect earlier grades. If a discontinuity in predetermined variables is present at the treatment cut-off, then this puts the validity of the regression discontinuity design into question.|$|R
