50|$|An {{important}} aspect of plastic <b>welding</b> <b>rod</b> design and manufacture is the porosity of the material. A high porosity will lead to air bubbles (known as voids) in the rods, which decrease {{the quality of the}} welding. The highest quality of plastic <b>welding</b> <b>rods</b> are therefore those with zero porosity, which are called voidless.|$|R
50|$|In arc welding, an {{electrode}} is used {{to conduct}} current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together.

For a direct current system, the <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder, the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.|$|E

Four welded specimen plates were made; two plates {{for each type of}} <b>weld</b> <b>rod.</b> One plate from each of the 308 L and 8 N 12 weldings was thermally cycled 50 times between 366 K and 89 K while the two remaining plates were not thermally cycled.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 41) 6061 aluminum is a precipitation hardenable alloy that is {{used extensively}} in structural applications. Large ring shaped parts fabricated from 6061 are often rolled from annealed flat stock. A welding operation is required to join {{the ends of the}} part after shaping. The part is then precipitation hardened to bring the 6061 alloy up to the T 6 condition. Unfortunately, the weld metals commonly used to join 6061 do not achieve the same hardness as the parent metal in the T 6 condition. In this study the effects of <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> type, welding procedure, and postweld heat treatments were examined. Four different weld rods were used to join 6061 samples. The welding was done with and without a water chi lied fixture attached to the specimens being welded. Welded specimens were aged using ten different heat treatment cycles that included 9900 F or 9700 F solution treatments and natural or artificial aging at 3200 F or 3500 F. The 6061 parent material relies on a Magnesium Silicide precipitate for hardening effects. Three of the weld rods used, (X 4643, 5356, & 5556), have similar AI-Mg-Si alloy constituents. The fourth rod, 4043, is a AI-Si alloy. The X 4643 <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> was the only weld alloy to match the T 6 condition of the 6061 parent metal after aging. This occurred only in the water chilled case where the chill minimizes melting of the parent material during the welding process and increases the solidification rate of the weld metal. The appearant effect of the chill is to promote a finer dendritic structure...|$|E

According to Ron Dittemore, Space Shuttle Program Manager, the STS- 103 team delayed the launch because they need extra time to check one vendor's manufacturing processes, after an x-ray inspection revealed that an improper <b>weld</b> <b>rod</b> was used to weld one of the pressuring lines (called NPS lines) in the ET (external tank). Mr. Dittemore explained that since {{it is in the}} ET (not a major load carrying structure and rebuild after each flight), it did not pose any danger to the STS- 103 flight. However, the same vendor also manufactured some parts of the orbiter and the team {{wanted to make sure that}} the quality of the vendor's manufacturing processes is robust before launching the orbiter to space.

40|$|A spent nuclear fuels (SNF) {{repackaging}} {{and storage}} facility {{was designed for}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), with nuclear solid waste processing capability. Nuclear solid waste included contaminated or potentially contaminated spent fuel containers, associated hardware, machinery parts, light bulbs, tools, PPE, rags, swabs, tarps, <b>weld</b> <b>rod,</b> and HEPA filters. Design of the nuclear solid waste processing facilities included consideration of contractual, regulatory, ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) exposure, economic, logistical, and space availability requirements. The design also included non-attended transfer methods between the fuel packaging area (FPA) (hot cell) and the waste processing area. A monitoring system was designed for use within the FPA of the facility, to pre-screen the most potentially contaminated fuel canister waste materials, according to contact- or non-contact-handled capability. Fuel canister waste materials which {{are not able to}} be contact-handled after attempted decontamination will be processed remotely and packaged within the FPA. Noncontact- handled materials processing includes size-reduction, as required to fit into INEEL permitted containers which will provide sufficient additional shielding to allow contact handling within the waste areas of the facility. The current design, which satisfied all of the requirements, employs mostly simple equipment and requires minimal use of customized components. The waste processing operation also minimizes operator exposure and operator attendance for equipment maintenance. Recently, discussions with the INEEL indicate that large canister waste materials can possibly be shipped to the burial facility without size-reduction. New waste containers would have to be designed to meet the drop tests required for transportation packages. The SNF waste processing facilities could then be highly simplified, resulting in capital equipment cost savings, operational time savings, and significantly improved ALARA exposure...|$|E
