50|$|Vader had {{originally}} won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match twice, first by countout (after he press-slammed Michaels onto the guard rail) {{and then by}} disqualification (<b>when</b> <b>Michaels</b> struck Vader repeatedly with Cornette's tennis racket), but because WWF championships can only change hands by pinfall or submission, Cornette demanded that the match restart both times.

5|$|After {{relative}} stability {{at the senior}} executive level for three decades, there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 and 2003. The current GM is Jim Popp who was appointed {{at the end of}} 207 February 2017.

5|$|In a plan {{to unite}} the employees, Michael unintentionally embarrasses {{overweight}} new employee Tony Gardner (Mike Bruner) by attempting to push him onto a table {{with the rest of}} the new employees, making the whole arrangement awry; this causes Tony to quit. However, an angered Michael fires him instead, also unintentionally entitling him to severance pay. <b>When</b> <b>Michael</b> learns that Jim is the No. 2 in the office, Dwight and Andy argue over who is No. 3. They find that they have a common interest: their apparent fondness towards Michael.|$|E
5|$|In {{all of its}} history, {{the only}} {{case in which a}} Guyanese athlete has medaled at the Olympics was <b>when</b> <b>Michael</b> Anthony won a bronze medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. The size of Guyana's {{delegation}} peaked at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when it sent ten athletes, but (as of Beijing) had never risen past seven athletes other than in the 1980s. In Beijing, swimmer Niall Roberts bore Guyana's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post {{on the way to}} the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, <b>when</b> <b>Michael</b> was age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Michaels {{left the}} series to explore other opportunities. He was {{replaced}} by Jean Doumanian, who {{was replaced by}} Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, <b>when</b> <b>Michaels</b> returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera.

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has one task: sign routine documents. Unfortunately, it's a month {{where three}} {{separate}} sets of paperwork are due {{at the same}} time, so Michael mulishly ignores his workload. To procrastinate, Michael makes Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) update emergency contact information of the staff. <b>When</b> <b>Michael</b> gets Ryan's cell phone number, he constantly prank calls Ryan with crude impersonations of Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson, and Saddam Hussein.|$|E

5|$|On the January 29 {{episode of}} Raw, Michaels {{captured}} the World Tag Team Championship with WWE Champion John Cena after defeating Rated-RKO.

At WrestleMania 23, Cena retained the championship, after he made Michaels submit to the STFU. The next night on Raw, Michaels and Cena competed in two back-to-back ten team battle royals, winning the first and losing the titles in the second to The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) <b>when</b> <b>Michaels</b> threw Cena over the top rope. Michaels' feud with Cena continued and he faced off with Cena, Edge and Randy Orton in a Fatal Four-Way Match at Backlash for the WWE Championship.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Michael</b> {{finds out}} about Kevin's predicament, he gives Kevin his condolences, but subtly remains bitter that Kevin is ruining his {{birthday}} fun.

After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily, the Byzantine emperor, Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071â€“1078), betrothed {{his son to}} Robert Guiscard's daughter. <b>When</b> <b>Michael</b> was deposed, Robert took this {{as an excuse to}} invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium, but his fleet was {{defeated}} by the Venetians. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing, which broke and fled. Varangian mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman knights in the centre attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it, causing the bulk of the Byzantine army to rout.|$|E

5|$|His {{rule over}} Wallachia {{began in the}} autumn of 1593. Two years later, war with the Ottomans began, a {{conflict}} in which the Prince fought the Battle of CÄƒlugÄƒreni, {{considered one of the most}} important battles of his reign. Although the Wallachians emerged victorious from the battle, Michael was forced to retreat with his troops and wait for aid from his allies, Prince Sigismund BÃ¡thory of Transylvania and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half. Peace was again reached in late 1599, <b>when</b> <b>Michael</b> was unable to continue the war due to lack of support from his allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, <b>when</b> <b>Michael</b> Roberts was principal, {{the college}} {{accounts}} record payment {{for construction of}} a ball court. This was {{to the west of}} the principal's garden (which is to the north of the lodgings, alongside Ship Street), between a privy, stables, and the wall of the garden. Ball courts, bowling greens and groves were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than indulge in forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across the north of the garden.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{maintained}} his {{lead on the}} restart, followed by Martin and Gordon. Also, the second caution was prompted <b>when</b> <b>Michael</b> Waltrip damaged his car on that restart, Brad Keselowski was hit from behind and David Ragan spun sideways. None of the leaders chose to make pit stops, as the clean-up crew came on track to clear debris and fluids. Johnson held the lead at the lap 127 restart. Gordon accelerated slower than the leaders and dropped to sixth position by the next lap. On lap 129, Kyle Busch and Gordon made contact, but both managed to continue, without damaging their cars. By the next lap, Hamlin passed Martin for second position. On lap 134, Johnson had a 1.5 second lead, as Clint Bowyer moved into the fifth position. By the 138th lap, Johnson's lead was increased to 2 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|Michael survived Nikephoros' {{disastrous}} {{campaign against}} Krum of Bulgaria, {{and was considered}} a more appropriate candidate for the throne than his severely injured brother-in-law Staurakios. <b>When</b> <b>Michael's</b> wife Prokopia failed to persuade her brother to name Michael as his successor, a group of senior officials (the magistros Theoktistos, the Domestic of the Schools Stephen, and Patriarch Nikephoros) forced Staurakios to abdicate in his favor on 2 October 811.|$|R
50|$|Michaels {{served as}} the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Gifford for a two-man booth in 1986. During that season, the Miami Dolphins again made records with the biggest blowout in Monday Night Football history in a 45-3 rout of the then 10-1 New York Jets (the record was later tied and {{subsequently}} broken in 2005; see below). Also in 1986, <b>when</b> Al <b>Michaels</b> became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's League Championship Series, Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while Lynn Swann or O.J. Simpson filled-in as the color commentator. Gifford would once again call the play-by-play <b>when</b> <b>Michaels</b> was busy calling the World Series in 1987 and 1989 and the National League Championship Series in 1988.|$|R
