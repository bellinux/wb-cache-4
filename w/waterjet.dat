25|$|The first <b>waterjet</b> {{propelled}} Patrol Gunboat Hydrofoil Tucumcari (PGH-2) {{was built}} for operation by the Navy {{at a cost of}} $4 million by a Boeing subcontractor in Tacoma, Washington, and then assembled and outfitted at a Boeing facility in Seattle. Boeing's previous US Navy operated hydrofoil was the Patrol Craft Hydrofoil USS High Point (PCH-1), which utilized two forward hydrofoils and propellers on an aft-mounted single foil. Before that, Boeing had built and operated several hydroplane and hydrofoil test craft for itself and for the Navy.|$|E
40|$|The paper reviews {{recent work}} at the University of Missouri-Rolla {{in the use of}} high {{pressure}} <b>waterjets</b> for use in cutting rock. While the ability of <b>waterjets</b> as a means of rock excavation has been established over many years, in most instances it is more practical to combine their use with other techniques. Currently the most effective combinations are the use of <b>waterjets</b> with mechanical cutting tools, and the use of abrasive particles entrained in the jet stream. Full face excavation with <b>waterjets</b> alone requires, however, an excessively high level of input energy (although in softer rock and for some aspects of civil engineering they can be effective). For larger diameter openings a strategy is required in which the jet creates the free surfaces to which a larger volume of rock can be effectively removed by other means. The combination of polycrystalline diamond tipped tools and <b>waterjets</b> is shown to be an effective combination, since the optimum levels of performance of each co [...] ...|$|R

25|$|While most {{cephalopods}} {{can move}} by jet propulsion, {{this is a}} very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propellor-driven <b>waterjet</b> (i.e. Froude efficiency) is a more efficient model than rocket efficiency. The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.|$|E

5000|$|While not {{effective}} for the XB-70 project, {{the concept was}} valid and further research continued to evolve <b>waterjet</b> cutting. In 1962, Philip Rice of Union Carbide explored using a pulsing <b>waterjet</b> at up to [...] to cut metals, stone, and other materials. Research by S.J. Leach and G.L. Walker in the mid-1960s expanded on traditional coal <b>waterjet</b> cutting to determine ideal nozzle shape for high-pressure <b>waterjet</b> cutting of stone, and Norman Franz in the late 1960s focused on <b>waterjet</b> cutting of soft materials by dissolving long chain polymers in the water to improve the cohesiveness of the jet stream. In the early 1970s, the desire to improve the durability of the <b>waterjet</b> nozzle led Ray Chadwick, Michael Kurko, and Joseph Corriveau of the Bendix Corporation {{to come up with}} the idea of using corundum crystal to form a <b>waterjet</b> orifice, while Norman Franz expanded on this and created a <b>waterjet</b> nozzle with an orifice as small as 0.002 in that operated at pressures up to [...] John Olsen, along with George Hurlburt and Louis Kapcsandy at Flow Research (later Flow Industries), further improved the commercial potential of the <b>waterjet</b> by showing that treating the water beforehand could increase the operational life of the nozzle.|$|E
50|$|As <b>waterjet</b> cutting {{moved into}} {{traditional}} manufacturing shops, controlling the cutter reliably and accurately was essential. Early <b>waterjet</b> cutting systems adapted traditional {{systems such as}} mechanical pantographs and CNC systems based on John Parsons’ 1952 NC milling machine and running G-code. Challenges inherent to <b>waterjet</b> technology revealed the inadequacies of traditional G-Code, as accuracy depends on varying {{the speed of the}} nozzle as it approaches corners and details. Creating motion control systems to incorporate those variables became a major innovation for leading <b>waterjet</b> manufacturers in the early 1990s, with Dr John Olsen of OMAX Corporation developing systems to precisely position the <b>waterjet</b> nozzle while accurately specifying the speed at every point along the path, and also utilizing common PCs as a controller. The largest <b>waterjet</b> manufacturer, Flow International (a spinoff of Flow Industries), recognized the benefits of that system and licensed the OMAX software, with the result {{that the vast majority of}} <b>waterjet</b> cutting machines worldwide are simple to use, fast, and accurate.|$|E

40|$|Achieving reliable, high {{performance}} and cost effective manoeuvring {{control is a}} difficult issue facing designers of vessels that must operate in both high speed transit and dynamically positioned modes. On crew boats that service offshore platforms, the main drive propulsion system is also called upon {{to act as a}} set of thrusters for station keeping under manual and automatic control. Traditionally, vessels with multiple propellers and rudders, together with one or more bow thrusters have achieved good efficiency during transit combined with acceptable manoeuvring performance. More recently, <b>waterjets</b> have offered a viable alternative for this role, and these are seeing increased use in crew boat designs because of a number of inherent advantages. With superior power absorption under bollard pull conditions and rapid thrust vectoring through high speed reverse and steering actuation, <b>waterjets</b> are ideal for station keeping on relatively lightweight and quick responding vessels. When in transit, the ability of <b>waterjets</b> to absorb full engine power irrespective of the state of vessel loading, means that significantly higher speeds can be achieved when running light.
