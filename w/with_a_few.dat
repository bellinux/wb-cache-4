30|$|An {{analysis}} of a relationship between mentalization and cognitive function tests during depression {{did not find any}} correlations between mentalization and the Digit Span Test. On the other hand, 32 correlations were obtained between the four mentalization tests and the results of the TMT and WCST. A higher level of general mentalization was associated with better cognitive planning and efficiency of thinking, as well as <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> number of errors and perseverative responses in WCST. A better performance on the Faux Pas Recognition Test was connected with psychomotor speed, visual perception, visual–spatial coordination, and working memory. A higher level of cognitive mentalization was associated with better cognitive planning and efficiency of thinking (except for FPR), <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> number of errors and perseverative responses in WCST (R-MET and SS) and with psychomotor speed, visual perception, and visual–spatial coordination, and working memory (MSP). A higher level of affective mentalization was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> number of errors and a higher percentage of conceptual responses in WCST (R-MET, FPR).|$|R
