5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistan Navy and almost its entire fleet was based in Karachi Harbour. Since Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, a blockade <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for Pakistan’s economy. The security of Karachi Harbour was predominant to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes. The port's airspace was secured by the strike aircraft based at airfields in the area.|$|E

5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; {{and a handful of}} the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} countries, the United Kingdom {{definition}} of a drought is much less severe.

25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{found itself}} {{bound by the}} Westminster Convention and entered the war on the Prussian side. Newcastle was deeply {{reluctant}} to do this, but he saw that a Prussian collapse <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> to British and Hanoverian interests. The Anglo-Prussian Alliance was established, which saw large amounts of subsidy given to Prussia. Some supporters of George II were strong advocates of support for Prussia, as they saw {{it would be impossible}} to defend his realm of Hanover if they were to be defeated. Despite his initial dislike of Frederick, the King later moved towards this viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|From 1910 he was {{regarded}} as the nominal leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) in Southern Ireland, while Sir Edward Carson led the party in Ulster (the Ulster Unionist Council). He was a remote and condescending leader who relied on a few intimates and was suspected of being more interested in a future career in British conservative politics than in his Irish followers. In 1916 Midleton's lobbying helped to defeat an attempt to implement immediate Home Rule with Ulster exclusion; this {{was supported by the}} Ulster leader Edward Carson and the Home Ruler John Redmond, but Midleton believed it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for the Southern Unionist minority.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark (completed 1997) and the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, {{provided}} a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the Jutland Peninsula, precisely the Zealand). The undersea tunnel of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships {{into and out}} of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution.|$|E
25|$|Harold Macmillan's Government was {{encouraged}} to become involved on British Aluminium's side (he knew both Portal and Stedeford well), but declined, realising that change was needed and that any intervention {{on the side of}} British Aluminium <b>would</b> <b>be</b> politically <b>disastrous,</b> in light of Portal's total disregard of his investors' best interests.|$|R

25|$|After {{three years}} of bloody and {{inconclusive}} fighting, Confederate authorities were becoming desperate as the U.S. presidential election approached {{in the fall of}} 1864. Although the fortunes of war had largely favored the South prior to 1863, events were now starting to favor the Union. In the Eastern Theater, Ulysses S. Grant had Robert E. Lee pinned down in the Siege of Petersburg; Jubal Early had been driven back from the outskirts of Washington, D.C., while Philip Sheridan was now pursuing him in the Shenandoah Valley; and William T. Sherman had captured Atlanta. With foreign recognition for the Confederacy not forthcoming, Southerners realized that President Abraham Lincoln's re-election <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for their cause, especially as Lincoln's primary opponent, George McClellan, had campaigned on the promise of conciliating the South with offers of peace.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Berthold's {{eyesight}} returned. He {{was unable}} to fly for four months, but remained in charge of KEK Vaux. Between the message traffic brought to him, and the accounts of his visiting subordinates, he learned of ongoing casualties. His brother Wolfram {{had been killed in}} action as an infantryman on 29 April. Max Immelmann perished in battle on 18 June. After Immelmann's death, Germany's highest scoring ace, Oswald Boelcke, was removed from flying for fear that his loss in action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> to morale. In the meantime, Berthold was scheduled to be evacuated back to Germany, away from the front. Instead, in late July, he commandeered a car and returned to his unit. Although unable to fly because of a stiff knee, he could still command. He made his orderly help him bend his knee and flex strength back into his withered leg.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Browning read Daphne du Maurier's novel The Loving Spirit and, {{impressed}} by its graphic {{depictions of the}} Cornish coastline, set out to see it for himself in Ygdrasil. Afterwards, he left the boat moored in the River Fowey for the winter, but returned in April 1932 to collect it. He heard that {{the author of the}} book that had impressed him so much was convalescing from an appendix operation, and invited her out on his boat. [...] After a short romance, he proposed to her but she rejected this, as she did not believe in marriage. Dorman-Smith then went to see her and explained that their living together without marriage <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for Browning's career. Du Maurier then proposed to Browning, who accepted. They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow, Lanteglos-by-Fowey on 19 July 1932, and honeymooned on Ygdrasil. Their marriage produced three children: two daughters, Tessa and Flavia, and a son, Christian, known as Kits.|$|E
500|$|For {{shooting}} the flood scene, a farmer agreed to flood [...] of his land. In the exodus scene following the flood, 300bullock carts, 200farmers and many horses, tractors and ploughs were used. Gayatri Chatterjee {{writes about the}} popular belief that all these were made available by villagers without reimbursement, in her book. However, account ledgers of the production revealed that the villagers were paid. There was a protracted scene in the film in which Radha runs between burning haystacks in search for her son Birju, a renegade bandit, who was hiding there. The fire scene {{was shot in the}} Umra area of Surat, Gujarat, by burning bales of hay. Nargis and Dutt acted in the fire scene without doubles. On 1 March 1957, an accident occurred during the fire scene when the wind direction changed and the fire grew out of control, trapping Nargis. She was saved by Dutt, who quickly grabbed a blanket, plunged inside, and rescued her. Shooting halted temporarily as both had sustained injuries. Dutt was hospitalised for the burns and Nargis helped nurse him, at Khan's place in Billimora. Nargis—a popular actress at the time—fell in love with Dutt, who was in early stages of his film career and played her son in the film; they married on 11 March 1958. Nargis wished to marry soon after the film, but Khan protested that real-life marriage of the onscreen mother-son <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>disastrous</b> for the film. Owing to their relationship, Nargis also found it difficult to perform a scene where she beat Dutt with a lathi.|$|E

25|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to train a child for a WISC test or other gifted test. Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information.
