25|$|In August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's {{religious}} discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It {{was determined that}} as an unpaid {{research associate at the}} Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.|$|E
25|$|With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein {{took part}} in an {{interview}} with CBS News reporter Dan Rather. Talking for more than three hours, he denied possessing any weapons of mass destruction, or any other weapons prohibited by UN guidelines. He also expressed a wish to have a live televised debate <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> which was declined. It was his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade. CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction in}} order to appear strong against Iran.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama {{had clearly}} forged a good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor her husband would upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> James Baker with George H. W. Bush, or Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.|$|E

The spokesman said, [...] "I thought the interpretation that was put on Douglas Alexander's words was quite extraordinary.

500|$|Clinton {{left office}} with the highest end-of-office {{approval}} rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and he has continually received high ratings in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, Clinton {{has been involved in}} public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife's presidential campaigns and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life.

500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift you out of the dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E

500|$|With {{only two}} weeks {{remaining}} before the primary, a Quinnipiac University poll released May 4 showed Specter's lead against Sestak had significantly narrowed, dropping from 53-32 percent in the previous month to 47-39 percent. A daily tracking poll by Muhlenberg College showed the race as even closer, with Specter supported by 46 percent of likely voters surveyed, and Sestak trailing only four points at 42 percent. The Quinnipiac poll indicated the strongest factor in these changes was that Sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials. According to the poll, 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him, compared to only 33 percent in March. The day after the poll was released, Sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of Specter, highlighting the incumbent Senator's Republican history and showing images of him <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The commercial featured a clip of Specter saying, [...] "My change in party will enable me to be reelected" [...] and ended with a narrator saying, [...] "Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job: his, not yours." [...] The same week the advertisement ran, T.J. Rooney {{said in an interview}} with Politico that a Sestak primary victory would be [...] "cataclysmic" [...] for the party in the general election, and warned Democratic voters, [...] "If we want to keep this seat in Democratic hands, the only person capable of delivering that victory is Arlen Specter." ...|$|E

Early speculation had Republicans Greg Davis, Glenn McCullough, and Randy Russell and Democrats Steve Holland and Jamie Franks as contenders. All but Franks ended up as candidates.|$|E

2500|$|Rumsfeld recounts his {{distance}} from George H. W. Bush during the Ford and Reagan administrations, which ranged from differences in opinion for appointments and political endorsements {{as well as}} personal differences. He describes himself as skeptical of the experiences of [...] "those who enjoy the inherited benefit of prominent names." [...] However, he ends up forging a close relationship <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush.</b> Rumsfeld labels the younger Bush [...] "decidedly down-to-earth, with no inclination to formality" [...] with a [...] "demeanor... different from his father’s somewhat patrician manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{prolonged}} parliamentary {{debates in the}} run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq he voiced strong opposition to the UK's participation. In the aftermath of the war, he lent support to the attempt of Adam Price, a Plaid Cymru MP, to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq issue. Salmond has gone further than many anti-war politicians in claiming that Blair's statements on the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq were consciously intended to deceive the public. He has also claimed that Blair had made a pact <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> [...] "to go to war come what may".|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 John Paul II criticised the 2003 US-led {{invasion}} of Iraq, saying in his State of the World address [...] "No to war! War {{is not always}} inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity." [...] He sent Pío Cardinal Laghi, the former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States, to talk <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> the American President, to express opposition to the war. John Paul II {{said that it was}} up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. The pope's opposition to the Iraq War led to him being a candidate to win the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, which was ultimately awarded to Iranian attorney/judge and noted human rights advocate, Shirin Ebadi.|$|E

2500|$|A third, {{politically}} charged clip was later posted, with the titles [...] "Guess Who Batman" [...] and later [...] "Get with the Brogram", finally appearing as [...] "GWB". Despite both working titles sharing initials <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> Allen wrote that [...] "this song {{is not a}} direct attack at anyone, it was originally written about the BNP in the UK but then I felt this issue has become relevant pretty much everywhere, we are the youth, we can make coolness for our future, its up to us. Go green and hate hate." [...] The song was retitled [...] "Fuck You" [...] for the album version. Allen posted a fourth song on her Myspace page, called [...] "Who'd of Known", noting that the song had been recorded for the album but would not be included due to legal issues since the chorus is musically similar to the Take That song [...] "Shine". However, Take That later did allow Allen to include the song on the album (now titled grammatically correctly as [...] "Who'd Have Known").|$|E
2500|$|Their party {{independence}} {{continued into}} 2000, and Catholics became the large religious grouping that most closely reflected the total electorate, ahead of mainline Protestants. 50% of Catholics voted for Al Gore versus 47% for George W.

[...] Among white Catholics, the Republicans won by a substantial margin. 52% of Catholics voted for Bush's successful reelection compared to 47% for the Catholic John Kerry in 2004, versus 51% to 48% overall. [...] Amongst white Catholics the figure was higher, <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W</b> <b>Bush</b> receiving 56% of white Catholic votes. Barack Obama, who chose the Catholic Joe Biden as his running mate, received 54% of the Catholic vote in 2008 compared to John McCain's 45%, close to the overall 52% to 46%. In 2012 Obama and Biden faced Mitt Romney and the Catholic Paul Ryan. Obama won 50% of the Catholic vote to Romney's 48%, close to their 51% and 47%, respectively, of the overall vote. In 2016 the Republicans' Donald Trump chose Mike Pence—who describes himself as evangelical Catholic—as his running mate, while the Democrats' Hillary Clinton chose the Catholic Tim Kaine as hers.

2500|$|Several {{people have}} drawn a {{parallel}} between Voldemort and some politicians. Rowling has admitted that Voldemort was [...] "a sort of" [...] Adolf Hitler, {{and that there}} is some parallel with Nazism in her books. Rowling also compared Voldemort with Joseph Stalin, with whom he shares several traits, including that of renouncing his family name in favour of one which would invoke fear and strength. Alfonso Cuarón, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban compared Voldemort <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> and Saddam Hussein, as the two of them [...] "...have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people." [...] Andrew Slack and the Harry Potter Alliance compare media consolidation in the U.S. to Voldemort's regime in Deathly Hallows and its control over the Daily Prophet and other media saying that [...] "Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the wizarding world, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called 'Potterwatch'. Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press." [...] Julia Turner from Slate Magazine also noted similarities between the events of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the current War on Terror. She said that Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders.|$|E
