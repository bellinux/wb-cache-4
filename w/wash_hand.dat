The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of hands free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora on hands. Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with hands free basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and hands free hand basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, Hands free mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or hands free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of hand washing, types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins available for the study.

Product samples collected from slaughtering house showed the presence of Salmonella sp. in spleen (4 / 40, 10. 0 %), small intestine (9 / 40, 22. 5 %). Liver (5 / 40, 12. 5 %), lungs (3 / 40, 7. 5 %) and lymph nodes (16 / 40, 40. 0 %). Salmonella sp. were recovered from slaughtering tables (3 / 15, 20. 0 %), <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins (4 / 15, 26. 7 %), butchering knife (2 / 13, 15. 4 %), workers hands (4 / 15, 26. 7 %), holden pens (3 / 15, 20. 0 %). These samples were cultured {{for the presence of}} Salmonella sp. Simple descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to analyze the data collected. Although clinical Salmonellosis was not detected in the study herd, multiple serotypes of Salmonella were found causing endemic infection in the study herd. The most frequently detected species was Salmonella cholereasuis and it was resistant to all the antibiotic used in sensitivity testing except polymyxin B. This result showed the necessity for adopting more effective hygienic measures in the abattoir environment and equipment to reduce their role in the spread of Salmonell a.

If more than 50 % of the groups exhibited a similar time pattern, then that set was assigned to clothes washer. The threshold value of 50 % was decided to allow the variation in time sequence due to the selection of different washing settings by the users (e.g. normal <b>wash,</b> <b>hand</b> wash or quick wash modes of the same washing machine will result in different time sequence). The actual verification process has also indicated that with the set that contains a group of user-dependent samples, the grouping rate is almost less than 10 %. The process has shown that {{three out of four}} time sequences (75 %) shown in Fig.  8 a were grouped together, which confirms the samples contained in Set 1 to be from clothes washer category.|$|E

Stratified random sampling method was applied to choose the schools and the study subjects. Semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the study subjects and microscopic examination of stool was done. The Chi-square test was used to measure the association of risk factors and intestinal helminthic infections. &# 13; Results: Overall intestinal helminthic infection was found to be 13 percent. Taenia species was found high (6. 5 %) in comparison to other worms i. e. Hookworm (3 %), Ascaris lumbricoides (2 %) and Trichuris trichiura (1. 5 %). The use of soap and water after defecation showed lower prevalence of helminthic infections (8 %) than only uses water (34. 2 %).

It {{is caused by}} an obligate, intracellular tissues cyst-forming protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, with domestic cat and other felides as definitive hosts. The infection has aroused considerable interest from various workers because of the dangers it poses and its mode oftransmission. Materials and Methods: Sera collected from 75 volunteered abattoir workers were analysed using Toxo-Latex kit by LINEAR chemicals (Cromatest, Jeanquim Costa, Barcelona, Spain) which is a rapid slide agglutination procedure. In addition, some epidemiological factors were obtained from these volunteered through structural questionnaire administered to them. Results: The adolescent (16 - 20 years) had the highest prevalence (57. 1 %) while the elderly, aged > 60 years had prevalence of 50 %. No statistical significant different was however observed (p > 0. 05) varying degree of infarction was observed between the old groups. Sero-prevalence among workers who eat raw meat/suya, drink unpasteurized milk, smoking/eating when evisceration were 50 %, 26. 7 %, 13. 8 %, 13. 8 % and 20 % respectively, while workers that do not eat/drink during evisceration was 13. 3 %.

ABSTRACT: In a cross-sectional study, the prevalence of intestinal parasites infection and its association with socio-economic factors were explored among children aged 0 to 15 years hospitalized in Moulay Abdellah Hospital in Salé province (Morocco). The study was conducted from June 2012 to May 2013. A total of 200 stool samples were examined by direct microscopic examination in physiological saline and iodine, an enrichment method Ballenger and MIF. A questionnaire for common risks factors was completed for each participant. Mono or poly-parasitisme was detected in 69 (34, 5 %) of the children (26, 4 % of males and 41, 3 % of females). Various species of helminthes and protozoan infections were detected. Blastocystis hominis and Giardia intestinalis were detected in 14, 5 % and 12, 5 % respectively of examined samples. Others helminthes parasites included on the first Enterobius vermicularis with 3, 5 % cases, the second was Ascaris lumbricoides in 3 % and the third one was Taenia saginata with 1 %.
