This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules.

40|$|In various food products, the fat phase {{which is}} almost {{essentially}} composed of triacylglycerols is found in a crystallized form at temperature of use or of storage. The fat physical characteristics influence the rheological properties and {{the stability of the}} products. In food, the fat phase is frequently found in a dispersed form either as oil in <b>water</b> <b>emulsions</b> (ice cream, whipped topping) or as <b>water</b> in oil <b>emulsion</b> (butter, margarine). The mechanism of fat crystallisation is different in the bulk phase and in emulsified systems so that the fat behaviour in emulsion can not simply be deduced from that in the bulk phase. In particular, crystallization in emulsion depends on various parameters such as the fat globule size and the presence of surfactants (proteins and low molecular weight emulsifiers). Moreover, fat crystals {{play a major role in}} the emulsion stability, i. e., by stabilizing <b>water</b> in oil <b>emulsions</b> and destabilizing oil in <b>water</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Conversely, crystals are implied in the formation of a fat network of partially coalesced droplets that participates to the foam stabilization in aerated food products based on oil in <b>water</b> <b>emulsions...</b>|$|R

50|$|During the 1950s, {{experiments}} with silicone based defoamers started. These {{were based on}} polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil) dispersed in water or light oil.

These types of defoamers were very efficient, but the oil crisis of 1973 made these too expensive and resulted in a push for reduction of the oil content. The solution was adding water.

50|$|Emulsified Fuels are {{emulsions}} {{composed of}} water and a combustible liquid, either oil or a fuel. Emulsions are a particular example of a dispersion comprising a continuous and a dispersed phase. In the case of emulsions both phases are the immiscible liquids, oil and <b>water.</b> <b>Emulsion</b> fuels can be either a microemulsion or an ordinary emulsion (sometimes referred to as macroemulsion, to differentiate them from microemulsions). The essential {{differences between the two}} are stability (microemulsions are thermodynamically stable systems, whereas macroemulsions are kinetically stabilized) and particle size distribution (microemulsions are formed spontaneously and have dimensions of 10 to 200 nm, whereas macroemulsions are formed by a shearing process and have dimensions of 100 nm to over 1 micrometer). Microemulsions are isotropic whereas macroemulsions are prone to settling (or creaming) and changes in particle size over time. Both use surfactants (also called emulsifiers) and can be either water-in-oil (invert emulsions), or oil-in-water (regular emulsions) or bicontinuous (also called multiple or complex emulsions).|$|E
50|$|Mayonnaise is an oil in <b>water</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{which is}} stable at room {{temperature}} because it reaches phase equilibrium.

Butter is a water in oil emulsion with the water phase having a higher freezing point than oil. In the freezer, the small water droplets that are suspended in the continuous oil phase freeze in their specific locations while the rest of the oil stays in place. When the butter is needed, one only needs to take it out of the freezer and thaw it for the general properties of butter return as the water droplets melt in their respective locations. Mayonnaise is different; when oil in water emulsions are frozen, the continuous phase is water which freezes and allows the oil droplets to flocculate. This whole process causes a phase separation between the water and the oil.|$|E
