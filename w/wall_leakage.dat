As a complement and also to help identify the key parameters that influence the resulting leakage and failure probabilities, the application of Simulation Based Reliability Analysis is under development.

Devices for cross-flow microfiltration are composed of a duct, the walls of which are semi-permeable membranes. In subsurface irrigation, the walls of watering pipes can be of porous clay, whereas the watering hoses are riddled with holes or made of porous material, in surface drip irrigation.

40|$|International audienceGiven that {{airtightness}} {{is recognized}} as an essential issue for low-energy dwellings, today it is often included in energy performance (EP) calculations, frequently through single-zone models with uniform air leakage. Because more consideration is often given to EP than to indoor air quality issues, air leakage through internal partitions is often disregarded. Therefore, additional {{studies are needed to}} check these assumptions. In the present study air leakage through the building envelope and through internal partitions is investigated. This paper presents the methodology used in an experimental study, conducted to measure multizone air leakages, using the guarded zone pressurization technique. We developed a detailed innovative database with 456 exterior and internal partition <b>wall</b> air <b>leakage</b> measurements, taken in 23 detached houses. For each wall, the database includes general information on the building, special requirements, the building's main characteristics, measurement protocol, type of wall, measurement input data and measurement results (CL, n, q 50 and the reliability index developed). Then an analysis of this database is provided. The analysis reveals most important relationships. For instance, internal partition <b>wall</b> air <b>leakage</b> is not related to the envelope's airtightness level; instead, the type of building structure has greater influence. Through this study, we underline the impact on building airflows of more detailed modelling of internal and external air leakage in multizone approaches, with consequences on indoor air quality (IAQ) bedrooms where people spend most of their time. As a conclusion, we propose air leakage values and dispersion input data for multizone IAQ models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtracellular matrix {{proteins}} {{form the}} basic structure of blood vessels. Along with providing basic structural support to blood vessels, matrix proteins interact with different sets of vascular cells via cell surface integrin or non-integrin receptors. Such interactions induce vascular cell de novo synthesis of new matrix proteins during blood vessel development or remodeling. Under pathological conditions, vascular matrix proteins undergo proteolytic processing, yielding bioactive fragments to influence vascular wall matrix remodeling. Vascular cells also produce alternatively spliced variants that induce vascular cell production of different matrix proteins to interrupt matrix homeostasis, leading to increased blood vessel stiffness; vascular cell migration, proliferation, or death; or vascular <b>wall</b> <b>leakage</b> and rupture. Destruction of vascular matrix proteins leads to vascular cell or blood-borne leukocyte accumulation, proliferation, and neointima formation within the vascular wall; blood vessels prone to uncontrolled enlargement during blood flow diastole; tortuous vein development; and neovascularization from existing pathological tissue microvessels. Here we summarize discoveries related to blood vessel matrix proteins within the past decade from basic and clinical studies in humans and animals — from expression to cross-linking, assembly, and degradation under physiological and vascular pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysms, varicose veins, and hypertension...|$|E

40|$|Buried piping at some {{nuclear power}} plants has {{degraded}} {{to the point that}} through <b>wall</b> <b>leakage</b> has occurred. In a few cases this has led to releases of tritium into groundwater, which has generated significant stakeholder interest. Leaks from degraded buried piping are responsible for less than approximately 10 - 20 % of recently reported abnormal releases of tritium from {{nuclear power plants}}. The NRC staff, in SECY 09 - 0174 (ML 093160004), reviewed codes, standards, regulations and industry practices related to degradation of buried piping and identified a number of ongoing activities. This action plans tracks those activities. Background: Leaks from buried piping, particularly of tritiated water, have attracted significant stakeholder attention. For example, during 2009 buried piping leaks introduced water that contained low levels of tritium into the groundwater at Dresden, Oyster Creek and Peach Bottom nuclear plants. The levels of tritium did not exceed any NRC limits (that would be applicable on-site), and after additional dilution and decay that would occur as a natural consequence of migration toward the site boundary, would not exceed any NRC limit offsite. Although these leaks did not exceed any NRC limits, either on-site or offsite, the level of tritium triggered the licensees t...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{in detail}} {{the stability of the}} planned parking cavern in Hammerfest. It includes a review on recognized literature of support design for underground constructions, frost issues in tunnels, water inflow and mitigation, numerical modelling, and general stability of underground caverns. Studying the local and regional geology reviled that the rock mass is mainly composed of gneiss, with some small amount of quartzite. The rock mass is expected to be strong (RMR> 60, Q> 10) but encountering a zone of weak rock mass(Q< 0. 01) is anticipated. Two cases of underground facilities in Norway are reviewed with emphasis on key experiences, support requirement, and monitoring. Support needed for the Hammerfest parking cavern is suggested by analytical, empirical approaches. Finalized rock support measures are quantified and tested with numerical modelling. The cavern is expected to be sufficiently supported with rock bolts and shotcrete. However, if weak rock is encountered, reinforced shotcrete arches and spiling bolts will be needed. Kinematic assessment is carried out identifying possible failing wedges in the roof and <b>walls.</b> <b>Leakage</b> of water is discussed and consequences of draining surface ponds are evaluated. Some leakage is expected in the cavern based on field observations however, levels are generally anticipated as dripping. Ahead-of-face investigations are concluded necessary to identify possible high water conduction near the weak rock mass zone. There will be need for grouting should the water leakage exceed quantified limits given in the thesis. Frost intrusion to the cavern is modelled and discussed. It has been recognized that frost will enter the cavern and sufficient mitigation is suggested...|$|R

They described late leakage, which presented as abdominal-wall edema and responded to IPO. I would like to describe five patients with a late leakage, that presented externally. Their age was 45 to 57 (mean 51) years. One of the five had the Toronto Western HospitalII-catheter, three a single-cuff Tenckhoff, and one a double-cuff Tenckhoff catheter (5). This complication {{is said to be}} particularly common among CAPD patients with diabetes mellitus, with polycystic kidneys, and with previous abdominal operations (2, 4). None of our five patients had any of these conditions. As described in the literature treatment of this complication includes: a) Decrease in the dialysate volume, b) interruption of CAPO and transfer to hemodialysis, c) replacement of the catheter, d) removal of the catheter and implantation of a new one, e) CCPD with small volumes and f) transfer to IPD for seven to 10 days (3). In our patients, interruption of CAPO and institution oflPO for 10 to 14 days corrected this complication and the patients have been free of symptoms for an average period of six months. I propose that this approach is effective not only for late leakage manifesting as abdominal wall edema, but also for late external leakage...|$|E
40|$|Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes and microbleeds are {{regarded}} as typical MRI expressions of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and they are highly prevalent in the elderly. However, clinical expression of MRI defined SVD is generally moderate and heterogeneous. By reviewing studies that directly correlated postmortem MRI and histopathology, this paper aimed to characterise the pathological substrates of SVD {{in order to create}} more understanding as to its heterogeneous clinical manifestation. Summary: Postmortem studies showed that WMH are also heterogeneous in terms of histopathology. Damage to the tissue ranges from slight disentanglement of the matrix to varying degrees of myelin and axonal loss. Glial cell responses include astrocytic reactions - for example, astrogliosis and clasmatodendrosis - as well as loss of oligodendrocytes and distinct microglial responses. Lipohyalinosis, arteriosclerosis, vessel <b>wall</b> <b>leakage</b> and collagen deposition in venular walls are recognised microvascular changes. Suggested pathogenetic mechanisms are ischaemia/hypoxia, hypoperfusion due to altered cerebrovascular autoregulation, blood-brain barrier leakage, inflammation, degeneration and amyloid angiopathy. Only a few postmortem MRI studies have addressed lacunes and microbleeds to date. Cortical microinfarcts and changes in the normal appearing white matter are 'invisible' on conventional MRI but are nevertheless expected to contribute substantially to clinical symptoms. Conclusion: Pathological substrates of WMH are heterogeneous in nature and severity, which may partly explain the weak clinicoradiological associations found in SVD. Lacunes and microbleeds have been relatively understudied and need to be further investigated. Future studies should also take into account 'MRI invisible' SVD features and consider the use of, for example, quantitative MRI techniques, to increase the sensitivity of MRI for these abnormalities and study their effects on clinical functioning...|$|E

Little research on this topic focused on the collection of damage data, the understanding of damage mechanisms and the deepening of data analysis methods. In this paper, the relative contribution of different failure mechanisms to the occurrence of rainstorm damage is investigated, {{as well as the}} extent to which these mechanisms relate to weather variables. For a case study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a property level home insurance database of around 3100 water-related damage claims was analysed. The records include comprehensive transcripts of communication between insurer, insured and damage assessment experts, which allowed claims to be classified according to their actual damage cause. The results show that roof and <b>wall</b> <b>leakage</b> is the most frequent failure mechanism causing precipitation-related claims, followed by blocked roof gutters, melting snow and sewer flooding. Claims related to sewer flooding were less present in the data, but are associated with significantly larger claim sizes than claims in the majority class, i. e. roof and wall leakages. Rare events logistic regression analysis revealed that maximum rainfall intensity and rainfall volume are significant predictors for the occurrence probability of precipitation-related claims. Moreover, it was found that claims associated with rainfall intensities smaller than 7 – 8 mm in a 60 -min window are mainly related to failure processes in the private domain, such as roof and wall leakages. For rainfall events that exceed the 7 – 8 mm h − 1 threshold, the failure of systems in the public domain, such as sewer systems, start to contribute considerably to the overall occurrence probability of claims. The communication transcripts, however, lacked information to be conclusive about to which extent sewer-related claims were caused by overloading of sewer systems or failure of system components...|$|E

The teliospores of the pathogenic filamentous fungus Sporisorium scitamineum produces smut disease in non-resistant varieties of sugarcane. Two HMMG from smut-resistant varieties of sugarcane promote teliospore chemotaxis and agglutination, respectively. However, HMMG from by non-resistant varieties do not promote teliospore aggregation. Agglutination is a lectin-dependent response from the HMMG endowed with arginase activity that also inhibits teliospore germination. Conversely, dispersal of teliospore aggregates and loss of chemotaxis are induced by other glycoproteins from resistant cultivars after prolonged contact with the chemoattractant. This is accompanied by disassembly of the cell <b>wall</b> protoplast <b>leakage,</b> which is caused by hydrolytic enzymes, such as chitinase and β- 1, 4 - and β- 1, 3 -glucanases.

Ozone is produced when oxygen (O 2) molecules are dissociated by an energy source into oxygen atoms and subsequently collide with an oxygen molecule to form an unstable gas, ozone (O 3), which is used to disinfect wastewater. Most wastewater treatment plants generate ozone by imposing a high voltage alternating current (6 to 20 kilovolts) across a dielectric discharge gap that contains an oxygen-bearing gas. Ozone is generated onsite because it is unstable and decomposes to elemental oxygen in a short amount of time after generation. Ozone is a very strong oxidant and virucide.

3000|$|Accordingly, H 2 O 2 has {{the longest}} span life but the weakest {{oxidization}} capability {{among the three}} ROSs. This species, which dominated the Ag/TiO 2 photocatalysis, diffused into the cells without seriously damaging their cell structures. Consequently, the H 2 O 2 molecules permeated the cell membranes, damaging the spores’ interiors without excessively leaking their cell contents (as confirmed by the EEM and SEC results). However, the dominant ROS in Er 3 +:YAlO 3 /TiO 2 photocatalysis was h+, with the strongest oxidative potential but shortest life-span among the three ROSs. This species was generally produced {{on the surface of}} the catalyst and directly attacked the cell wall. The Er 3 +:YAlO 3 /TiO 2 nanoparticles then entered the cells through the broken cell <b>wall,</b> causing abundant <b>leakage</b> of the intracellular components and subsequent pollution of the bulk water quality. The N/TiO 2 photocatalysis was dominated by •O 2 [...]...|$|R
3000|$|LLT {{gasification}} method. This method utilizes mined tunnels or constructed roadways {{to connect}} the injection well to the production well [4]. Typical long and large tunnel (LLT) systems consist of a gasification channel, two auxiliary holes, and two auxiliary tunnels (Figure 2). The auxiliary holes are arranged between the injection and production wells and are used as malfunction holes for the injection of air and water vapor, or to discharge gas for added gasifier control. LLT also includes an auxiliary tunnel constructed of bricks, which is an auxiliary installation for air injection that prevents blockage in the gasification channel. The mined tunnels are isolated by sealing <b>walls</b> to prevent <b>leakage</b> of combustible gases from the gasifier [35]. The location and height of the oxidant injection points and gas outlet points can be adjusted, allowing for two-dimensional control of oxidant injection and gas production [28].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} composition of Rosmarinus officinalis L. essential oil (REO) was analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. The main compounds of the REO were 1. 8 cineole (52. 2 %), camphor (15. 2 %) and α-pinene (12. 4 %). The mycelial growth of Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg was reduced significantly by 150 μg/mL of REO. Significant microscopic morphological changes were visualised, such as the rupture of the cell <b>wall</b> and the <b>leakage</b> of cytoplasm at 300 μg/mL of REO. At lower concentrations of REO, the effects on the production of ergosterol and the biomass of mycelium varied, as did the effects on the production of fumonisins, but at ⩾ 300 μg/mL of REO, these processes were significantly inhibited, showing {{the effectiveness of the}} REO as an antifungal agent. The results suggested that the REO acts against F. verticillioides by disrupting the cell wall and causing the loss of cellular components, subsequently inhibiting the production of fumonisins and ergosterol...|$|R
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} {{effects of}} endotoxin shock were investigated in dogs {{by a combination}} of anatomic and physiologic technics. Shock was produced in 14 dogs by injecting Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide intravenously. Three dogs in hypovolemic shock and 6 untreated dogs served as controls. Colloidal carbon was injected intravenously to detect sites of pathologic increase in vascular permeability. During the first hour of endotoxin shock, bronchial venules allowed carbon and blood elements to traverse their <b>walls,</b> whereas no <b>leakage</b> of these large particles or ultrastructural changes could be detected in the alveolar walls. Only after the first hour was bronchial venular leakage accompanied by focal degenerative changes in the alveolar endothelium, focal interstitial edema in the alveolar septum and sequestration of damaged leukocytes in the alveolar capillaries. In contrast to these observations in endotoxin shock, control dogs in hypovolemic shock did not show bronchial venous leakage. Our findings suggest that the leakage of bronchial venules may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary interstitial edema caused by endotoxin shock...|$|R
