30|$|The {{normalized}} EL as {{a function}} of the emission <b>wavelength</b> (<b>nm)</b> of PLEDs with pure DBPPV, DB 2 –ZnO, DB 3 –ZnO and DB 4 –ZnO are shown in Fig. 2 b. We obviously found that for ZnO-doped DBPPV, the emission peak from the inter-chain vibration of DBPPV was reduced, which perhaps is the possible reason that the nanoparticles assist the polymer arrangement and reduce the conformational disorder of polymer in the emission layer, and then cause the probability for inter-chain emission of device to reduce. It is observed that the emission peak only takes place in the emission layer and no emission from the inorganic layer is observed for the DB–ZnO devices. At the DBPPV–ZnO layer, the barrier potential of ZnO for holes is about 2.2 eV. The mobility of electrons in the ZnO is higher than that of holes in the DBPPV layer [25]. So the recombination zone of electrons and holes is primarily restricted to the DBPPV. This is the reason that the emission from DBPPV and the emission from the ZnO are not observed in the DB–ZnO devices.|$|E

However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation may accelerate the oxidative stress, generating carcinogenesis and photoaging. Natural compounds and their applications {{are considered a}} trend in the cosmetic market. The protein-based film-forming compounds play an important role, once it collaborates for the better distribution of sunscreens on the skin. Here we investigated the in vitro photoprotective effectiveness of sunscreens containing the hydrolyzed collagen associated with UVA, UVB and/or inorganic filters. Sunscreens were developed with octocrylene (7. 5 %), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone) (3. 0 %) and/or titanium dioxide (5. 0 %), associated or not with the hydrolyzed collagen (3. 0 %).

This inadequate interaction may be considered during the development of new sunscreens intended to contain protein-based components...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a quantitative analysis of geographic color variation in {{two species of}} dung beetles: Geotrupes auratus and G. laevistriatus. The reflectance of the dorsal surfaces was measured from 300 to 700 nm using a spectrophotometer. The reflectance curves for both beetles were bimodal; there were two distinct peaks, namely, the α peak, between 400 and 700 nm, and the β peak at around 300 nm. A stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that geographic color variation in Geotrupes beetles was primarily characterized by a shift of the α peak. Using beetles from three locations, we compared the <b>wavelength</b> (<b>nm)</b> of the α peak (λmax(α)) and its reflectance intensity (R(α)) to investigate sex and population differences. Intraspecific geographic variation in coloration was effectively detected by discriminant analysis of spectral reflectance curves.

Our study also revealed hidden sex differences in R(α); R(α) of males {{were significantly higher than}} those of females in both species.

The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) is a very accurate way to analyze metals in solution; this paper investigated the optimal conditions for copper bioleaching by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans from flexible PCB through ICP-AES. The conditions included particle size of flexible PCB powder, quantity of flexible PCB powder, initial pH of culture medium, bacteria inoculation, bacteria activation time, and quantity of FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O.

So the aim of this study is Kinetic and isotherm study of methylene blue adsorption by powdered pumice from the aquatic environment. Methods: Adsorption process was investigated in vitro at neutral pH, a constant concentration of dye and adsorbent dosage. The residual concentration of the dye solution through adsorption was measured at a <b>wavelength</b> <b>nm</b> 665 by using a spectrophotometer (Cary 50 manufacturers of Perkin Elmer). In order to understand how to adsorption, obtained data were fitted with Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Harikens-jura and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and Pseudo –first –order, Pesedo – second – order, Intraparticle diffusion and Elovich Kinetics. Results: Results showed that in the between of five isotherm models, the adsorption process is most obeyed of Harikens-jura isotherm (R 2 = 0. 9914). Also the adsorption process has appropriate obeyed of both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms (R 2 = 0. 9633 and R 2 = 0. 9365) and it is means that the adsorption process occurs in a mono- layer and multi-layer. The low of mean free energy (E= 0. 323 KJ/mol) in Dubinin-Radushkevich showed that the physical absorption process is dominant adsorption. Also adsorption process is obeyed of pseudo – second – order model. Conclusion: According to the results, can say Methylene blue adsorption multi -layer is most occurs than mono- layer and the pumice is the effectiveness adsorbent for removal methylene blue dye (RL= 0. 2) ...|$|E
