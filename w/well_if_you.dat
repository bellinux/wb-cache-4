25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at a time like this. <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as <b>well.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E
500|$|Boyd met Harrison {{during the}} filming of The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night in 1964. [...] She was cast as a schoolgirl in that film. Her only line in the film was asking [...] "Prisoners?", but she later {{appeared}} in the [...] "I Should Have Known Better" [...] segment. Boyd was in a serious relationship with photographer Eric Swayne during this time, and so declined a date proposal from Harrison. Several days later, after ending her relationship with Swayne, {{she went back to}} work on the film, and Harrison asked her out on a date for a second time; she said [...] "yes". The couple went to a private gentlemen's club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. According to Boyd {{one of the first things}} Harrison said to her on the film set was: [...] "Will you marry me? <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't marry me, will you have dinner with me tonight?" ...|$|E

[...] "It is quite close to a small market-town called <b>Wells,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know where that is. I don't suppose you do, though," [...] he added. [...] "It is an out-of-the-way corner of the world." ...|$|R

500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised {{in a court of}} equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be <b>well</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... <b>well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|... "Father's Day" [...] was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored {{as well as the}} accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave [...] "one of the series' best performances" [...] as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the let-down of the episode, finding that [...] "the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were [...] "enormous logical gaps" [...] involving [...] "glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as [...] "a time-travel tale with immense heart" [...] and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done [...] "equally <b>well</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> scythed the Reapers from the script". Reviewing [...] "Father's Day" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of [...] "A", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would have done something else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "disconnected" [...] {{from the rest of the}} story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be [...] "the best story this season". He called the direction [...] "wonderful" [...] and the script [...] "sublime", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Mian {{praised the}} Saudi {{religious}} police practice of imprisoning {{people who do}} not pray: [...] "They send the police, and they say, <b>well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t come for prayer, close your shop, we will arrest you [...] But if you don’t, then we have to bring the punishment on you, you will be killed, and nobody will pray on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many people {{expressed}} {{doubts about}} his exact age, and on being presented by Denis Compton with the Cricketer of the Year Award for 1962, Compton said [...] "it is stated that you are only 43 years old. <b>Well</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are only 43, then I am still a baby in a nappy." [...] Compton had retired 5 years earlier, in 1957, the same year Alley had started his English first-class career.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 1890, the New Haven Morning News reported: [...] "The {{opening of}} Rosemary Hall {{took place at}} Wallingford {{yesterday}} ... at the beautiful Rosemary Farms, which have been the property of Mrs. Choate's family for five generations. ... Rev. Edward Everett Hale addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful.

2500|$|In President Me: The America That's in My Head, Carolla {{presents}} the comedian's fantasy of the United States {{with him at}} the helm. When asked in separate interviews, {{both before and after the}} book's release, about whether the [...] "if-I-were-king" [...] critique of America was a serious piece, he said it's both: [...] "Well, there's a lot of jokes in it, but you know, it's like... <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a fat friend you may make a lot of fat jokes about your fat friend, but he's still fat".|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 2012, Busch feuded with Justin Allgaier at the Nationwide {{event at}} Dover and {{after talking to}} his boss and brother Kyle. When asked by Bob Pockrass about being on probation, Busch said, [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's {{improper}} to say as <b>well.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can talk about racing things, we'll talk about many things, Bob. It is not racing, you're here just to start stuff, you know that's you're all out here for!" [...] NASCAR immediately suspended Busch from the Pocono race as a result for violating their policy forbidding swearing publicly.|$|E
2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's not that hard. If you have a good script that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then-Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich, Regimental Executive Officer at Forward Operating Base Salerno on Khost, Afghanistan, {{under which}} Tillman was serving {{at the time}} of his death, and who led the second {{investigation}} into Tillman's death, made statements about the Tillman family's search for the truth based on Tillman's atheism. In comments to ESPN, Kauzlarich said: [...] "These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs" [...] and [...] "When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt. So for their son to die for nothing and now he is no more... I do not know how an atheist thinks, I can only imagine that would be pretty tough." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was [...] "a film of sensitivity, {{observation}} and humor – a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less {{taken by the}} maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as <b>well...</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, {{you should know that}} this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I know I had a ball watching I Vitelloni again. It reminded me of the old gang." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{chartered}} trains transported Liverpool {{supporters to}} Sheffield for a match fixture in 1988, {{but only one}} such train ran in 1989. The 350 passengers arrived on the grounds about 2:20pm. Many supporters wished to enjoy the day and were {{in no hurry to}} enter the stadium too early. Some supporters were delayed by roadworks while crossing the Pennines on the M62 motorway which resulted in minor traffic congestion. Between 2:30pm and 2:40pm, there was a build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane, eager to enter the stadium before the game began. At 2:46pm, the BBC's football commentator John Motson had already noticed the imbalance of distribution of people in the Leppings Lane pens. While rehearsing for the match off-air, he suggested a nearby cameraman look as well. [...] "There's gaps, you know, in parts of the ground. <b>Well,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at the Liverpool end, {{to the right of the}} goal, there's hardly anybody on those steps...that's it. Look down there." ...|$|E
