5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted over Texas.|$|E
5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop <b>were</b> <b>last</b> restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Hunting along {{migration}} routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds <b>were</b> <b>last</b> seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|E

At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.|$|E
5|$|Its {{associated}} thunderstorm {{activity was}} sporadic and relatively disorganized, and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on July16. Claudette briefly re-intensified into {{a tropical storm}} before becoming extratropical later that day. Shortly thereafter, it merged with a cold front, while the remnants <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted near the Azores on July23. Tropical Storm Claudette had minimal effects on land. Severe rip currents from Claudette in North Carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured, although no fatalities occurred. Some residents of coastal North Carolina were even disappointed that Claudette was to remain offshore, as the region was suffering from dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Old Sleaford {{was in the}} {{possession}} of Ramsey Abbey at the time of Domesday and later Haverholme Priory, and was eventually served by a vicar; the church was dedicated either to St Giles or to All Saints. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536–41), the king took over collection of the tithes, eventually leasing them to Thomas Horseman and then selling them to Robert Carre. In the 17th century, the rectory of Quarrington and the vicarage were combined to form the parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford. The parish boundaries of New Sleaford and Quarrington with Old Sleaford <b>were</b> <b>last</b> altered in 1928.|$|E

5|$|On July26, the typhoon turned {{towards the}} {{northwest}} and weakened somewhat. Late the next day, Judy struck {{the southern coast}} of Kyushu before moving over the Korea Strait. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island caused the storm to degenerate. Less than a day after moving over Kyushu, the system weakened to a tropical storm and soon made landfall in South Korea, roughly 205km (125mi) west of Pusan. Once onshore, rapid weakening took place with Judy being downgraded to a tropical depression within 12hours. The remnants of Judy <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted on July29 over the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Season nine sees Reyes {{join the}} X-Files on a {{permanent}} basis, working with both John Doggett and Dana Scully. Following a year of investigating the paranormal, Doggett and Reyes <b>were</b> <b>last</b> seen in the New Mexico desert in 2002, where they were warning Agents Mulder and Scully of the arrival of Knowle Rohrer, a Super Soldier linked to the alien colonists. They were fleeing the scene as black helicopters destroyed the Anazasi adobes where The Smoking Man had been living. The X-Files office was closed shortly after the involvement of Walter Skinner and Alvin Kersh in Mulder's escape was revealed; Reyes still stayed with the FBI in some capacity for a time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003. The fourth named storm of the 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Delfina formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar on December30, 2002. It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December31. Delfina weakened while moving inland, {{and it was}} no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January1, 2003. However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina <b>were</b> <b>last</b> observed on January9.|$|E

5|$|The Sawtooth Mountains <b>were</b> <b>last</b> {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed {{during the}} Little Ice Age, which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation is {{abundant in the}} Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as the}} north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They <b>were</b> <b>last</b> {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
