25|$|Behavioral {{economics}} {{has also}} been applied to intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice is defined as making a decision and having the effects of such decision happening in a different time. Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by George Ainslie's hyperbolic discounting—one of the prominently studied observations—and further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue, and Matthew Rabin. Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes {{in the near future}} more than for outcomes in the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time t and t+1 will be low at time t-1 <b>when</b> <b>t</b> is the near future, but high at time t <b>when</b> <b>t</b> is the present and time t+1 is the near future.|$|E
25|$|Adaptive {{immunity}} {{can also}} be divided {{by the type of}} immune mediators involved; humoral immunity is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by secreted antibodies, whereas cell mediated immunity involves T-lymphocytes alone. Humoral immunity is called active when the organism generates its own antibodies, and passive when antibodies are transferred between individuals or species. Similarly, cell mediated immunity is active when the organisms’ own T-cells are stimulated, and passive <b>when</b> <b>T</b> cells come from another organism.|$|E

25|$|Any {{subspace}} {{spanned by}} eigenvectors of T is an invariant subspace of T, and the restriction of T {{to such a}} subspace is diagonalizable. Moreover, if the entire vector space V can be spanned by the eigenvectors of T, or equivalently if the direct sum of the eigenspaces associated with all the eigenvalues of T is the entire vector space V, then a basis of V called an eigenbasis can be formed from linearly independent eigenvectors of T. <b>When</b> <b>T</b> admits an eigenbasis, T is diagonalizable.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there is}} a variety Av and a family of degree 0 line bundles P, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by Av such that a family L on T is {{associated}} a unique morphism f: T → Av so that L is isomorphic to the pullback of P along the morphism 1A×f: A×T → A×Av. Applying this to the case <b>when</b> <b>T</b> is a point, {{we see that the}} points of Av correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on A, so {{there is a}} natural group operation on Av given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.|$|E
25|$|When {{searching for}} food, primary {{orientation}} is when ants are exploring a new terrain without {{the guidance of}} odor trails.

The major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally elevated, bilaterally depressed, unilaterally elevated, and unilaterally depressed.

25|$|This axiomatization is complete, {{meaning that}} every Boolean law s= t is provable in this system. One first shows by {{induction}} on {{the height of}} s that every Boolean law for which t is atomic is provable, using R1 for the base case (since distinct atoms are never equal) and A1 and R3 for the induction step (s an application). This proof strategy amounts to a recursive procedure for evaluating s to yield an atom. Then to prove s= t in the general case <b>when</b> <b>t</b> may be an application, use {{the fact that if}} s= t is an identity then s and t must evaluate to the same atom, call it u. So first prove s= u and t= u as above, that is, evaluate s and t using A1, R1, and R3, and then invoke R2 to infer s= t.|$|E
25|$|The Roman magistrates who {{conquered the}} Greek world were fitted into this tradition; games {{were set up}} in honor of M.

The Greeks also devised a goddess Roma, not worshipped at Rome, who was worshipped with Flamininus (their joint cult is attested in 195 BC); she would become a symbol of idealised romanitas in the later Roman provinces, and a continuing link, whereas a Marcellus or Flamininus might only hold power for a couple years.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Mathematical statistics. Johannesburg, February 2014. In this study we examine the question of which statistical mod- els work well in predicting customer defection in the retail mobile telecommunication industry. For {{each of the two}} data sets that were used (mobile call pattern and billing, and time taken to churn data), four statistical models were tted and compared namely; arti cial neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression and support vector machines. The arti cial neural network model proved to be supe- rior than the other three models <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> on both data sets. This model gave the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0. 93 for call pattern data and 0. 88 for billing and time taken to churn data), highest lift at 10 per cent of the population (7. 01 for call pattern data and 2. 12 for billing and time taken to churn data) and lowest misclassi cation rate (0. 04 for call pattern data and 0. 19 for billing and time taken to churn data). The logistic regression model under performed the other models <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> to call pattern data and came out as third <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> to billing and time taken to churn data whereby they outperformed the decision tree model. Support vector machine came out as the second best model for billing and time taken to churn data and third <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> to call pattern data. Decision tree model performed well <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> to call pattern data and worst <b>when</b> <b>tted</b> to billing and time taken to churn data The study showed that in the retail mobile telecommunication industry, companies can increase revenue streams and competitive advantage by using data mining techniques to predict customers that are likely to churn.

25|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of transferring silica {{absorbed by the}} diatom to the cell wall is unknown, though research is still being undertaken. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from {{the search for the}} {{mechanism of}} silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the frustule. The most success in this area has come from two species, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and Cylindrotheca fusiformis, in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered. Silaffins, sets of polycationic peptides, were found in C. fusiformis cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns1. <b>When</b> <b>T.</b> pseudonana underwent genome analysis it was found that it encoded a urea cycle, including a higher number of polyamines than most genomes, as well as three distinct silica transport genes. In a phylogenetic study on silica transport genes from 8 diverse groups of diatoms, silica transport was found to generally group with species. This study also found structural differences between the silica transporters of pennate (bilateral symmetry) and centric (radial symmetry) diatoms. The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.|$|E

500|$|Its undoing as an {{independent}} company began in 1982 <b>when</b> <b>T.</b> Boone Pickens, an Amarillo, Texas oilman and corporate raider (or greenmailer), and owner of Mesa Petroleum, made an offer for the comparatively larger (but still considered [...] "non-major" [...] oil company) Cities Service Company (more generally known by the name Citgo) from Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was then trading in the low 20s. Pickens first privately offered $45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a $50 a share public offer when Cities' CEO rejected the friendly offer. Gulf forestalled Mesa's takeover attempt by offering $63 a share in a friendly offer which Cities (by then trading at $37) accepted. Cities then bought out Pickens for $55 a share. Once Pickens was gone, Gulf reneged on its buyout offer, supposedly over a dispute regarding accuracy of Cities Service's reserves, and the stock price of Cities plunged, triggering stockholder lawsuits as well as distrust for Gulf's management on Wall Street and among financing investment banks who bet big in assisting Gulf to defeat Mesa only to be left broke when Gulf backed out. Cities Service was ultimately sold to Occidental Petroleum, and the retail operations were resold to Southland Corporation, the operators of 7-Eleven stores. Gulf's termination of the Cities Service acquisition resulted in more than 15 years of shareholder litigation against Gulf (and later Chevron).|$|E
