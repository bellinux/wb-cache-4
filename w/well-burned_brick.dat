50|$|The mosque {{was built}} of adobe; {{the church had}} added to it an apse of <b>well-burned</b> <b>brick.</b> The eastern windows were covered, while the narrow ones of {{the north and south}} ends were {{replaced}} by large simple ones, rounded at the top and still in place. Traces of the upper mosque windows, now blocked by bricks, can be seen beneath the masonry. In 1862, the church was expanded by 7 m to the west, giving it its current shape and dimensions. This wing includes a window similar to the other ones and side entrances to the north and south. Inside, there is an upper level in the addition. In 1922, the exterior walls were redone, the adobe replaced by pressed brick. In 1935, the persistent mouldiness of the outside walls was addressed by replacing the brick and leaving a ventilation shaft between the layers. The communist authorities wanted to demolish the church in the 1950s, and it was saved through the persistence of a priest who risked imprisonment to make numerous requests to that effect.|$|E
