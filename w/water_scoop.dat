50|$|LMS engines {{operated}} {{over the}} Southern Region, {{where there were}} no water troughs, were paired with four-axled ex-WD tenders with larger water tanks.

5000|$|The Maluku myotis (Myotis moluccarum), also {{commonly}} known as the Arafura large-footed bat, is a species of mouse-eared bat. Native to Indonesia, and possibly New Guinea and northern Australia, it one of several species known as [...] "fishing bats" [...] because they catch their prey on the surface of <b>water,</b> <b>scooping</b> it up with their large feet.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{inferior}} efficiency {{compared to a}} <b>water</b> mill, <b>water</b> <b>scoops</b> are less common, and {{have been used in}} the past mostly for applications where linear motion is required rather than rotation, for example hammers in smitheries, saws in sawmills, and stamp mills in mining. They are also used for fulling and, nowadays, to operate animated sculptures in fountains.|$|R

The leaves are usually very leathery and not eaten by cattle. The leaves are used by street food sellers to serve food placed on the leaves.|$|R

50|$|No. 758 {{was fitted}} with an {{extended}} smokebox in 1900. Oil burning apparatus was fitted to No. 712 and 759-767. No. 760 was named Petrolea. Tenders with <b>water</b> <b>scoops</b> were fitted to Nos. 762-767 and 1030-1039 {{to enable the}} Cromer expresses to run non-stop from Liverpool Street to North Walsham from 1 July 1897. Water troughs were installed at Halifax Junction, Ipswich and at Tivetshall St. Mary.|$|R
50|$|The {{earth for}} the pottery {{is found in}} Onta in the mountains. It {{normally}} {{comes in the form}} of rocks and needs to be ground to a pulver. This is done by the usage of traditional <b>water</b> <b>scoops</b> or mills called kara-usu, which rely purely on the flow of the river. The wooden mills grind the earth into a powder, which is then washed and filtered multiple times to purify the material. It is then dried, sometimes over a large oven.|$|R
50|$|The first {{examples}} {{were built}} {{shortly after the}} acquisition of the Chester and Holyhead Railway by the LNWR, and primarily saw use on the Irish Mail route from London to Holyhead. They were the first locomotives to be fitted with <b>water</b> <b>scoops,</b> which could refill the tender from water troughs between the tracks without stopping. One such locomotive, No. 229 Watt, {{was the first to}} use them in non-stop run from Holyhead to Stafford in 1862, while conveying despatches relating to the Trent Affair.|$|R

50|$|A track pan (American terminology) {{or water}} trough (British terminology) is {{a device to}} enable a steam railway {{locomotive}} to replenish its water supply while in motion. It consists of a long trough filled with water, lying between the rails. When a steam locomotive passes over the trough, a <b>water</b> <b>scoop</b> can be lowered, and the speed of forward motion forces water into the scoop, up the scoop pipe and into the tanks or locomotive tender.|$|E
50|$|It {{is still}} highly {{regarded}} for its well-filmed sequences by cinematographer Billy Williams showing {{the operation of}} the East Coast main line and the Gresley A4 as it was in mainline use, for example the <b>water</b> <b>scoop</b> and corridor tender, although the whimsical verse commentary dates the work considerably. The film also offers a social record of the different hierarchies existing within the railway, as well as the fashion and people in the 1950s, albeit in a romanticised portrayal.|$|E
50|$|Bridge scour is {{the removal}} of {{sediment}} such as sand and gravel from around bridge abutments or piers. Scour, caused by swiftly moving <b>water,</b> can <b>scoop</b> out scour holes, compromising the integrity of a structure.|$|R
50|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} {{were introduced}} in the United Kingdom by British Railways in the 1950s, working alongside steam traction until 1968. Passenger vehicles were heated by steam from the locomotive boiler at that time, and the early diesel locomotives were provided with auxiliary boilers to provide the steam. Locomotives intended for long non-stop runs (such as the Class 40 and Class 55) were fitted with <b>water</b> <b>scoops</b> {{to allow them to}} replenish the steam generator's water supply from troughs/pans. The withdrawal of steam traction and the introduction of rolling stock with electric rather than steam heating removed the need for such equipment on later types and scoop-equipped locomotives had their scoops removed.|$|R
5000|$|In Indonesia the palm-leaf {{manuscript}} {{is called}} lontar. The Indonesian word is the modern form of Old Javanese rontal. It {{is composed of}} two Old Javanese words, namely ron [...] "leaf" [...] and tal [...] "Borassus flabellifer, palmyra palm". Due {{to the shape of}} the palmyra palm's leaves, which are spread like a fan, these trees are also known as [...] "fan trees". The leaves of the rontal tree have always been used for many purposes, such as for the making of plaited mats, palm sugar wrappers, <b>water</b> <b>scoops,</b> ornaments, ritual tools, and writing material. Today, the art of writing in rontal still survives in Bali, performed by Balinese Brahmin as a sacred duty to rewrite Hindu texts.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>water</b> <b>scoop</b> is {{a simple}} {{hydropower}} machine - that is, a machine used to extract power from the flow of water. Unlike a water wheel it operates intermittently, like a seesaw: A container (a bucket or cup) {{at the end of}} a lever is filled with water in the upper position. The container side becomes heavier, and so the lever with the filled container moves downward, which may be used to operate a machine drive. In the lower position the container is emptied, and the lever moves back into the upward position.|$|E
5000|$|E6s Atlantic #460 was selected, being {{recently}} overhauled {{but having}} {{had time to}} [...] "run in" [...] after the work; B60B baggage car #7874 was equipped as a darkroom and P70 coach #3301 would carry PRR and newsreel company officials. The crew were cleared to run {{as fast as they}} considered safe; the tender would not need refueling during the run and the <b>water</b> <b>scoop</b> would pick up water from track pans without stopping. Unfortunately, the scoop was damaged during the first pickup attempt due to the speed at which the train had been traveling. An unscheduled three-minute stop near Wilmington was needed to repair it and fill up from a standpipe.|$|E
50|$|Like Ramsbottom's earlier DX Goods design, the Lady of the Lake class {{made use}} of the Stephenson valve gear and his own screw design of {{reversing}} gear. These locomotives saw the first use of Henri Giffard's steam injector in Britain, {{as well as the}} use of a <b>water</b> <b>scoop.</b> They were all painted in the green livery used by the Northern Division. The first locomotive built, No. 184 Problem, was reputed to have gained the name because of the problem of getting the new injector to work, but the first ten engines (of which Problem was one) were fitted with a traditional crosshead pump. Her name may have a more mathematical origin, as the DX Goods locomotive No. 183 was given the name Theorem.|$|E

50|$|Konkonte powder can {{be mixed}} with room {{temperature}} water or hot water. Some people prefer adding hot {{water to the}} powder first before cooking. It is stirred on the fire until it thickens and then it is kneaded and cooked some more. If it is too thick one adds a little more hot water to it then covered with a lid for few minutes then kneaded against the pot until the water mixes it well, (you may have to repeat the hot water addition and kneading if necessary until you get the right consistency)until it is cooked. Serving 1: Once cooked, wet a deep bowl all around with a little <b>water,</b> <b>scoop</b> portion suitable for your meal and place in middle of bowl,draw all edges of konkonte to middle of portion, it will create a smooth base of konkonte underneath.

40|$|Irrigation Water Scooped-Wheel is an {{appropriate}} and environmental friendly technology to deliver water from lower river to higher land. The main source of driving power of <b>water</b> <b>scooped</b> wheel is the forces caused by water flow impact on vanes. The force has not been measured. Knowing the forces will enable to estimate the wheel potential to deliver water. The objectives {{of this study are}} to determine the force on vanes and to evaluate influencing factors. The forces are determined by moment equilibrium between the moment of vanes and the moment provided to prevent the wheel to rotate. At 0. 282 m/s water velocity,  magnitude of force on vane (0. 3 x 0. 7 m 2) were 34 – 130 Newton. The force on vanes are affected by the area of vanes impacted by flowing water, the position on vanes toward flowing water and the water flow velocity. </p...|$|R
