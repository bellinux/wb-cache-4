5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} for another war, the historic peace churches, represented by Friends <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> inner dealings of Washington D.C. politics, attempted to influence new draft bills {{to ensure their}} men could fulfill their duty in an alternative, non-military type of service. On June 20, 1940, the Burke-Wadsworth Bill came before Congress. The arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the World War I provisions.|$|E
5|$|Let Go is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, {{released}} on 4 June 2002. For {{a year after}} signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there, her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team The Matrix, <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> her vision for the album.|$|E
5|$|To address his problems, Cho's {{parents also}} {{took him to}} church. According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was a smart student <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> the Bible, but he was {{concerned}} about Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he never heard him say a complete sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was autistic and he asked her to take him to a hospital, but she declined.|$|E

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E
5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> the series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E
5|$|In August 1701, George was {{invested}} with the Order of the Garter and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or her son. However, it was George <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> the complexities of English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of Lüneburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E
5|$|Leech {{was named}} in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union {{exempted}} her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> her special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.|$|E

Now that Merrick had found someone <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a {{friendly}} relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} people who watch, rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E

5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and <b>who</b> <b>understood</b> his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue {{as if it were an}} actual battle.|$|E
