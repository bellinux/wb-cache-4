5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or gravel pack {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the <b>well</b> <b>installation</b> process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures.|$|E

Five new groundwater monitoring wells were installed at the Y- 12 Plant under the FY 1998 drilling program. Two of the wells are located in west Bear Creek Valley, one is in the eastern Y- 12 Plant area near Lake Reality, and two are located near the Oil Landfarm Waste Management Area, which were installed by Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (Bechtel Jacobs) {{as part of a}} site characterization activity for the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) Disposal Cell. Also, two existing wells were upgraded and nine temporary piezometers were installed to characterize hydrogeologic conditions at the Disposal Cell site. In addition, 40 temporary piezometers were installed in the Boneyard/Bumyard area of Bear Creek Valley by Bechtel Jacobs as part of the accelerated remedial actions conducted by the Environmental Restoration Program. Ten monitoring wells at the Y- 12 Plant were decommissioned in FY 1998. Two existing monitoring wells were redeveloped during FY 1998 (of these, GW- 732 was redeveloped tsvice).

The (S/ 0) model uses parallel recombinative {{simulated annealing}} {{to search for}} an optimal design and applies the BIOPLUME II model to simulate aquifer hydraulics and bioremediation. Parallel recombinative simulated annealing is a general-purpose optimization approach that has the good convergence of simulated annealing and the efficient parallelization of a genetic algorithm. We propose a two-stage management approach. The first stage design goal is to minimize total system cost (pumping/treatment, <b>well</b> <b>installation</b> and facility capital costs). The second stage design goal is to minimize cost of a time-varying pumping strategy using the optimal system chosen by the first stage optimization. Optimization results show that parallel recombinative simulated annealing performs better than simulated annealing and genetic algorithms for optimizing system design when including installation costs.
