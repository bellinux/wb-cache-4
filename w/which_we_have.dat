5|$|October 5, 1841—No {{work was}} done today, as all the people have it to gather their own crop—It is a rule <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> to give all the negroes {{one day in the}} spring to plant, and one day in the fall to reap, and as there is a rule on Sea Island {{plantations}} fixing the tasks required each day to be done, it occurs, during the long days of summer, that the hand is generally done his task by 2 p.m., often sooner, so they have abundance of time to work their own crop, fish, etc., etc.|$|E
5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the most {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); {{he is also the}} personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> reached that {{end of the}} vast tomb where the hunchbacked king used to sit, and saw at once that our quest was vain. The tunnel <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> dug beyond was utterly choked with masses of fallen rock that we could never hope to move, even {{with the aid of}} explosives, of <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> none left.|$|R

5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing {{in the nature of the}} cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is {{currently}} {{one of only}} six identified Solar System bodies of <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> physical samples, coming {{from a number of}} meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites from the Moon, and samples returned from the Moon, the comet Wild 2, and the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill House was {{the largest}} estate in the village; a {{freehold}} mansion house on Carr Hill Lane. The date of building is unknown, {{but it does not}} appear on an enclosure map of 1766, suggesting it was built after that date. There is strong evidence that it was once a lunatic asylum; in 1770 an advertisement in a local newspaper declared:LUNATICKSCarr's Hill House on Gateshead Fell To The Public We beg Leave to inform the Public that we have opened the above HOUSE pleasantly situated about a mile distant from Newcastle, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> fitted up in an elegant manner, with every Accommodation for the reception of LUNATICKS in genteel or opulent circumstances: in this House Persons entrusted to our Care shall be treated with the utmost Attention and Humanity. The terms are reasonable. R. Lambert, W. Keenlyside, H Gibson, R. Stoddard (surgeons to the Infirmary), Newcastle 1767.|$|E

60|$|It {{is evident}} that Berkeley here confounded sameness numero with sameness specie, that is, with exact resemblance, and assumed the former where {{there was only the}} latter; not perceiving that when <b>we</b> say <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the same thought to-day <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> yesterday, <b>we</b> do not mean the same {{individual}} thought, but a thought exactly similar: as we say that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the same illness <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> last year, meaning only the same sort of illness.|$|R
60|$|Last of all, we {{returned}} to the bower and collected the few articles we possessed--such as the axe, the pencil-case, the broken telescope, the penknife, the hook made from the brass ring, and the sail-needle, with <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> landed on the island; also the long boots and the pistol, besides several curious articles of costume <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> manufactured from time to time.|$|R
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|These three works <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{composed}} we desire {{should be}} put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
