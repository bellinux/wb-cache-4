We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... When we put that record out, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> we were doing was illegal, but {{we thought it was}} gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{also stated}} that the choice to work with Dave Eringa again was {{important}} for this album: [...] "We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they wanted to sound like, so we didn't {{want to use a}} mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him." ...|$|E

It was in a way difficult, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> we are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely. I was earlier scared {{to go ahead with the}} project. I can only say I have made this show with complete honesty and without compromising on anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antipop was {{released}} in 1999, and featured production and guest appearances from James Hetfield from Metallica, Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, Matt Stone from South Park, Stewart Copeland from the Police, Jim Martin from Faith No More and Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit. While producing the song [...] "Lacquer Head", Durst encouraged Primus {{to return to the}} more aggressive sound of their earlier albums for Antipop. Some critics compared the album's murky downtuned guitars to nu metal, which was popular during the time. The band toured in support of Antipop with Ozzfest and Family Values Tour. The band released a music video for the album's only single, [...] "Lacquer Head", which was banned from MTV because of references to and depictions of drug use, despite the song's anti-drug message. Tensions among the band rose considerably during this period, Claypool stated [...] "there was some doubt at the label as to whether <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the hell we were doing anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Still {{considered}} one of the most athletic guys in the Irish game despite his age, Turner's intensity and determination in 2016–17 was spurred on by Killester's National Cup semi-final defeat to eventual winners Templeogue in January 2016. It served as a powerful motivator and he was determined to upset the odds once again. And so it was, on January 7, 2017, Turner amassed a staggering 28 rebounds and 15 points that helped his team to a memorable and unexpected 81–69 win over UCD Marian in the Men's National Cup semi-final. He was carried off following a knee injury with 3:33 remaining in the third quarter but after intense treatment returned to the action two minutes into the fourth quarter. Not many pundits gave Killester a chance of toppling UCD Marian, as Marian had defeated Killester in league competition earlier in the season. After the game, Turner was proud in the manner his teammates approached the game, saying [...] "I am not surprised no one gave us a glimmer but as a team <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was needed to defeat this very talented side." [...] Killester went on to lose in the National Cup final to Swords Thunder on January 28, as they were heavily defeated 72–51 despite Turner's 12 points and game-high 16 rebounds.|$|E
2500|$|Ross and Urie {{soon began}} to commit to their laptops the demos they had been {{developing}} and posted three early demos ("Time to Dance," [...] "Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks" [...] and [...] "Camisado") on PureVolume. On a whim, they sent a link to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time {{with the rest of}} Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing [...] "two to three" [...] songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. [...] "Almost right away <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen," [...] Ross explained in a 2006 interview. [...] "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we were and {{what we were going to}} sound like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> we wanted to do from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
