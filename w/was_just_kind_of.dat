It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

500|$|... "Now You Know" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. The episode featured the debut of Dana Delany as Katherine Mayfair, a former Wisteria Lane resident who moves back to the neighborhood. Cherry describes the character as [...] "a woman who was clearly different in the past... an alpha female who goes up against all-out women, especially Bree." [...] Cherry developed Katherine {{with the intention of}} making her [...] "a character everyone loves to hate," [...] citing J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) from Dallas and Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear) from Melrose Place as inspirations. Cherry ensured that character would have [...] "a comedic point of view," [...] unlike the Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) character from the series' second season, stating: [...] "In the second season we went to the mystery that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dark and stopped the action.

Picardo's fellow Voyager actor Ethan Phillips, who played Neelix, cameos as a nightclub Maitre d' in the holodeck scene. Phillips recalled that the producers wanted the fans to be left guessing whether he was the person who played Neelix or not, as he did {{not appear in the}} credits; [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a goofy thing to do." [...] During production there were incorrect rumors that Avery Brooks would reprise his role as [...] captain Benjamin Sisko.

While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what was}} in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show.

500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E

[...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, [...] "In the Dark" [...] was released in a digital extended play (EP) alongside three remixes of the track {{as well as its}} music video. Rapper Flo Rida is featured on an official remix of the song, and Dev stated that she wanted to make a remix as it would be refreshing and [...] "great for radio". She explained that a rapper would suit the song well and that she would enjoy the remix when hearing it on the radio. She elaborated on choosing Flo Rida, saying: [...] "We went in thinking about who would be cool on the radio and who would fit the fact that it's kind of a flavorful song and not really a hood rap song. Flo Rida fit, and he completely killed it." [...] 50 Cent is featured on another remix of the track, which he recorded at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza (Spain) in August 2011, while Kanye West appears on an unofficial remix, of which Dev said: [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> something that floated onto the Internet and the airwaves, which I don't mind at all because it sounds absolutely amazing and it's one of my favorite remixes too." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{the initial}} wave of American {{hardcore}} punk had waned and split into other subgenres. The Seattle-based grunge movement was among the many styles of music that directly evolved from hardcore. Through the mainstream success of several grunge bands, the word mosh entered the popular North American vocabulary and the dance spread to many other music genres. According to John Linnell of They Might Be Giants, [...] "it didn’t matter what kind of music you were playing or what kind of band you were; everybody moshed to everything.

2500|$|Cornell {{struggled}} with depression and had multiple addictions (mostly alcohol and prescription drugs), {{which he was}} able to manage from roughly 1980 until 1997, when Soundgarden broke up and his first marriage was failing. At that point he turned to OxyContin and other substances. Cornell said about that period; [...] "I went through a serious crisis with depression where I didn't eat a whole meal every day. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> shutting down. I eventually found that the only way out of that was to change virtually everything in my life. That was a very frightening thing to do, but it was worthwhile." [...] He checked into rehab in 2002 and quit drinking and smoking around 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The Sun {{described}} the album as [...] "a mixture of ballads and the relentlessly upbeat, catchy hits {{we have come}} to expect." [...] Kimberley Walsh has said that the album is [...] "a lot older sounding, which wasn't intentional, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> how it went." [...] The girl group were very involved in the album's direction. [...] "The '60s thing is quite prominent," [...] Walsh told the BBC. [...] "But it's out of the ordinary. Not really what you'd expect." [...] Nicola Roberts said that the album also features a lot of 1980s-inspired electropop. Sarah Harding said that Girls Aloud [...] "wanted to stay upbeat but try something a bit different and advanced. I don't think anything we've ever done has ever sounded the same. But we have that same vibe whatever we do because of our vocals." [...] Nadine Coyle said the [...] "aim from the beginning was to come up with songs that didn't sound like anything else out there." [...] Walsh continued, [...] "We want to impress the fans with what we do, so we've tried to up our game with this album and step outside the comfort zone." ...|$|E

I want to give Greg (Ives, crew chief) a lot of credit and the guys. They gave us a good enough car to come here and qualify well.

The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that <b>was,</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E

[...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe. [...] "I'm hoping to show I can do a wide range of things," [...] concluding, [...] "The whole album really just goes back to love songs." ...|$|E
