Akhtar changed a number of aspects of the climax as he felt the {{original}} ending was outdated for today's audiences. On the other hand, a number of elements from the original were retained in the new film, notably the background score, two songs, some dialogue, and some situations, all of which Akhtar believed <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> in the original, saying that not including them would be a crime.|$|E

25|$|However, {{pressure}} from the Admiralty kept microwaves in everyone's mind. While the 1.5m sets <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> for detecting larger ships, they could not effectively see smaller objects, like U-Boat conning towers. This was {{for the same reason}} that antennas need to be roughly the size of the wavelength; to provide a reasonable reflection, the objects need to be at several times larger than the wavelength. The Admiralty had the advantage of administering the UK's vacuum tube development efforts, under the Communication Valve Development Committee (CVD), and were able to continue development of suitable tubes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1st century AD {{writings}} of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides {{a recipe for}} lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, a possible ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape. The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of his career in 1932 his play was {{observed}} by Great Britain's then active Davis Cup player Nigel Sharpe, who described Rogers as the tallest man on the field at the time who took advantage of his height. In baseline game his reach advantage came into picture and was very effective against passing shots. When it came to volleying he lacked the sufficient quickness to cover the net at its full length and moved uncomfortably in the forecourt. So {{he was one of the}} few baseliners of his time. His hit the ball flat and with a short swing. His first serve had great speed, while the second was rather a kick-serve, which showed to be his weakness. His forehand drive was strong and his overhead smashes <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> enough. In doubles he positioned himself between the T-line and the baseline, which was an unordinary gameplan.|$|E

25|$|A cataclysmic {{event for}} Chikun {{happened}} {{at the beginning of}} 1986. At around lunch time on January 6, 1986, Cho was leaving in his car when a motorcyclist came around from his blind spot. He had avoided Cho's car, only to have slid and overturned on his motorcycle. Cho was helping the motorcyclist to stand up, and then he went to pick the bike up when a car hit him. His right thigh was broken and he suffered other injuries. He was sent into the emergency room and had an operation the day after. The injuries would take three months to heal. Cho was determined not to let it affect him. Since his head and hand <b>were</b> <b>fine,</b> he went ahead and played {{the first game of the}} Kisei tournament. He played a good game, only to lose by 2.5 points. Cho recovered from the loss and took the next two games. Kobayashi then took 3 in a row and Cho was without a title for the first time in 8 years—something tremendous, considering he was only 29 years old. He went on to lose in a playoff for the Meijin, only to end the year with winning the Gosei title. This year ended better than last with a record of 35 wins and 17 losses.|$|E
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Britney Spears guest {{starred in the}} episode as herself. According to Scully, she was {{seventeen}} to eighteen {{years old when she}} recorded her lines, and [...] "She {{was a lot of fun}} to work with. She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that. We originally had her introduce herself [...] as 'I'm teenage songbird Britney Spears.' And she recorded a few takes and they <b>were</b> <b>fine.</b> And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [...] 'She can't say songbird.' [...] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult." [...] The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to [...] "I'm teen sensation Britney Spears." ...|$|E
500|$|Roth's fake trailer {{contained}} {{elements that}} almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting {{stabbed in the}} vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, [...] "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But {{we had a great}} discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> with it." [...] Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film.|$|E

The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo {{was much}} {{in favor of}} {{philosophical}} Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings. Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist I Ching in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through [...] "crude traces", which he likens to mathematical astronomy. Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to [...] "make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them," [...] which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well. Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them. Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained. When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside <b>were</b> <b>fine,</b> yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The twentieth stage {{came down}} to a sprint finish, won by Paolo Rosola, who was later disqualified as his teammate, Roberto Pagnin, {{was found to have}} pushed him during the sprint. As a result, the second-place finisher, Alessio Di Basco, was awarded the stage victory. The {{penultimate}} stage was completely flat and culminated in a bunch sprint, won by Urs Freuler. Hours later, the final stage – a hilly [...] individual time trial – took place. The weather conditions <b>were</b> <b>fine</b> {{for the majority of the}} riders, but as the general classification contenders were on the course, it began to lightning and rain heavily. There was a tricky descent about [...] into the stage, which became more dangerous with the rain and ultimately resulted in the crashes of Giupponi and Zimmerman. The time lost by Zimmermann cost him his second place overall. Lech Piasecki, who rode the course when dry, won the stage by a wide margin. Hampsten lost twenty seconds to Breukink, but it did not prevent him from becoming the first American to win the Giro d'Italia. The other podium positions were filled by non-Italian riders for the second year in a row and the third time in the history of the race. Breukink had been part of the non-Italian podium in 1987, behind Ireland's Stephen Roche and Great Britain's Robert Millar.|$|E
