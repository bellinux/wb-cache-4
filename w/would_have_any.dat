5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, {{his view of the}} Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E

25|$|However, {{commitment}} to laissez faire was not uniform and some economists advocated state support {{of public works}} and education.

25|$|In 1906, {{he became}} a {{volunteer}} at Haileybury House, a charitable club for working-class boys in Stepney in the East End of London run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. Until then, his political views had been more conservative. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the slum children, {{he came to the}} view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and income redistribution by the state <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to socialism. He subsequently joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} an asset-based approach, the valuation professional {{must consider}} whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> authority {{to access the}} value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell {{all or part of the}} assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access {{the value of the}} assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon joining, Riddell {{knew that}} he could assist in {{improving}} the ritual. He was appointed to a ritual committee consisting of himself, LeRoy Fairchild, George Beal, Adon Smith, and William West. The first revision was undertaken with earnest. Riddell would bring his sense of showmanship to the ritual, adding in many flashy and fanciful Persian portions. Beal, on the other hand, had more interest in classical mythology and wanted those elements incorporated into the work. A compromise was found that incorporated Beal’s desires, but also included the theatrical elements proposed by Riddell, not to mention the devilish motif that was still intact from the early days. From then on, only Beal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> real say in changes to the ritual, which remains his legacy to this day. In 1917, Beal would be officially lauded by the Supreme Council for his work, cementing his place in Grotto history.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1811, King George III was mad and, {{although}} still King in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son George was Prince Regent. On 6 November 1817 the Prince Regent's only daughter, Princess Charlotte, wife of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King Leopold I of the Belgians), died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become Queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was forty-nine years-old, thus there was little likelihood that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages {{with the intent of}} producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress Dorothea Jordan, but, being illegitimate, they were debarred from the succession.|$|E
25|$|Commitment to laissez-faire, however, was not uniform. Some economists {{advocated}} {{state support}} {{of public works}} and education. Classical liberals were also divided on free trade. David Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate {{the number of hours}} that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation. Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as Jane Marcet and Harriet Martineau. The strongest defender of laissez-faire was The Economist founded by James Wilson in 1843. The Economist criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. The Economist took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water, and granting of patents and copyrights.|$|E

25|$|By this point, some {{prominent}} members of Mussolini's government had turned against him. Among them were Grandi and Ciano. Several {{of his colleagues}} were close to revolt, and Mussolini was forced to summon the Grand Council of Fascism on 24 July 1943. This {{was the first time}} that body had met since the start of the war. When he announced that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on him. Grandi moved a resolution asking the king to resume his full constitutional powers which was, in effect, a vote of no confidence in Mussolini. This motion carried by a 19–8 margin. Despite this sharp rebuke, Mussolini showed up for work the next day as usual. He allegedly viewed the Grand Council as merely an advisory body and did not think the vote <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> substantive effect. That afternoon, he was summoned to the royal palace by King Victor Emmanuel III, who had been planning to oust Mussolini earlier. When Mussolini tried to tell the king about the meeting, Victor Emmanuel cut him off and told him that he was being replaced by Marshal Pietro Badoglio. After Mussolini left the palace, he was arrested by Carabinieri on the king's orders.|$|E
25|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, {{measurements}} of aether wind effects of first order, i.e. effects proportional to v/c (v being Earth's velocity, c {{the speed of}} light) {{were thought to be}} possible, but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01% change in the speed of light. A number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself, but of variations in the speed of light (see First order aether-drift experiments). The Hoek experiment, for example, was intended to detect interferometric fringe shifts due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest. The results of such experiments were all negative. This could be explained by using Fresnel's dragging coefficient, according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> hope of detecting aether drift, i.e. effects proportional to v2/c2. Existing experimental setups, however, were not sensitive enough to measure effects of that size.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that the bystander effect may be present in computer-mediated communication situations. Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress. In the experiment, 400 online chat groups were observed. One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room: either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen. The purpose of the experiment {{was to determine whether}} or not the gender of the victim mattered, if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> effect. Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim. Consistent with findings of Latané and Darley, the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect. The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups. However, this effect was nonexistent when the victim (Suzy or Jake) asked for help from a specific person in the chat group. The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was 36.38 seconds. The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was 51.53 seconds.|$|E
