5|$|Although the Colts' rushing defense looked {{extremely}} weak {{during the}} season, {{it ended up}} being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 23–8, holding Chiefs running back Larry Johnson (<b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 15–6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back Jamal Lewis (<b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl Most Valuable Player honors {{were awarded}} to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 174yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who threw for 370yards. Each was the {{statistical}} leader at his respective position, and Scott scored Maryland's two final touchdowns {{to break the}} 28–28 stalemate. Scott also was able to help Maryland clinch the victory in the final minutes by rushing for a first down that allowed the team to run out the clock.|$|E

5|$|The {{attendance}} of 113,090 {{was the highest}} in college football history. Robinson had 29 carries and completed 19-of-22 passes for 186 yards, contributing 383 of Michigan's 473 total yards. Robinson ran for 197 yards, setting a school record for a quarterback, surpassing Steve Smith, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 147 yards on four carries at Minnesota on November 12, 1983. Michigan committed no turnovers, {{the first time since}} the game against Miami (Ohio) on September 6, 2008. With the win, the Wolverines improved to 108–18–2 all-time in home openers.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} with a knee injury, and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 1,182 yards (breaking his own team record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top offense in the NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at Dallas to secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State got {{the ball}} to start the game. Their first drive was {{highlighted}} by a 26–yard pass from Sam Richardson to Josh Lenz. The drive totaled 9 plays and 56 yards and culminated with a 33–yard field goal by Edwin Arceo. Tulsa and Iowa State exchanged punts on their next two drives. When Tulsa {{got the ball}} back again, Trey Watts rushed the ball for four yards on the first play of the drive, and then Cody Green threw a short pass that was intercepted by defensive back Jeremy Reeves and returned 31 {{yards for a touchdown}} that put Tulsa up 10–0. Tulsa then put together a 9–play, 75–yard drive during which all three running backs: Alex Singleton, Ja'Terian Douglas, and Trey Watts rushed the ball. It was Singleton <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for a two-yard touchdown that made the score 10-7. Iowa State's next drive lasted only two plays, but the second was a 69–yard pass from Richardson to tight end Ernst Brun Jr. for a touchdown. The final two drives of the quarter both went three-and-out.|$|E

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Volunteers' rushing offense {{had been}} led by Aaron Hayden {{during the regular}} season, but Hayden broke his leg during Tennessee's final regular season game. Due to the injury, James Stewart was {{forecast}} to start the game at running back for the Volunteers. During the regular season, Tennessee was ranked No. 13 in rushing, accumulating an average of 231.2 rushing yards per game. Stewart accounted for 93.5 yards of that total, having carried the ball 170 times for 1,028 yards and 11 touchdowns during the regular season. One of Tennessee's other backup running backs, Jay Graham, was predicted to be {{kept out of the}} game due to an injury, but played after undergoing surgery. Graham, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> 61 times for 275 yards during the regular season, suffered a broken jaw after being punched in the face by a teammate. Because of the injury to Graham, fourth-string running back Ronnie Pillow, who had carried the ball just five times during the regular season, was predicted to back up Stewart during the game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{featured}} {{an unusual}} two-quarterback system on offense, as quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor shared time behind center. Though unusual, {{the system was}} successful in leading the Hokies to their second ACC Championship in fouryears. During the 2007regular season, Glennon threw for 1,636yards and 11touchdowns, completing 63percent of his passes. Taylor, meanwhile, passed for 916yards and fivetouchdowns while also rushing for 431yards. Some pundits predicted that Kansas might have difficulty with Taylor's mobility, as his style of play {{was similar to that}} of Missouri's Chase Daniel, who gave Kansas its sole loss of the 2007season. On {{the other end of the}} Virginia Tech aerial offense was a corps of capable receivers, led by senior wide receivers Eddie Royal and Josh Morgan. Morgan was the fifth-ranked receiver in Virginia Tech history, having earned 1,787receiving yards. Royal was sixth, having earned 1,767yards. Two of Tech's other receivers, Josh Hyman and Justin Harper, recorded 1,138and 1,274receiving yards each, marking the first time in Virginia Tech history that the Hokies had four different thousand-yard career receivers on the same team. On the ground, the Hokies were led by running back Branden Ore, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> for 876yards and eighttouchdowns during the regular season. One week before the Orange Bowl, Tech coaches revealed that Ore would be suspended for the first quarter of the game against Kansas as punishment for showing up late to the Hokies' final pre-bowl practice. Ore was replaced by sophomore rusher Kenny Lewis Jr.|$|E

5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, <b>who</b> <b>rushed</b> several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E
