500|$|After Bowie married Iman in {{a private}} {{ceremony}} in 1992, he said they knew that their [...] "real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience of up to one billion people. In 1993, Bowie said he had an [...] "undying" [...] belief in the [...] "unquestionable" [...] existence of God. Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists [...] "is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it <b>worries</b> <b>me.</b> There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give {{me a couple of}} months.... I've nearly got it right. In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali [...] "in accordance with the Buddhist rituals".|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it <b>worries</b> <b>me,</b> keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E
500|$|With Atkinson thus occupied, an {{alternative}} arrangement {{to pick up}} Scott was necessary. Disregarding Meares, who was [...] "not available for work", the most qualified person available to meet Scott's party was the physicist Wright, an experienced traveller and navigator, but the chief scientist Simpson insisted Wright's scientific work be given priority. Atkinson therefore chose Cherry-Garrard, who could however not navigate, had never handled a dog before and who was moreover short-sighted. Lt Evans wrote later that he thought Scott would have approved the decision to keep Wright at the base camp, whereas Wright later stated [...] "It always <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> - I should have had that job". Cherry-Garrard would be accompanied by Dimitri. In his 1922 book The Worst Journey, Cherry-Garrard recalled the controversial verbal orders given by Atkinson. He was to travel to One Ton Depot as fast as possible, where he was to leave food for the returning polar party. If Scott had not arrived before him, Cherry-Garrard should decide [...] "what to do". Atkinson also emphasised {{that this was not}} a rescue party, and added that Scott had given instructions that the dogs were [...] "not to be risked in view of the sledging plans for next season". In the standard edition of his book, Cherry omitted any mention of Scott's request to be picked up at 82° or 82°30' on 1 March. But after Atkinson's and Lady Scott's deaths in 1929 and 1947 respectively, in a postscript to his privately published 1948 edition, Cherry acknowledged the existence of Scott's order and provided reasons why Atkinson, and later he himself, failed to comply: Cherry-Garrard in 1948 stated that Atkinson was too exhausted at the beginning of February to set off to meet Scott, and that the lack of dog food at One Ton Depot made a timely start impractical. Karen May of the Scott Polar Research Institute goes further by suggesting that the instruction about saving the dogs for the following season was Atkinson's own invention.|$|E

2500|$|However, in 2006, Dobson said that, while [...] "there is disillusionment {{out there}} with Republicans" [...] and [...] "that <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> greatly," [...] he {{nonetheless}} suggested voters turn out and vote Republican in 2006. [...] "My first inclination was to sit this one out," [...] but according to The New York Times, Dobson then added that [...] "he had changed his mind {{when he looked at}} who would become the leaders of Congressional committees if the Democrats took over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although no {{suspicious}} packages {{have yet}} been found, RCALB claimed in January 2009 to Indybay that they sent two UC Davis animal researchers letter bombs {{because of their}} work at the California National Primate Research Center. One of the researchers targeted said, [...] "It <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> a little bit... I mean, anytime someone threatens you physically I think it causes worry." [...] The Animal Liberation Brigade said in a communique re-released by the Animal Liberation Press Office that the act was not a hoax, with officials at the primate center claiming threats and protests have happened before and were unacceptable.|$|E

[...] The Press listed three sitting councillors who had possible mayoral aspirations: Peter Beck, Tim Carter, and Glenn Livingstone. [...] All three were in their first term, with Beck first elected in a February 2012 by-election. In a follow-up article in November, The Press added Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce chief executive Peter Townsend and radio host Mike Yardley to the list of potential mayoral candidates.|$|E

2500|$|One major {{argument}} against the one-state solution {{is that it would}} endanger the safety of the Jewish minority, because it would require assimilation with what critics fear would be an extremely hostile Muslim ruling majority. In particular, Jeffrey Goldberg points to a 2000 Haaretz interview with Edward Said, whom he describes as [...] "one of the intellectual fathers of one-statism". When asked whether he thought a Jewish minority would be treated fairly in a binational state, Said replied that [...] "it <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> a great deal. The question of {{what is going to be}} the fate of the Jews is very difficult for me. I really don't know." [...] Students of the Middle East, including New Historian Benny Morris, have argued that the one-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East. Morris has dismissed claims that a binational state would be a secular democratic state and argues it would instead be an authoritarian, fundamentalist state with a persecuted Jewish minority, citing the racism and persecution minorities face throughout the Arab and Muslim world, and in particular, the fact that Jews in Islamic societies were historically treated as second-class citizens and subject to pogroms and discrimination. In his book One State, Two States, he wrote [...] "What Muslim Arab society in the modern age has treated Christians, Jews, pagans, Buddhists, and Hindus with tolerance and as equals? Why should anyone believe that Palestinian Muslim Arabs would behave any differently"? Pointing to specific examples of violence by Palestinian Muslims towards Palestinian Christians, Morris writes that [...] "Western liberals like or pretend to view Palestinian Arabs, indeed all Arabs, as Scandinavians, and refuse to recognize that peoples, for good historical, cultural, and social reasons are different and behave differently in similar or identical sets of circumstances." [...] Morris notes the differences between Israeli Jewish society, which remains largely Westernized and secular, and Palestinian and Israeli-Arab society, which according to Morris is increasingly Islamic and fundamentalist, with secularism in decline. He also pointed to Hamas' 2007 takeover of Gaza, during which Fatah prisoners were shot in the knees and thrown off buildings, and the regular honor killings of women that permeate Palestinian and Israeli-Arab society, as evidence that Palestinian Muslims have no respect for Western values. He thus claimed that [...] "the mindset and basic values of Israeli Jewish society and Palestinian Muslim society are so different and mutually exclusive as to render a vision of binational statehood tenable only in the most disconnected and unrealistic of minds." ...|$|E
