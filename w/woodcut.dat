5|$|Although she was {{a pioneer}} in the white-line <b>woodcut</b> {{technique}} and {{played a role in the}} development of abstract art in the United States, Lazzell's work faded into obscurity for a time. With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, and especially the white-line <b>woodcut,</b> Lazzell's popularity has surged lately. On August 3, 2012, Lazzell's print 'Sail Boat' reached a staggering $106,200 at auction.|$|E
5|$|M. C. Escher's <b>woodcut</b> Dream {{depicts a}} human-sized mantis {{standing}} on a sleeping bishop. The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>woodcut</b> was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's <b>woodcut</b> is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his <b>woodcut</b> in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

40|$|This article {{identifies}} the potential {{models of the}} artist Hans Weiditz when designing the <b>woodcuts</b> for the first print of the first German translation of "Celestina" (Augsburg, Sigismund Grimm and Max Wirsung, 1520). A detailed comparison between the <b>woodcuts</b> of the German translation and the <b>woodcuts</b> of the Spanish and Italian "Celestinas" printed before 1520 leads {{to the conclusion that}} Hans Weiditz necessarily knew the <b>woodcuts</b> of the Burgos’ "Comedia" and of the illustrated "Tragicomedias" that follow the pictorial scheme of Jacobo Cromberger...|$|R
5|$|In 1925, artist Margaret Preston {{produced}} a hand-coloured <b>woodcut</b> depicting waratahs. The species also appeared on an Australian 3 shilling stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large <b>woodcut</b> with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this <b>woodcut</b> can be seen in a video recording.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece <b>woodcut</b> for the partridge. The <b>woodcut</b> shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Map of Venice, he {{produced}} two other <b>woodcuts,</b> both {{of men and}} satyrs, which were {{the largest and most}} impressive figurative <b>woodcuts</b> yet produced, and which established the Italian tradition of fine, large, <b>woodcuts</b> for the following decades. These may have also been produced before 1500; they are clearly strongly influenced by Mantegna.|$|R

5000|$|A {{theme that}} is {{presented}} in luboks is paganism and other religious elements. Some of the <b>woodcuts</b> refer to sorcery and create links to pagan cosmology.

5|$|Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell's {{original}} woodcuts, {{bearing the}} earlier date of 1 January 1750, and were reprinted in 1790 by John Boydell, but examples from {{either of the}} <b>woodcut</b> printings are uncommon.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} <b>woodcut,</b> Study for Stars, {{completed}} in August 1948, depicts wireframe versions {{of several of}} the same polyhedra and polyhedral compounds, floating in black within a square composition, but without the chameleons. The largest polyhedron shown in Study for Stars, a stellated rhombic dodecahedron, is also one of two polyhedra depicted prominently in Escher's 1961 print Waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{designed}} the distinctive dust jacket– {{a collage of}} newspaper articles in four languages– to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news. The frontispiece is a <b>woodcut</b> portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining {{more than half the}} print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell.

5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{illustrated}} in 1560 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Nomenclator Aquatilium Animantium—Gesner mistook the mushroom for a marine organism. It {{appeared in a}} <b>woodcut</b> in John Gerard's 1597 Great Herball, shortly thereafter in Carolus Clusius 1601 Fungorum in Pannoniis Observatorum Brevis Historia, {{and was one of}} the species featured in Cassiano dal Pozzo's museo cartaceo ("paper museum") that consisted of thousands of illustrations of the natural world.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of <b>woodcut</b> illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E

5000|$|In 1915 and 1916, Wach {{created a}} series of <b>woodcuts</b> showing the horror of war. Postcard-size <b>woodcuts</b> such as Ein Totentanz von 1914 ('A Dead Dance of 1914') and Straße der Schicksale ('Road of Destiny') depict an industrialized war of detonating bullets and dying soldiers. Wach served in World War I in non-combative assignments. In 1916/7, he {{published}} seven <b>woodcuts</b> to accompany a poem called Kriegstotentanz 1914, by an otherwise unknown poet named F.R.

50|$|Gauguin reprised {{the theme}} in a pastel (from {{which there are}} two counterproofs recorded), in a lithograph, and in several <b>woodcuts,</b> {{one of which is}} part of the {{innovative}} suite of <b>woodcuts</b> he prepared for his travelogue Noa Noa.|$|R
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, Dürer's image {{appeared}} in school textbooks in Germany as a faithful {{image of the}} rhinoceros; and it remains a powerful artistic influence. It {{was one of the}} inspirations for Salvador Dalí; a reproduction of the <b>woodcut</b> hung in his childhood home and he used the image in several of his works.|$|E
5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with <b>woodcut</b> (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in a small}} farming {{community}} in West Virginia, Lazzell traveled to Europe twice, studying in Paris with French artists Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, and André Lhote. In 1915, she began spending her summers in the Cape Cod art community of Provincetown, Massachusetts, and eventually settled there permanently. She {{was one of the}} founding members of the Provincetown Printers, a group of artists who experimented with a white-line <b>woodcut</b> technique based on the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints.|$|E

50|$|Membership {{gradually}} grew, to 248 in 1875, and 692 in 1890, {{and several}} regional unions merged into it: the London Mill Sawyers and Wood Cutting Machinists' Society, the Scottish <b>Woodcutting</b> Machinemen's Society, and the Yorkshire United Steam Sawyers and <b>Woodcutting</b> Machinists' Society. Early in the 1910s, it {{changed its name}} to the Amalgamated Society of Mill Sawyers and <b>Woodcutting</b> Machinists, then to the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists of Great Britain and Ireland, before returning to the ASWM name in 1919.|$|R
