40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dimensioning}} of a just-in-time (JIT) parts feeding system, for a paced assembly line. Specifically, we consider the quite frequent case of an old-fashioned, push-oriented <b>warehouse</b> <b>arrangement,</b> characterized by materials and subassemblies that are stocked in different and peripheral areas of the manufacturing plant. In these circumstance, layout changes are almost impossible and warehouses cannot be substituted by supermarkets. Nevertheless, this does not preclude the possibility to rationalize material flow and to reduce work in process (WIP) using a JIT parts feeding system. To this aim, we propose two alternative approaches, differentiating {{in terms of the}} order with which warehouses and workstations are visited. In order to dimension both systems and to estimate their expected performances, a mathematical model is also presented. At first, the model is presented in a basic formulation, which is very effective and easy to use. A more sophisticated formulation, based on Bayesian probability, is introduced next; this is not so much for practical purposes, but rather to demonstrate the potential of the proposed JIT system in very constrained operating settings...|$|R
50|$|Management of {{warehousing}} {{was another}} factor. Originally each production department {{had its own}} <b>warehousing</b> <b>arrangements</b> but this seems to have led to difficulties. To overcome these difficulties the Company {{had set up a}} 'Logistics' department in 1990. Though its area of responsibilities is not made clear in the HSE Report, it seems reasonable to assume that the chief responsibilities of the department were (1) receiving and storing raw materials, (2) storing, packaging and dispatching finished materials, (3) transporting raw materials from store to the point of production and (4) for taking finished chemicals from the point of production into store. It seems also to have had the responsibility for transporting and storing some intermediate products. The magnitude of these operations was disclosed by the 125 people employed in the department. However none of those employed in the Logistics department was qualified in chemistry. This was no doubt the reason why the errors in the classification of AZDN was not noticed. Nor was anyone in the Logistics department qualified in safety.|$|R

Customer needs are sought {{to be met}} reducing lead times thereby leading to enhanced delivery with quality standards and reasonable prices kept in mind. Demands from the customers may vary from time to time. Considering the historical as well as interpreted data and analyzing all factors involved, firms/organizations can forecast what the trade scenario in the future. This helps any organization in systemizing their products/services, managing inventories, <b>warehousing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> All this leads to positive growth for both suppliers and buyers in the long run. Supply chain management (SCM) has been the dominant research paradigm {{of the last few}} decades. Considerable efforts have been put forth in developing decision models for solving supply chain related problems. We focus our attention on these models and optimize them because they address the important aspects of SCM and illustrate different modeling approaches. This paper illustrates the existing SCM decision models and improves upon them, illustrate their applications in global SCM, and identify areas of competitive research in the future. In this paper, we focus on integrating decisions across the supply chain network from the decision models, which are: buyer-supplier relationships, supplier selection, market integrated distributions and market share. Buyer-Supplier relationships lead the basis for continued growth and more possible profit for the system. Choosing the right supplier for the demand requested has its merits and this can be seen periodically in the company's progress chart. To further minimize costs and delivery time, and maximize quality, an optimization tool is used to generate this data for validation with a case study.

These exchanges are aimed at enhancing efficiencies of the existing value chain of commodities by developing appropriate platforms for modern spot markets, financing of commodities based on credible <b>warehouse</b> management <b>arrangements,</b> reducing transaction costs, supporting Futures Exchanges, regulators and the Government with standardized and structured spot markets for compulsory delivery in all agri-commodities. Successful operation of such technologiesdriven initiatives require congenial policy support as these are largely governed under the state laws of APMC. From the case study of NCDEX SPOT market in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka state, it has been observed that for facilitating the small and marginal farmers in participating in new age marketing system, it is required that all the stakeholders work seamlessly in an integrated manner, which are state agencies (warehousing, APMC, Mandi, Board, etc.), financial institutions, other infrastructural facilities, etc. With the help of NCDEX SPOT, tur grower-farmers in the Karnataka states are able to reduce the marketing cost by 50 - 70 per cent and are also able to sell their produce, whenever they want by paying a small charge for warehousing. It is also evident that the farmers could realize, on an average, 5 - 10 per cent higher price for their produce as compared to traditional APMC market. Although the business model seems to be working successfully and showing reasonable confidence to all the stakeholders, requires for upscaling across the board customization according to the law of land of respective states.

40|$|Indoor {{service robots}} {{have been under}} {{research}} and development for decades, but still can not be widely applied. Lack of autonomy {{is one of the}} critical factors which limit the application of indoor service robots. Unlike industry production line robots, indoor service robots require highly accurate localization ability for navigation and automation. Commonly used GPS localization algorithms can not be applied in indoor environments, because the indoor satellite signals are too weak for localization. Different technologies have been employed to provide robots with indoor localization abilities. Infrared sensors, Radio Frequency ID (RFID), ultrasonic sensors, laser range finders and visual cameras all have been successfully developed to provide indoor localization solutions. Except the concerns like measurements’ accuracy, size, cost to deploy, most of these localization solutions can only locate robots relevant to indoor objects, for instance walls, doors and cabinets. The localization information lacks a reference to the whole building or at least the floor where robots are working. This thesis aims to develop an indoor localization system which can provide cheap, easy to access, reliable, accurate localization information with the reference to the whole floorplan. With the development of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), many researchers have developed the indoor localization systems based on WLAN. Angle of Arrival (AOA), Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Time of Arrival (TOA) are three commonly used WLAN indoor localization technologies. With the consideration of accuracy and difficulty to apply among different WLAN localization methods, One Way Propagation Time (OWPT), which is a sub-category of TOA, was developed to an accurate and low cost indoor localization system. In all the reviewed literatures, no research was found which aimed to develop an OWPT localization system for WLAN. The OWPT measurement algorithms in this thesis provide a potential for achieving sub-meter indoor localization accuracy, which is more precise than most other localization methods. Based on OWPT localization algorithms, a WLAN OWPT indoor localization system is presented {{at the end of the}} thesis which can continuously provide robots with accurate and robust localization information in indoor environments. The developed OWPT algorithms contain two parts: one is Synchronization between Access Points (AP) and Mobile Station (MS); another is OWPT Measurement Precision Improvement. According to 802. 11 protocols, every AP in a WLAN transmits beacon frames periodically. A beacon frame contains its transfer time from an AP and that AP’s identification: Basic Service Set ID (BSSID). A MS can record the beacon frame’s arrival time. The beacon frame’s OWPT is calculated from these two recorded times. There are two challenges in the application of OWPT measurements in a WLAN. Firstly, the AP clock and the MS clock need to be highly synchronized before calculating OWPT. Secondly, an ordinary 802. 11 WLAN APs’ time precision is 1 microsecond (μs) which corresponds to 30 meters (m) localization precision. The proposed OWPT algorithms utilize μs precision transfer times and nanosecond (ns) precision arrival times to synchronize the MS and AP clocks and measure a beacon frame’s OWPT with ns precision. A One-AP-One-MS simulation model was built to simulate transmission of beacon frames from an AP to a MS. The viability of the proposed OWPT algorithms was verified in the simulation model. Simulation results indicated that the proposed algorithms could refine WLAN OWPT measurements to meet the ns precision required. When the proposed algorithms were further verified in experiments, hardware limitations were exposed. Due to the lack of highly accurate onboard timers, the ordinary wireless adapter wireless adapters could not record beacon frame arrival times with ns precision. To test the proposed algorithms experimentally, an software timer and oscilloscope were employed to record beacon frames arrival time with ns precision respectively. Test results are detailed and analysed in the thesis. The presented OWPT measurement algorithms will not only benefit indoor service robots, but also provide a low cost indoor localization solution for other indoor services which based on locations, for example <b>warehouse</b> <b>arrangement,</b> customer information access, entertainment etc. Further research is needed to improve hardware timers’ precision on either wireless adapters or computers to record beacon frame arrival time with ns precision. The combination of a ns precision hardware clock and the proposed OWPT measurement algorithms will allow effective implementation of high precision OWPT measurement in WLAN for indoor localization.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Department of Health’s management of the National Medical Stockpile. Audit objective, criteria and scope The audit objective was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Department of Health’s management of the National Medical Stockpile. To assist in evaluating the department’s performance in terms of the audit objective, the ANAO developed the following high level criteria: 	the Department of Health has sound governance arrangements in place for the management of the Stockpile, including an integrated and systematic approach to risk management and performance reporting; 	the Department of Health’s procurement and contract management arrangements for the Stockpile demonstrate a focus on getting the right outcomes and achieving value for money; 	the Stockpile’s inventory management system reflects value for money—it provides an assurance that the right items in the correct amount are being purchased, and stored appropriately, until they are either deployed, or they are disposed of on expiry; and 	the deployment plans and processes provide a high level of assurance that the Stockpile can be reliably deployed within agreed timeframes to agreed locations. The ANAO did not assess processes for the disposal or destruction of expired stock. While the audit examined aspects of the deployment strategy for the Stockpile, it did not seek to assess Australia’s general preparedness to respond to a national health emergency. Nor did the audit assess the clinical efficacy of stockpiled items. An ANAO performance audit in 2007 – 08 on Australia’s pandemic preparedness concluded that the Stockpile was established without high level planning, assessment of risks and an appropriate management framework. The ANAO recommended a shift from a short term ‘supply and store’ strategy for the Stockpile to a longer term management strategy. The current audit was not intended to assess implementation of all the earlier audit recommendations. However, {{in the course of the}} audit the ANAO considered the extent to which the Department of Health has implemented recommendations relating to the Stockpile. Overall conclusion The maintenance of the National Medical Stockpile (the Stockpile) since 2002 represents a significant government investment in the nation’s preparedness for public health emergencies resulting from terrorist activities or natural causes such as pandemics; with over $ 750  million allocated for the Stockpile in the past decade. In 2012 – 13 the Stockpile comprised 42 products and over 110  million items, with a reported value of almost $ 196  million. The effective management of this large strategic reserve, comprising pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment with a limited shelf life, relies on planning and administrative arrangements geared to: select and procure appropriate items; warehouse and control the stock; and deal with expiring items. Effective deployment arrangements are also required to augment state and territory reserves of items from the Stockpile in a timely manner. Overall, the Department of Health’s management of the National Medical Stockpile has been generally effective in recent years, benefiting from improvements introduced since 2010. There remains scope, however, for improving the department’s strategic framework, operational management and deployment arrangements for the Stockpile. Since 2007, when the ANAO concluded that the department had not developed an appropriate framework for managing the Stockpile, the Department of Health has implemented a more structured management approach, including: the development of strategic and operational risk management plans in 2010; the rationalisation of previously fragmented storage contracts in 2010; the application of an evidence‑based approach for the selection of appropriate stockpile items; and the maintenance of formal deployment arrangements with states and territories. Strategies have also been adopted or examined for the cost‑effective replenishment and disposal of expired stockpile items. However, there remains scope for improving key elements of the department’s management arrangements, including: updating the strategic and operational risk management plans; clarifying aspects of the storage contracts to strengthen reporting and performance monitoring; improving the integrity of data used to manage the stockpile; and planning to test Stockpile deployment arrangements. Key issues relating to the Stockpile’s strategic framework, operational management and deployment are discussed in the following paragraphs. The department adopted a more strategic approach to the Stockpile’s management with the introduction of a strategic plan in 2010, albeit some eight years after the Stockpile was established. While the plan broadly describes the governance, funding and administrative arrangements for the Stockpile, it should be updated to identify objectives, priorities and strategies for the Stockpile’s management—key elements of a strategic plan. High level outcomes for the Stockpile agreed to in 2011 by the then Government should also be reflected in an updated plan. Operational management of the Stockpile benefited from the introduction of an operational risk management plan in 2010, which should be updated to reflect risks identified in the Department of Finance’s 2011 Strategic Review of the Stockpile. Operational management was further improved with the consolidation of <b>warehousing</b> <b>arrangements</b> into two longer‑term contracts with logistics firms, relating to pharmaceutical items and personal protective equipment. However, management reports have not been regularly provided, as required under the contracts, and the department should clarify reporting obligations. Further, there is scope to address weaknesses in some system controls and shortcomings in manual processing, which have contributed to the emergence of data integrity issues such as discrepancies between information held in the Stockpile database and warehouse system records. The department has developed a deployment framework with states and territories, although these arrangements have not been recently tested. To provide assurance that deployment arrangements will be effective in a national health emergency, the department should undertake planning to test deployment arrangements, in consultation with other jurisdictions. While there remains scope for further improvement as indicated above, the department’s work in recent years demonstrates a more active approach to management of the Stockpile, as does the recent focus on the findings of the 2011 Strategic Review. The ANAO has made four recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of the department’s management of the Stockpile, by: improving strategic planning and risk management; enhancing performance reporting by contractors; reviewing information management arrangements; and planning to test deployment arrangements...|$|R
40|$|On Four Corners {{this week}} RODNEY TIFFEN {{revealed}} how Malcolm Turnbull derailed Kerry Packer’s ambitions for the Fairfax empire. Here {{he describes the}} events surrounding the falling-out between Packer and Turnbull, {{which led to a}} victory for media diversity FEW if any media issues in Australian history have provoked such a widespread and strong public response as Kerry Packer 2 ̆ 7 s 1991 bid to buy 14. 99 per cent of Fairfax as part of the Tourang syndicate with the (now disgraced) Canadian press proprietor Conrad Black and the American private equity group, Hellman and Friedman. Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser had barely spoken {{to each other in the}} 16 years following the vice-regal dismissal of Whitlam’s government in November 1975, but in 1991, for the first time ever, they shared a political platform to oppose this threat of yet further media concentration. Both signed a protest letter, organised by former National Party minister Peter Nixon, and also signed by his former leader Doug Anthony, as well as a range of former senior politicians. Large rallies were held in Melbourne and Sydney. All concentrated on the negative consequences for Australian democracy, which with Murdoch’s domination already had the most highly concentrated press ownership in the democratic world. But there is no doubt personal antipathy to Packer himself also played a major part. As his biographer Paul Barry reported, Packer “appeared to hate journalists, had a record of punching cameramen, and was ever ready to sue reporters who wrote about him. ” At times, he had been an interventionist proprietor, who enjoyed throwing his corporate weight around, and who sometimes had compromised journalistic professionalism. Realising that he was losing the public relations war, Packer appeared on his channel’s A Current Affair, where he said the idea of owning part of Fairfax amused him. Members of parliament were less amused. The following afternoon a bipartisan petition gathered 128 signatures of the 224 federal MPs within a matter of hours. Public opinion itself was insufficient to stop the bid, but it was becoming increasingly unpalatable for the government to do nothing. The Hawke government called on a House of Representatives inquiry (in which, in contrast to a Senate inquiry, it could still control the numbers). Packer’s appearance before the committee was televised live and has entered Australian folklore. Viewed retrospectively, many of his assertions were at the least questionable, playing to populist prejudices, but more than the content, it was the commanding tone that impressed. He overwhelmed the MPs’ questioning by both fair means and foul, simply ruling some areas out of bounds, for example, and sometimes treating elected representatives with contempt. Paul Barry concluded that “Packer was not just frightening, he was frighteningly smart. As a public performer he was quite breathtaking. ” Indeed, it was such a riveting performance that it was mentioned many times in the paeans of praise following Packer’s death, and surrounding his memorial service. None of these, however, commented how just three weeks after this apparently wonderful performance, Packer had to abandon his goal for Fairfax. When the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Peter Westerway, appeared before the same committee a few weeks later, he announced an inquiry into the takeover. The inquiry was into whether as a member of the Tourang syndicate Packer would be in a position to exercise some control and so be in breach of the cross-media laws. Two days after Westerway’s statement, Packer announced his withdrawal from the bid. In crucial ways, Packer had mismanaged his bid. Apart from the issue of media monopoly, and hostility based upon his own record, Packer’s major political problem was the central involvement of two people perceived to be doing his bidding. The Tourang consortium’s designated new chief of Fairfax newspapers was Trevor Kennedy, who had worked for the Packers for almost two decades. Also publicly prominent was Malcolm Turnbull, who had worked many years for Packer before becoming a merchant banker. Ironically, despite the public perception that these two were Packer stooges, what eventually caused Packer’s failure was the internal pressure put on them, and Packer’s failure to support them. The two executives from Tourang’s foreign companies, Brian Powers and Dan Colson, took command of many aspects of the bid, and sought to overturn agreements Packer had earlier reached with both Kennedy and Turnbull. Packer conspicuously failed to stand up for them. The first to go was Kennedy, who unexpectedly resigned in mid-October. Publicly he blamed the “McCarthyist” campaign against Packer, but this hid the tensions inside the camp, which were the real reason for his departure. Turnbull was involved in the bid because of a shrewd tactical move he had made. As Fairfax, sinking under the self-inflicted debt incurred by Warwick Fairfax’s privatisation, slid towards bankruptcy, it had sold junk bonds in the US. Turnbull saw that this group was a key to future control of the company, and he had the entrepreneurial vision and energy to secure control of them. He teamed up with an initially reluctant Packer and the other Tourang partners. Like Packer, Turnbull had been vocal in expressing what he saw as the shortcomings of Fairfax journalists. The other Tourang partners saw Turnbull as a political and management problem. At the parliamentary inquiry, Packer had been insultingly dismissive about his participation, saying there would be no future role for him, except that he desperately wanted to be a director of Fairfax. When the Tourang partners were putting pressure on Turnbull in November, Packer refused even to return his telephone calls. Turnbull later told Four Corners that he no longer considered Packer a friend, that Packer’s behaviour had ended 17 years of friendship. Eventually Turnbull resigned. Westerway’s appearance in parliament came a few days later. What sealed Packer’s fate in the announcement of the inquiry was the precision with which Westerway identified the documents the tribunal would subpoena. Kennedy had made notes at key moments during the enterprise, including a long record straight after his resignation. These notes revealed that privately Kennedy had the exact opposite understanding of Packer’s role from what he (and Packer) had said publicly, including to the inquiry. In Kennedy’s notes, Packer did intend to exercise control, and had <b>warehousing</b> <b>arrangements</b> regarding some shares that would have taken him over the limit prescribed by the cross-media laws. It was clear that Westerway must have had an internal source to know these documents existed. He has refused to publicly identify this “prominent public figure,” except to say it wasn’t Kennedy. In addition to Paul Barry’s account of these events (The Rise and Rise of Kerry Packer), Neil Chenoweth’s more recent book (Packer’s Lunch) adds some graphic detail. Westerway waited in a parked car in a darkened street in North Sydney on a Sunday night to meet this source, who had said that “he, his wife and his family were all at risk. ” In these melodramatic circumstances the key documents were handed over. Having received them unofficially, Westerway was able to demand them officially to use as evidence. Westerway’s source was none other than Malcolm Turnbull, who, whatever his motives, which were probably several but certainly included getting the best deal for his clients, performed a service for Australian democracy by effectively sinking Packer’s bid. According to Barry, Packer later accused Turnbull and Kennedy of “treason. ” Rather the whole attempt, and its failure, betrays more of his born-to-rule arrogance, and his dishonesty. Three weeks earlier, he had emphatically and repeatedly denied to the parliamentary inquiry that he would exercise any control over Fairfax. You are either going to have to believe me or call me a liar, he said. It was riveting television, silencing his questioners, and spoilt only by the fact that he was lying. Moreover, just three weeks later, he was effectively caught out. Luckily for him, the extent of his dishonesty never came into public focus. But the tribunal’s demand for the key documents was enough to undo him. When Packer’s hagiographers talk of his triumph before the parliamentary committee, it should be recalled that it was no coincidence that three weeks later, his quest for Fairfax ended in failure. • Rodney Tiffen is professor of government and international relations at the University of Sydney.
