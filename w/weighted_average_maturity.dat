40|$|In {{fixed income}} analysis, {{duration}} plays {{a central role}} {{as a proxy for}} interest rate risk exposure. Although this role relies on the interpretation of duration as (minus) the yield elasticity of the bond price, duration is measured as a bond's present value <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> time to <b>maturity</b> and expressed in terms of years.

50|$|Modified {{duration}} {{measures the}} size of the interest rate sensitivity. Sometimes we can be misled into thinking that it measures which part of the yield curve the instrument is sensitive to. After all, the modified duration (% change in price) is almost the same number as the Macaulay duration (a kind of <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> years to <b>maturity).</b> For example, the annuity above has Macaulay duration of 4.8 years and we might think that it is sensitive to the 5-year yield. But it has a cash flows out to 10 years and thus will be sensitive to 10-year yields. If we want to measure sensitivity to parts of the yield curve we need to consider key rate durations.|$|R

50|$|The {{sensitivity}} of {{a portfolio of}} bonds such as a bond mutual fund to changes in interest rates can also be important. The average duration of the bonds in the portfolio is often reported. The duration of a portfolio equals the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> {{of all of the}} cash flows in the portfolio. If each bond has the same yield to maturity, this equals the weighted average of the portfolio's bond's durations, with weights proportional to the bond prices. Otherwise the weighted average of the bond's durations is just a good approximation, but it can still be used to infer how the value of the portfolio would change in response to changes in interest rates.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has referred {{to the concept of}} strategic default {{in the context of the}} syndicate structure and pricing of various loan instruments. Despite such references and imputed effects in the syndicated loan market, no study to our knowledge has specifically quantified the strategic default variable. Our study first identifies a latent variable entitled the propensity to strategically default. A latent variable is a hypothesized and unobserved concept that can only be approximated by observable or measured variables. We then combine this propensity to strategically default variable with a sample of loans that experience an amendment favorable to the borrower. Our identification of a strategic default is the combination of the propensity latent variable and a borrower-favorable amendment. If our measure of strategic default is legitimate and the loan market responds in a manner prescribed by previous studies, we should observe subsequent syndicate structure to be less concentrated, the loan having higher credit spreads and shorter <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> deal <b>maturities.</b> The status of the paper is as follows.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the price {{sensitivity}} of fixed-income securities to the interest rate changes, expressing a dominant source of financial risk the financial institutions or other market participants manage. The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the Macaulay's duration normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>maturity</b> of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the bond redemption prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fun- damental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the scheduled principal payment date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's dura- tion approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities...|$|E

40|$|The <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular {{approach}} to combining multiple forecasts of some future outcome. This paper shows that both for probability or real-valued forecasts, a non-trivial <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of different forecasts is always sub-optimal. More specifically, it is not consistent with any set of information about the future outcome even if the individual forecasts are. Furthermore, <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> does not behave as if it collects information from the forecasters and hence needs to be extremized, that is, systematically transformed away from the marginal mean. This paper proposes a linear extremization technique for improving the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of real-valued forecasts.
