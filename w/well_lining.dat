It is said that in the Kyōhō era, when several onikuma were killed, each skin when spread out covered an area of six tatami mats (about 10 square meters) or more.|$|E

The Brown's <b>Well</b> <b>line</b> was eventually extended to Barmera in 1928, and had several branches with trains that operated back to Tailem Bend. Trains on the Peebinga, Loxton, Moorook and Waikerie lines all passed through Tailem Bend. On 27 June 1926, locomotive servicing facilities were opened including a roundhouse.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Directed line {{segments}} are fundamental geometric elements used to model through their spatial relations such concepts as divergence, confluence, and interference. A new model is developed that captures spatial relations between pairs of directed {{line segments}} through the intersections of the segments ’ heads, bodies, and tails. This head-body-tail intersection identifies 68 classes of topological relations between two directed line segments highlighting two equal-sized subsets of corresponding relations that differ {{only by their}} empty and non-empty body-body intersections. The relations ’ con-ceptual neighborhood graph takes {{the shape of a}} torus inside a torus, one for each subset. Another 12 classes of topological relation classes are distinguished if the segments ’ exteriors are considered as <b>well,</b> <b>lining</b> up such that their conceptual neighborhood graph forms another torus that contains the other two tori. These conceptual neighborhoods as well as the relations ’ composition table enable spatial inferences and similarity assessments in a consistent and reasoned manner. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop Smart Cities in India, {{we need to develop}} smart {{technologies}} and smart construction materials. Permeable concrete an innovative material is environment friendly and a smart material which can be used for construction of several structures. In India, the ground water table is decreasing at a faster rate due to reduction in ground water recharge. These days, the vegetation cover is replaced by infrastructure hence the water gets very less opportunity to infiltrate itself into the soil. If the permeable concrete which has a high porosity is used for the construction of pavements, walking tracks, parking lots, <b>well</b> <b>lining,</b> etc. then it can reduce the runoff from the site and help in the ground water recharge. Such type of smart materials will play an important role for Indian conditions where government is putting lot of efforts to implement ground water recharging techniques. During the research work, the runoff for a particular storm was calculated for a bitumen pavement on a sloping ground. Later after studying the various topographical features, the traffic intensity and the rainfall for that particular area, the concrete was designed and tested for the different proportion and thus the mix design for the permeable concrete was finalized based upon its permeability and strength characteristics. Later by using this permeable concrete the infiltration and runoff for the same storm was compared and studied. The research paper will thus give an account of the properties of permeable concrete where it can be used over an existing road...|$|E

The Brown's <b>Well</b> <b>line</b> was the more northerly, and extended into country which had not been developed much before the railway, partly due to the absence of any viable transport route for produce. The original terminus of the Brown's Well railway was at Meribah, not far from the Victorian border.|$|R
