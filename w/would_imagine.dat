5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E
25|$|La Mancha is {{a region}} of Spain, but mancha (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain. Translators such as John Ormsby have {{declared}} La Mancha {{to be one of}} the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> as the home of a courageous knight.|$|E
25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> {{that he was a}} nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
50|$|Though it <b>would</b> be <b>imagined</b> Lacoste-Lebuis had an {{advantage}} {{going to a}} French milieu, he quickly found out {{that was not the}} case.|$|R

500|$|Atlanta's climate {{was cited}} as a {{potential}} issue that would hinder production. Darabont recalled that he {{found it difficult to}} adjust to the sweltering heat, adding that he [...] "never had clothes stick to me like this in my life". Lincoln retorted that it was [...] "becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather." [...] Despite such assertions, he opined that it added to the episode's overall emotion. [...] "There's a lot of hard-earned sweat on camera. It's not comfortable and it's not pleasant, but it's as you <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> it would be trying to survive in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Doggett, Reyes, and Harrison {{camp out}} at the Conlon's house and soon stumble upon the monsters that Tommy sees: large, insect-like creatures that {{multiply}} when shot by bullets. The local sheriff (Steve Ryan) arrives, alerted by Scully, but a scuffle ensues. The sheriff draws a gun, and Doggett punches him, only to have his hand go completely through the man's stomach. Upon investigation, Reyes is unable to find any organs in the man's body. Tommy soon shows Reyes the pictures he has been drawing. They include the sheriff with a gun, insect creatures, and Reyes with an insect creature bursting through her stomach. [...] Reyes asks Tommy why he <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> such things, and Tommy replies it is because he is very scared.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Los Angeles, California with producer Greg Fidelman during October 2008 and then recorded from late January and March 2009. There were 13 songs recorded for the album, but only 11 appear on the album. In May 2009, King said of the album: [...] "I think this one {{has a little bit}} of everything—more so than anything we've done since Seasons. So I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> people are gonna compare it to that one." [...] The band had recorded thirteen songs for the album, seven written by lead guitarist Jeff Hanneman and six by King, although not all of them were included. King later confirmed the album's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009. An article on Slayer's website confirmed the album's name. On August 20, 2009, Roadrunner Records confirmed the track listing. Thom Jurek of Allmusic said the production [...] "takes a different tack altogether for this guitar-manic crew." [...] A listening party for World Painted Blood was held on October 30, 2009 at Duff's Brooklyn in Williamsburg, New York. The event started at 9:00pm ...|$|E

500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} by Sabi at the Wango Tango of 2011. On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, a video interlude {{in which the}} stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees {{the beginning of the}} third section. Spears returns to the stage wearing a golden outfit and performs an Egyptian-inspired version of [...] "Gimme More", containing a barge and fireworks. In her next number, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears is surrounded by her dancers carrying picture frames, and includes an appearance by Sabi in select cities. Sabi revealed she pictured the music video for the song based on the live performance of the tour, saying, [...] "what we do onstage is very Egyptian, Middle Eastern-like feel and a lot of vanity kind of stuff. So I would just imagine what we kind of did for the green screen, where there's mirrors and there's boys that are like oiled up. [...] I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> us in goddess-looking outfits and us looking vain". On August 3, 2011, ABC Family announced that [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] would be available for free download on their website, until the premiere of the Teen Spirit series on August 5, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Dixon, a {{songwriter}} and singer, often writes or co-writes her own records. Discussing {{the writing process}} of The Alesha Show she said, [...] "I've written the majority of it and I co-write as well {{with a lot of}} people". Critics have suggested some of her songs are autobiographical, such as [...] "To Love Again" [...] (2009), co-written with Gary Barlow and John Shanks. Vocally, reviewer Andy Gill of The Independent suggested that Dixon's vocal strengths lie with more up-tempo songs, saying [...] "the problem is that her bubbly personality (and voice) is simply not as well suited to ballads as to perky dancefloor anthems". However, The Guardians Caroline Sullivan complemented her live vocals whilst reviewing her tour, The Alesha Show. She said, of her concert tour, that [...] "it was her singing that made the impression: she's more powerful than you <b>would</b> <b>imagine,</b> and when pitted against her band at their most blaring, she more than held her own. While this was going on, she was being flung between two male hoofers, proving, if nothing else, that pop stars who claim they can't dance and sing simultaneously just aren't trying".|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I <b>would</b> <b>imagine,</b> not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he did so, one <b>would</b> not <b>imagine</b> that he <b>would</b> be {{satisfied}} with blotting-paper," [...] Don Sebastian agreed. [...] "You said there was some coffee on the table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the coffee, mamma,--you <b>would</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{it to be}} {{from the}} same bag with your own, so dark and so bitter; what do you suppose she has done to it?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The former {{princess of}} the {{destroyed}} planet Alderaan, now General of the Resistance, and Luke's twin sister. After {{the events of}} Return of the Jedi, she is described as [...] "a little more battle weary, a little more broken hearted". Fisher described Leia as [...] "Solitary. Under a lot of pressure. Committed as ever to her cause, but I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> feeling somewhat defeated, tired, and pissed." [...] Abrams said: [...] "The stakes are pretty high in the story for her, so there's not much goofing around where Leia's concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Northampton, Worcestershire Royals captain Vikram Solanki {{led from}} the front, scoring 119 off 137 balls, {{including}} 13 fours and 1 six. Support from his colleagues took the visitors up to 211 for 4 off their 45 overs. Worcestershire director of cricket Tom Moody said of Solanki: [...] "I can't see why he won't be in the mix for England section this summer. It depends how the selectors shuffle the deck, but I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> {{he will be in}} their minds for consideration at the very least. We were very confident he was ready for the challenge of captaincy and he has had a great start." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trainer Willie Mullins was gearing Faugheen {{towards a}} future chasing career during his novice season [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> he's a chaser. He wants fences to maybe make him drop the bridle and travel" [...] and having his first career {{win in a}} PTP race which uses similar fences to those used for chase races, the {{transition}} {{was expected to be}} beneficial by Mullins who provided an explanation after his win in the Grade 1 Cheltenham Novices' Hurdle where he made a few jumping errors: [...] "I think he wants fences. He has a disregard for hurdles, he just wants to go. Fences might make him respect things more".|$|E
6000|$|... "Valley Brook is {{the farm}} we live on, and Hope {{is a school}} near Brill," [...] said Sam. [...] "Poor, poor Tom! Who <b>would</b> have <b>imagined</b> {{such a thing as}} this could happen to him!" ...|$|R
60|$|But no one <b>would</b> have <b>imagined</b> {{that such}} an idea {{had come into the}} captain's mind. He worked as earnestly, and as steadily, {{as if he had been}} landing an {{ordinary}} cargo at an ordinary dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Joan, I've {{got such}} a {{wonderful}} thing to tell you about! You <b>would</b> never <b>imagine</b> it. I've had a dream, and in the dream I saw you right here where you are standing now, and" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Snoopy, a {{character}} previously minor, {{began to have}} a gradual increase in appearance, and in the 1960s, he became a major character. The naming of the command module and lunar module for Apollo 10 – [...] "Charlie Brown" [...] and [...] "Snoopy" [...] respectively, as mentioned earlier in this text, is testament to the character's standing at that time. Many of the strips from the 1960s onwards revolve around Snoopy's active, Walter Mitty-like fantasy life, in which he <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> himself in various roles, including a World War I Flying Ace, a World Famous author, and a college student named Joe Cool. Although the names give his imaginary roles self-praise, he fails in his fantasies.|$|E
2500|$|Shuho Sato, {{who wrote}} Umizaru and Say Hello to Black Jack, has created some {{controversy}} on Twitter. Sato says, [...] "Manga school is meaningless because those schools have very low success rates. Then, I could teach novices required skills {{on the job}} in three months. Meanwhile, those school students spend several million yen, and four years, yet they are good for nothing." [...] and that, [...] "For instance, Keiko Takemiya, the then professor of Seika Univ., remarked in the Government Council that 'A complete novice {{will be able to}} understand where is [...] "Tachikiri" [...] (i.e., margin section) during four years.' On the other hand, I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> that, It takes about thirty minutes to completely understand that at work." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Eleuterio Quiñones {{dates from the}} mid-1980s, when {{it was part of}} the lineup for [...] "Rompiendo el día" [...] a morning radio show Logroño used to host with fellow actor and member of the Puerto Rican political satire collective Los Rayos Gamma, Silverio Pérez. The radio station's studios were in Guaynabo, and whenever Logroño entered the building he would see the landscape attendant, an old man, struggling to pull weeds out. Logroño would discuss with Pérez how he <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> the attendant's voice, what would his political persuasion be, and so on. Based on him, Logroño developed the character for his morning show. The show did not survive, but the character was well received by the show's audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then--if he's so--so sensitive, perhaps I'd better go," [...] said Columbine, {{struggling}} with embarrassment and discomfiture. What if {{she happened to}} meet him! <b>Would</b> he <b>imagine</b> her purpose in coming there? Her heart began to beat unwontedly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you could}} have heard him! He thought he had got a working lady at last, {{and he would have}} had no mercy upon you. One <b>would</b> have <b>imagined</b> that Mr. Kendal had brought you here for his sole behoof!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} think it's worth worrying about," [...] said Urmston, reflectively. [...] "For one thing, it's too beautiful a {{night to}} waste in thinking about a Canadian stock-rider. One <b>would</b> hardly <b>imagine</b> any of them are sufficiently interesting to warrant it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Anquetil took a forthright and {{controversial}} {{stand on the}} use of performance-enhancing drugs. He never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> it was possible to ride Bordeaux–Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through [...] "the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said in a television interview, before adding: [...] "Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope." [...] There was implied acceptance of doping right {{to the top of the}} state: the president, Charles de Gaulle, said of Anquetil: [...] "Doping? What doping? Did he or did he not make them play the Marseillaise [...] abroad?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Darger {{settled into}} a second-floor room on Chicago's North Side at 851 W. Webster Avenue in the Lincoln Park section of the city, near the DePaul University campus. It was in this room for the next 43 years that Darger <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> and write his massive tomes (in {{addition}} to a 10-year daily weather journal and assorted diaries) {{until his death in}} April 1973 in St. Augustine's Catholic Mission home (the same institution in which his father had died). In the last entry in his diary, he wrote: [...] "January 1, 1971. I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Avi Primor, {{president}} of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, Grass was the only important German cultural figure who had refused {{to meet with him}} when he served as Israeli ambassador to Germany. Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one <b>would</b> <b>imagine)</b> had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had nothing at all to do with his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not see it that way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Comrade Wilberfloss," [...] he said, [...] "we {{are talking}} at cross-purposes. You keep harping on Comrade White and his views and tastes. One <b>would</b> almost <b>imagine</b> that you fancied that Comrade White was the {{proprietor}} of this paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a lot {{of money}} must be {{invested}} in business here," [...] he thought. [...] "How I would like to be a merchant on such a scale. A person who had never been here <b>would</b> not <b>imagine</b> it was so grand!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tommy nodded, and said, {{sooner than}} one <b>would</b> have <b>imagined</b> {{possible}} under the circumstances, [...] "Oh, don't he, though? And we dance sometimes, and do gymnastics to music. I like a drum myself, and mean {{to learn as}} soon as ever I can." ...|$|R
