5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> of the hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech {{failed to do so}} and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
5|$|Repairs were {{completed}} by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway {{to join the}} forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs.

Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.|$|E

Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was reportedly broken up for scrap over the next two years, according to Western works that did not have access to Soviet documents at the time. The historian Hans Georg Prager examined the former Soviet archives in the early 2000s, and discovered that Lützow actually had been sunk in weapons tests in July 1947.|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer pulled into the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a hydraulic failure. It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg pulled into the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> of his energy recovery system. After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired with brake failure, while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E

25|$|For {{the special}} case where r is an integer, the {{negative}} binomial distribution {{is known as the}} Pascal distribution. It is the probability distribution of a certain number of failures and successes in a series of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. For knbsp&+nbsp&r Bernoulli trials with success probability p, the negative binomial gives the probability of k successes and r failures, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> on the last trial. In other words, the {{negative binomial distribution}} is the probability distribution of the number of successes before the rth failure in a Bernoulli process, with probability p of successes on each trial. A Bernoulli process is a discrete time process, and so the number of trials, failures, and successes are integers.|$|E
25|$|Although the Luftwaffe {{eventually}} allocated {{more resources}} to the coming campaign than the RAF did during the Battle of Britain in 1940, it failed to commit these resources {{at a time when}} the Allied air offensive might have been checked. The Luftwaffes key mistakes in leadership, production and training decisions that eventually cost it the campaign were made in 1940–1942. The German leadership failed to develop a coherent air strategy for a long war. Strategic blindness, operational effectiveness and missteps paired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to assign air defence as a top priority undermined the Luftwaffes efforts in 1943–1945. German strategy, termed the cult of the offensive, worked in 1939–41, but when faced with a war of attrition, the growing power of its enemies, its forces spread thin over four fronts, the failure to develop defensive doctrines, tactics and plans led to defeat.|$|E

He was team-mates with Luke Searle (the son of the owner David Searle), Alan Gurr and Geoff Full in a BMW 320i. A test session at Queensland Raceway in July showed the car was competitive. The drivers qualified 13th but problems arose. During the qualifying, the BMW's engine had been losing power along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> of the fuel filter and the fuel injector jets were blocked. Come the race, the issues were still present until 75 minutes before the race end, but the team did complete 50 laps.

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{explore the}} effect contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart <b>failure</b> nurse {{can have on}} patients' illness beliefs, mood {{and quality of life}}. Background: There is growing {{interest}} in patients' illness beliefs and the part they play in a patients understanding of chronic disease. Design: Secondary analysis on two independent datasets. Patients were recruited from five UK hospitals, four in London and one in Sussex. Patients were recruited from an inpatient and outpatient setting. The first dataset recruited 174 patients with newly diagnosed heart failure, whilst the second dataset recruited 88 patients <b>with</b> <b>an</b> existing diagnosis of heart failure. Methods: Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Treatment Representations Inventory at baseline and six months. We used a linear regression model to assess the association that contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart <b>failure</b> nurse had on mood, illness beliefs and quality of life over a six-month period. Results: Patients who had contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart <b>failure</b> nurse were more satisfied with their treatment and more likely to believe that their heart failure was treatable. Contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart <b>failure</b> nurse did not make a statistically significant difference to mood or quality of life. Conclusions: This study has shown that contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart <b>failure</b> nurse can improve patient satisfaction with treatment decisions but has less influence on a patient's beliefs about their personal control, treatment control and treatment concerns. With appropriate support, skills and training, heart failure nurses could {{play an important role in}} addressing individual patient's beliefs. There is a need to further investigate this. Relevance to clinical practice: Exploring patients' illness beliefs and mood could help to enhance person-centred care. Heart failure nurses would need additional training in the techniques used. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

25|$|At the Belgian Grand Prix, a {{qualifying}} session held {{in mixed}} weather conditions and grid penalties for three drivers allowed {{the team to}} claim its best grid positions of the season, as Senna took 18th, one position ahead of Yamamoto. In the race, however, Senna retired early after suffering a suspension failure which caused him to spin, whilst Yamamoto finished, albeit a place lower than he had started. The Italian Grand Prix that followed {{was held at the}} high-speed Monza circuit, where the F110 was particularly disadvantaged by the team's lack of a low-downforce aerodynamic package. The drivers qualified slowest, with Senna again ahead, and were then elevated a position each when Glock received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. In the race, Senna was another early retirement <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> in his car's hydraulic system, whilst Yamamoto extended his run of finishes with a 19thplace, ahead of Di Grassi, who retired with three laps to go but was classified as a finisher. Yamamoto struck one of his mechanics as he pulled away from his mid-race pit stop, but the man was not seriously injured. During preparation for the Singapore Grand Prix, the team announced that Yamamoto was to be replaced by Klien for the weekend because he was suffering from food poisoning, although several journalists noticed a seemingly healthy Yamamoto in the paddock, indicating that he had been dropped for sponsorship reasons instead. In his first competitive outing since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, Klien outqualified Senna by more than a second; both Hispania cars lined up ahead of Felipe Massa's Ferrari on the grid, as he had failed to set a time during the session. In the race, Klien ran ahead of Senna until Senna collected the crashed Sauber of Kobayashi, who lost control in front of him, on his 30thlap. Klien retired two laps later when his F110's hydraulics failed. Yamamoto returned to the driving seat for his home race in Japan; he qualified a tenth of a second behind Senna on the back row of the grid. In the race, Senna made a pit stop on the first lap, along with several other drivers, in response to a safety-car period caused by two first-lap accidents. Yamamoto, meanwhile, remained on track, keeping Trulli and Glock behind him for until lap15 and his own stop on lap31 respectively, whereupon he dropped behind Senna. The two drivers achieved a double finish, with Senna in 15thposition and Yamamoto in 16th, despite the latter suffering from fuel pressure problems.|$|E
