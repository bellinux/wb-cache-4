5|$|As {{hostilities}} renewed, San Martín organized several guerrilla {{groups in}} the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> as a conqueror to the local population. However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Martín called for an open cabildo to discuss {{the independence of the}} country, which was agreed. With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Martín declared the independence of Peru on 28 July 1821. The war, however, had not ended yet.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the bill {{because he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Justin Spitzer, his 10th writing credit for the series. It was directed by series editor David Rogers, his 4th directing credit for the series. Beginning with this episode, Mindy Kaling was promoted to executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that she might {{not return to the}} series as a writer. The episode features guest appearance from Stephen Collins, Dee Wallace and Josh Groban as Andy's father, mother and brother, respectively. Collins and Wallace were reported to appear on the series by Joyce Eng of TV Guide. Josh Groban was later reported to appear on the series the next day. Writer Mindy Kaling had sent Groban a message through Twitter asking if he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> on the series. He responded yes with the filming week of the episode lining up with his Los Angeles concert for his Straight to You Tour.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} people attempt to {{establish}} and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This might contribute to overly optimistic attitudes.|$|E

25|$|Despite being a noted {{criminal}} on Earth, Luthor is revered on {{the alien}} world of Lexor, where he rediscovered the planet's lost technology and rebuilt society for its inhabitants. He apparently lost {{a fight to}} Superman so that water could be transported to the desert planet, as he had reactivated digging machines but discovered {{he could not find}} water. He and Superman had originally gone to the world to have a proper fight as Superman did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> cowardly after Luthor over a radio challenged him to a fight, as this planet had a red sun meaning Superman lost his powers there. As a result, he becomes a hero in the eyes of Lexor's people, whereas Superman is detested as a villain. He eventually marries a local woman named Ardora,. After its debut, Lexor appears sporadically in various Superman comics as a retreat for Luthor while he continues to wage assaults on Superman.|$|E
25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

She later explained: [...] "When I read it, I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to {{understand}} the script's material." [...] That same year, she co-starred in the comedy film Dick, opposite Michelle Williams.

Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, [...] "We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene", and, [...] "We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us".

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Knowles' debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), rumors spread about a {{possible}} split of Destiny's Child after each member had experienced solo success and had ongoing projects. Comparisons were drawn to Justin Timberlake, who {{did not return to}} band NSYNC after his breakthrough debut solo album, Justified. Rowland responded to such rumors, announcing they were back in the studio together. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen and that their affinity to each other kept them cohesive. Margeaux Watson, arts editor at Suede magazine, suggested that Knowles [...] "does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> disloyal to her former partners," [...] and called her decision to return to the group [...] "a charitable one". Knowles' mother, Tina, wrote a 2002-published book, titled Destiny's Style: Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty and Lifestyle Secrets From Destiny's Child, an account of how fashion influenced Destiny's Child's success.|$|E

[...] Kinoshita was impressed with the integrity of the retainer and invited him to an extended stay in his home, as a guest. [...] Hanbei admitted that the Saitō clan could not survive for much longer under Tatsuoki, and accepted Kinoshita's invitation in exchange for a promise of leniency if ever the Saitō leadership fell into Kinoshita's hands.|$|E
500|$|... "The Old Man and the Key" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who was inspired by an article about senior homes. The article described senior homes as being a lot like high schools, in that there are popular and unpopular people, and that those who, for example, own a car are [...] "like kings". Vitti suggested that the episode should be that [...] "Grampa's life [...] basically {{like that of a}} teenager", with Homer acting as if he was Grampa's father. The Souvenir Jackitos, who challenge Grampa to a death race in the episode, were conceived from an observation by the writers.

500|$|When {{the time}} came to return to a {{recording}} studio, the band looked for a new record producer. Lillywhite, who had done the work for both of their previous albums, had other commitments, and many in the band felt it was time to chart a new course anyway. Columbia Records management first attempted to match the band with David Bowie, who was a high-profile Furs supporter and who expressed enthusiasm for working with them. Bowie, however, also had commitments which would have postponed work for what the band felt would be an unacceptably long time. More importantly, there was a belief among some band members that this partnership would not yield much of a change. According to Richard Butler, [...] "the media were already making lots of comparisons between our music and his", and the band did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> too indebted. An eleventh-hour offer by Lillywhite to fit the band into his schedule was politely declined.|$|E
500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan.

I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Stanton {{originally}} {{wanted to}} juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, {{but he saw}} The Triplets of Belleville (2003) and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> {{as if he were}} copying it. Stanton then thought about the song [...] "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" [...] from Hello, Dolly!, since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included [...] "It Only Takes a Moment" [...] and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. Hello Dolly! composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story [...] "genius". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on Hello, Dolly! ...|$|E

D'Agosta called her a [...] "notorious actress", but said that at the time they saw approaches {{from a wide range of}} actors and actresses who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> on the series.
