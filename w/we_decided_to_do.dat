Curt King, press manager for Friends, commented: [...] "Try {{to think of the}} new shows that were premiered after recent Super Bowls and name one that's still around.

In an {{interview}} with Daily News and Analysis, Pandit discussed the meeting between him and Saria, saying, [...] "He {{had no desire to}} cast me, [...] because he thought I do only commercial films. I had to force it out of him. But when I heard it I found it interesting and <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it". Saria called Ganesh for the table read for the protagonist of the film, Sahil, and was greatly impressed by his approach to the character. However, Ganesh was apprehensive about playing the character, but after initial scepticism he agreed to play the role. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh J. Chaddha play supporting roles in the film. The film marked the last film role for Ganesh, as he died of tuberculosis in January 2015, while the film was in post-production. The opening credits in the film's final cut honour his memory.|$|E

[...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take {{on one of the}} guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E

[...] It was something which both the label and group agreed to. Group member Rochelle Humes explained in an interview with Digital Spy: With regards to recording for the new album the group revealed that they worked with previous collaborators Steve Mac and Ina Wroldsen as well as some new producers. The group would also go on to explain exactly what a mini-album was, [...] "a normal album would maybe consist of 12 or 13 tracks, but here we have eight.

With Human, I felt like I wanted to do more R music and that’s not what <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on that album." [...] The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series [...] further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted in another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Norwood felt not as [...] "creative and forthcoming" [...] as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album.

He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that."

Our focus this time around – rather than create a whole series of chase characters, {{we wanted to make sure}} that we had a wider variety of characters," [...] he said.

On 15 November that year, they issued their debut single, [...] "Hip Hip Hooray", on their label and distributed by MGM Distribution. Angus wrote the track, and contributed guitar, keyboards, bass guitar, drums and lead vocals. It appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top100. In late May, Hesse indicated that a new album was due later that year. However, he left soon after and the group decided that they required a female vocalist, Angus and D met Connie Mitchell (ex-Primary) by chance in a public park as she sat singing and playing guitar to a friend. They asked her to join as lead vocalist, Mitchell later remembered, [...] "I thought they were a bit dodgy ... You know, two guys coming up to you, excited, jumping around a bit, saying 'Come to our studio'".

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009. The band had become {{dissatisfied with the}} music industry and music media, and decided {{to create their own}} record label to release their fourth studio album. Commenting on the dissolving [...] "indie band culture", Weinman stated, [...] "back in the day there were record labels that you trusted, loved and you bought everything on it and you discovered a lot of great new music because of it. You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before you moved onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this ourselves.

The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album.

Cornell performed two of those coinciding with the debut of the album on September 21 and 22, 1999 at the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood California.

40|$|Two dichotomous forces {{continually}} shape artistic {{output in}} our society: individual freedom of artistic expression and the competitive nature of free enterprise. This conflict {{manifests itself in}} every arts arena. Competitive structures have developed in the multiple realms of music education, particularly {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century.

And given our societal and human nature, can music educators dismantle these competitive structures effectively if <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so? Rodney Miller (1993) asserts the following: For art to be art it must be a reflection of our human condition. This is because art is ultimately a subjective communication of emotion, usually emotion affected by or in response to the conditions in which the artist and the subject find themselves. Paradoxically, art very often becomes a casualty of the very social conditions it tries to reflect. One of the most insidious examples of this in our contemporary society is the obsession for competing that has permeated all venues of our society, including our artistic environment.
