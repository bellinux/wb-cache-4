With an extremely high current-density, an arc temperature of 17000 K, and output centered at 170 nm (in the far UV), the blackbody radiation is so intense {{that it has no}} problem penetrating the extremely dark, shade 10 <b>welding</b> <b>lens</b> which the camera is behind.|$|E
40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional welding current controller. The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an after-heat impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the spot <b>weld</b> <b>lens</b> as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the backlash-free threaded spindle which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|R

The fiber attachment process and the fixing of various coupling components have been performed in what is so called active alignment process, where the system continues measuring the coupled power {{during the process of}} coupling and <b>welding</b> of (<b>lens</b> holder, fiber ferrule and welding clips). Nd: YAG laser welding system (LW 4000 S from Newport) has been used for the alignment and welding of the coupling components. We also studied the effect of axial, lateral and angular misalignment on coupling efficiency of the proposed coupling scheme. Our results showed a significant relaxation in misalignment tolerance using ball lens for coupling with optimum coupling efficiency of about 65 % at optimum working distance.

The {{principle}} of laser welding of combined translucent thermoplastic and absorbance thermoplastics is that laser transmit through translucent material and shoot at laser absorptive material, where the material absorb energy and melt down to complete welding. This paper studied {{the applicability of}} basic law of laser transmission welding beam mechanism and light absorption process – Beer-Lamber Law to plastic materials. Numerical simulation model of melting depth was established. Single factor relevance curve and double factor relevance surface were drawn with MATLAB; Impact of laser power, distance between <b>weld</b> zone and <b>lens</b> and scanning speed to melting depth was quantitatively analyzed on melting depth, which provided effective reference for setting parameters in the experiment...|$|R

A guide tube extends externally of the torch and has a free end adjacent to the lip. First and second optical fiber bundle assemblies are supported within the guide tube. Light from a strobe light is transmitted along one of the assemblies to the free end and through the lip onto the <b>weld</b> site. A <b>lens</b> is positioned in the guide tube adjacent to the second assembly and focuses images of the weld site onto {{the end of the}} fiber bundle of the second assembly and these images are transmitted along the second assembly to a video camera so that the weld site may be viewed continuously for monitoring the welding process...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution 3. 0 -cm radar {{data for}} the Rima Bode {{regional}} pyroclastic deposit {{and a number of}} UV-visible reflectance spectra for regional pyroclastic deposits on the north-central portion of the lunar nearside are analyzed and compared to existing data. The data obtained indicate that small craters in this deposit excavated loose unwelded pyroclastic particles, suggesting that <b>welded</b> layers or <b>lenses</b> do not exist at depths within the deposit's core area. The 70 -cm radar data indicate that the Roma Bode deposit is thinner than the pyroclastic unit on the Aristarchus Plateau. The surfaces of all these regional pyroclastic deposits are dominated by ilmenite-rich black spheres, and contamination by low-Ti, nonpyroclastic debris appears to be minimal. The fine-grained block-free uncontaminated Rima Bode would be ideal for lunar mining operations and for rapidly covering lunar base modules with an adequate thickness of shielding material for protection from meteorite impact and space radiation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss some {{investigations}} and analyses of the various parameters, which contribute to increase the coupling efficiency of a laser diode to a single mode fiber-coupling using the lens coupling, which provides a coupling efficiency of about 75 % at the optimum working distance. The separation between the coupling optics and the single mode fiber is in the range of 5 - 10 Î¼m. The alignment during the coupling process and <b>welding</b> of the <b>lens</b> holder, fiber ferrule, and welding clips was carried out using the automated laser welding system, LW 4000 S from Newport. The results of optimizing the laser beam parameters to produce sound welds with small heat affected zones (HAZ) when changes occur in the weld dimensions, {{as a result of a}} change in the laser beam parameters, are also discussed. The weld ability of various metals was checked to determine the suitability for the base material and welding tools for packaging of photonic devices. Â© 2007 Old City Publishing, Inc...|$|R

In 1969 they were used aboard the Eagle, the lunar landing module of Apollo 11, the first manned mission {{to land on the}} Moon. NASA research primarily by scientists James B.

The <b>lenses</b> used colored dyes and small particles of zinc oxide, which absorbs ultraviolet light and is also used in sunscreen lotions. The research was later broadened to further terrestrial applications, e.g., deserts, mountains, and fluorescent-lighted offices, and the technology was commercially marketed by a U.S. company.

40|$|Solidification is an {{important}} aspect of <b>welding,</b> brazing, soldering, <b>LENS</b> fabrication, and casting. The current trend toward utilizing large-scale process simulations and materials response models for simulation-based engineering is driving the development of new modeling techniques. However, the effective utilization of these models is, in many cases, limited by a lack of fundamental understanding of the physical processes and interactions involved. In addition, experimental validation of model predictions is required. We have developed new and expanded experimental techniques, particularly those needed for in-situ measurement of the morphological and kinetic features of the solidification process. The new high-speed, high-resolution video techniques and data extraction methods developed in this work have been used to identify several unexpected features of the solidification process, including the observation that the solidification front is often far more dynamic than previously thought. In order to demonstrate the utility of the video techniques, correlations have been made between the in-situ observations and the final solidification microstructure. Experimental methods for determination of the solidification velocity in highly dynamic pulsed laser welds have been developed, implemented, and used to validate and refine laser welding models. Using post solidification metallographic techniques, we have discovered a previously unreported orientation relationship between ferrite and austenite in the Fe-Cr-Ni alloy system, and have characterized the conditions under which this new relationship develops. Taken together, the work has expanded both our understanding of, and our ability to characterize, solidification phenomena in complex alloy systems and processes...|$|R
