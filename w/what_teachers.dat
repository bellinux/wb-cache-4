The EPI report recommends that measures of performance based on standardized test scores be one factor among many that should be considered to [...] "provide a more accurate view of <b>what</b> <b>teachers</b> in fact do in the classroom and how that contributes to student learning." [...] The study called value-added modeling a fairer means of comparing teachers that allows for better measures of educational methodologies and overall school performance, but argued that student test scores were not sufficiently reliable as a means of making [...] "high-stakes personnel decisions".|$|E

Although the importance of teacher knowledge is acknowledged, {{little is known about}} <b>what</b> types of <b>teacher</b> knowledge are needed for teaching statistics at the primary school level. In this paper, a framework is described that can account for teacher knowledge in relation to statistical thinking. This framework was applied in a study that was conducted in the classrooms of four second-year teachers, and was used to explore the teacher knowledge used in teaching statistics through investigations. As a consequence, descriptions of teacher knowledge are provided and give further understanding of <b>what</b> <b>teacher</b> knowledge is used in the classroom...|$|R
