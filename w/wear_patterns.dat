5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> observed within sauropods, diplodocine <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> of the teeth (coming from toothâ€“food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaur tooth marks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. They have been reported from ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and other tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurid bones with tooth marks represent about 2% of known fossils with preserved tooth marks. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body, rather than knife-like cutting functions.

5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E

25|$|One {{study was}} based on the many Troodon teeth that have been {{collected}} from Late Cretaceous deposits from northern Alaska. These teeth are much larger than those collected from more southern sites, providing evidence that northern Alaskan populations of Troodon grew to larger average body size. The study suggests that the Alaskan Troodons may have had access to large animals as prey because there were no tyrannosaurids in their habitat to provide competition for those resources. This study also provides an analysis of the proportions and <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> of a large sample of Troodon teeth. It proposes that the <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> of all Troodon teeth suggest a diet of soft foods - inconsistent with bone chewing, invertebrate exoskeletons, or tough plant items. This study hypothesizes a diet primarily consisting of meat.|$|E

25|$|While {{studying}} the chewing methods of hadrosaurids in 2009, the paleontologists Vincent Williams, Paul Barrett, and Mark Purnell found that hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation {{close to the}} ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. This conclusion {{was based on the}} evenness of scratches on hadrosaur teeth, which suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items, such as twigs or stems, that might have required a different chewing method and created different <b>wear</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, Purnell said these conclusions were less secure than the more conclusive evidence regarding the motion of teeth while chewing.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{paleontologist}} Mark Purnell {{conducted a}} study into the chewing methods and diet of hadrosaurids from the Late Cretaceous. By analyzing hundreds of microscopic scratches on the teeth of a fossilized Edmontosaurus jaw, the team determined hadrosaurs had a unique way of eating unlike any creature living today. In contrast to a flexible lower jaw joint prevalent in today's mammals, hadrosaurs had a unique hinge between the upper jaws {{and the rest of}} its skull. The team found the dinosaur's upper jaws pushed outwards and sideways while chewing, as the lower jaw slid against the upper teeth. [...] This chewing method is called pleurokinesis. [...] During pleurokinesis, the maxilla bones slide laterally outward from the mouth. This is accomplished with a hinge made of the joints between the premaxilla and maxilla bones and the lacrimal and prefrontal bones. Pleurokinesis allows for the teeth to more precisely grind against one another, for better shearing of plant material, and reduces the stress that chewing puts on the skull. [...] Analysis of the <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> of the teeth has provided further insight into how these animals may have fed. On the teeth, [...] four different sets of <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> can be found that indicate the lower jaw would have moved directly up and down. Furthermore, the <b>wear</b> <b>patterns</b> were parallel, revealing that the rows of teeth were extremely well aligned in the jaw.|$|E
40|$|Interproximal {{grooving}} of {{the teeth}} {{is a form}} of nonmasticatory wear commonly found in precontemporary human populations. While its cause is debated, it is thought to be due to the repeated abrasion of fibrous materials across the distal surfaces of teeth during processing. This report describes the presence of interproximal grooves on the distal surfaces of the lower second molars of the WLH 4 individual from the Willandra Lakes in New South Wales, Australia. Although there has been considerable discussion regarding the distinct occlusal <b>wear</b> <b>pattern</b> in WLH 3, this is the first recorded instance of an interproximal <b>wear</b> <b>pattern</b> in the Willandra Lakes region, and has implications for our understanding of cultural behaviors practiced by those populations in the late Holocene.

40|$|Captive giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) mostly do not {{attain the}} {{longevity}} possible for this species and frequently have {{problems associated with}} low energy intake and fat storage mobilization. Abnormal tooth wear {{has been among the}} causes suggested as an underlying problem. This study utilizes a tooth wear scoring method ("mesowear") primarily used in paleobiology. This scoring method was applied to museum specimens of free-ranging (n = 20) and captive (n = 41) giraffes. The scoring system allows for the differentiation between attrition- (typical for browsers, as browse contains little abrasive silica) and abrasion- (typical for grazers, as grass contains abrasive silica) dominated tooth wear. The dental <b>wear</b> <b>pattern</b> of the free-ranging population is dominated by attrition, resembles that previously published for free-ranging giraffe, and clusters within browsing herbivores in comparative analysis. In contrast, the <b>wear</b> <b>pattern</b> of the captive population is dominated by abrasion and clusters among grazing herbivores in comparative analyses. A potential explanation for this difference in tooth wear is likely related to the content of abrasive elements in zoo diets. Silica content (measured as acid insoluble ash) is low in browse and alfalfa. However, grass hay and the majority of pelleted compound feeds contain higher amounts of silica. It can be speculated that the abnormal <b>wear</b> <b>pattern</b> in captivity compromises tooth function in captive giraffe, with deleterious long-term consequences...|$|R

40|$|Abradable {{seal rubber}} {{has been widely}} used in aero-engine fans to improve their {{efficiency}} by reducing the clearance between rotating and stationary components. To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of seal rubber, abrasion tests were conducted at a blade tip velocity of 50 â€“ 300 Â m/s with an incursion rate of 100 Â Î¼m/s. The influences of the blade tip velocity on the wear mechanism and interaction forces were specially analyzed. It is shown that abrasive <b>wear</b> and <b>pattern</b> <b>wear</b> are the predominant <b>wear</b> mechanisms, and <b>pattern</b> <b>wear</b> {{can be seen as}} the emergence and propagation of cracks. With an increase of the blade tip velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of seal rubber exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of <b>pattern</b> <b>wear.</b> At a constant incursion rate of 100 Â Î¼m/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the blade tip velocity, and the blade tip velocity of 150 Â m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive <b>wear</b> and <b>pattern</b> <b>wear...</b>|$|R
