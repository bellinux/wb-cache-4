2500|$|PC-552 began {{rounding}} up task force at 0222B and was underway by 0320B. Task force rendezvoused with main assault group at 0930B. Weather was very rough and several ships had trouble keeping station. USS LCT (A) 2043 reported its engine room flooding {{and was in}} serious difficulty. PC-552 passed over her only emergency portable pump and the ship was able to continue. At 2225B, ship received an S.O.S from the USS LCT (A) 2229. Ship was taking on moderate seas {{and was unable to}} jettison its cargo of tanks. PC-552 took on the Army personnel and the ship was able to survive by leaving station. The convoy proceeded on. According to Ted Guzda, [...] "We turned back to Southampton...stayed till 2 or so and heard that the invasion was on, <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> back out. We practically led the whole convoy across the Channel. The Augusta was the headquarters of the whole invasion. It was a heavy cruiser. We came alongside and they told us good luck, you’re on your own." ...|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, {{instead of}} {{continuing}} to aim for Aylesbury, <b>we</b> <b>headed</b> by cross-roads for some point to the northward of it, whither I might assist Rowley with the baggage, and where I might leave him to await my return in the post-chaise.|$|E

Thus, growth theory is by its very nature deeply political. ...|$|R
