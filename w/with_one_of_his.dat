5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over {{a proposed}} landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin {{felt that this}} would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E

5|$|In 858, Bardas deposed patriarch Ignatios and {{appointed}} Photios, well-educated but a layman, in his stead. Later chronicles report that Ignatios had excluded Bardas from communion because he maintained an incestuous relationship <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughters-in-law, {{but the real}} reason for Ignatios's deposition was probably the patriarch's staunch refusal to tonsure Empress Theodora against her will, as demanded by Bardas. The irregular elevation of Photios, however, riled with Pope Nicholas I, who refused to recognize it. Coupled with competition between Rome and Constantinople over their missionary activities in and jurisdiction over Moravia and Bulgaria, relations with the papacy remained tense.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual.

5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue {{for the creation of}} new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E

5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> leading ladies {{and walked out of the}} family home.|$|E

In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims' kidneys.|$|E
