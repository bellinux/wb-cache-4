50|$|John sees {{people being}} chased and {{attacked}} by demon, and then sees them coming for him. He, {{depending on the}} player's choice, uses his gun, {{the first part of}} the Witch's Curse set, to slay these demons. He then starts searching around Hell for the first piece of the Holy Shotgun, while seeing the horrors of Hell with his own eyes. As he searches, more souls are attacked and more demons are seen fighting against John. At a dead end, he finds the second gun for the Witch's Curse set, but is grabbed by a bird-like demon and flown through the skies of Hell. He is dropped and then is ambushed by a hoard of demons - just in front of the holding stall of the Holy Shotgun piece. He then uses the <b>water</b> <b>ampoule</b> he was carrying and gets out of Hell.|$|E
5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. It is {{relatively}} unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C.

30|$|The {{study was}} a double-blinded {{placebo-controlled}} randomized trial approved by the Carmel Medical Center Helsinki Ethics Committee. We included 40 patients (20 patients in each arm), ages 18 – 70, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grade I or II, undergoing elective gynecological laparoscopic surgery at our Ambulatory Gynecoendoscopic Unit. All operations were performed by two senior consultants. After signing a consent form, patients who were candidates for a same-day outpatient laparoscopy including unilateral/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or unilateral/bilateral ovarian cystectomy randomly received either 10  ml of 1  % ropivacaine {{to a total of}} 100  mg (Naropin, 100  mg/ 10  ml, AstraZeneca, UK) or 10  ml of sterile <b>water.</b> The <b>ampoules</b> were prepared according to a double-blind design with the contents of the ampoules known only to the hospital pharmacy. Patients were randomly assigned to the study and control groups by a computer-generated algorithm.|$|R
50|$|The greenish-brown NpO2 is {{very stable}} {{over a large}} range of {{pressures}} and temperatures and does not undergo phase transitions at low temperatures. It does show a phase transition from face-centered cubic to orthorhombic at around 33-37GPa, although it returns to is original phase when pressure is released. It remains stable under oxygen pressures up to 2.84 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Np2O5 is black-brown in color and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409 picometres.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{vertical}} Bridgman-Stockbarger apparatus {{was used}} to directionally solidify water upward, {{in the hope that}} detached solidification would evolve from gas bubbles forming on the wall. A large contact angle of the <b>water</b> on the <b>ampoule</b> wall and a high solubility of the dissolved gas caused gas bubbles or tubes to form only at the ampoule wall, and not in the interior. Gas tubes were often nearly periodically spaced around the ampoule wall, with a spacing that increased with ampoule diameter and decreased with freezing rate. The width of the gas tubes was nearly independent of the ampoule diameter and freezing rate. A high degree of detachment was obtained with a rough, nonwetting coating on the ampoule wall, but full detachment was not achieved. This indicates that detachment does not occur by propagation of a single gas bubble around the periphery of the freezing interface. The convection near the freezing interface influenced gas bubble formation, and was outward for a concave freezing interface and inward for a convex interface...|$|R
40|$|Steady-state {{detached}} solidification {{of water}} was calculated using the Moving Meniscus Model. Similar {{to the experimental}} observation of many materials in microgravity, detached solidification of water is predicted to occur in a sealed ampoule at zero gravity under proper conditions. For steady detachment, the freezing rate must exceed a critical value, Henry’s constant of the dissolved gas must be below a critical value, {{the temperature of the}} top of the water must be below a critical value, the contact angle of <b>water</b> on the <b>ampoule</b> wall must exceed a critical value, and the diffusion coefficient must exceed a critical value. Each critical value depends on the physical properties and the other operating conditions. Thus different results are obtained for InSb and water. The critical gas pressure above the melt for water is much smaller than for InSb, the critical freezing rate is larger for water, and the critical contact angle of the melt on the ampoule wall is larger for water. For the gases examined here, the solubilities of Ar, N 2 and Ne in water are sufficien...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission Joint Research Centre in Geel (JRC-Geel) is on {{a regular}} basis {{preparing}} radioactive sources. These sources can be used as calibration standards or reference sources in different applications, e. g. proficiency testing of laboratories monitoring radioactivity in the environment organized by JRC-Geel. In order to automate the sample preparation process a precision pattern dispenser was designed to reproducibly dispense radioactive solutions. The set-up should be able to dispense pre-set amounts of stock solution in an automated and reproducible way in predefined positions or patterns. Correct dispensing should be ensured by defining the positions of ampoules or special source holders precisely. The set-up must also be able to dispense pre-set amount of liquid according to designed patterns on air filters having a maximum size of 60 x 60 cm. During all manipulations no evaporation of stock solution can be afforded in order not to compromise its concentration. The liquids to be handled are mainly acidic solutions so all parts must be resistant to the acidic environment. The number of instrument parts that come in contact with the radioactive solution must be kept to a minimum to limit the amount of radioactive waste and should be easily replaceable. The precision pattern dispenser is composed of a commercially available sample handling unit that makes use of syringes to handle the liquid. This unit is coupled to an XYZ-table where e. g. air filters can be fixed on. A custom-made interface (protocol generator software) is used to design dispensing patterns on filters of different sizes and shapes. The combination of the filter and the pattern, called protocol, is sent to the software steering the sampling unit and the XYZ-table. The mass or volume to be dispensed and the position where it has to be dispensed is easily introducible and made visible in the protocol generator. Qualification tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the instrument and to assess the compliance with the requirements. The two most important parameters to be tested were trueness and precision. The maximum values according to the specifications were 2 % for trueness and 1 % for precision. Tests were performed by dispensing <b>water</b> into glass <b>ampoules.</b> All other parameters described above were examined and found to be compliant with the specifications. The results of the tests demonstrate that the precision pattern dispenser can dispense liquid within the required specifications. The instrument can be used to spike air filters with an almost homogenous distribution of activity within a predefined area. The precision pattern dispenser makes it possible to prepare sources for different applications in a fast and accurate way. JRC. G. 2 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguar...|$|R
