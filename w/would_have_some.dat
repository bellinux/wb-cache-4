5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{was also}} {{to receive the}} Aouzou strip {{which was to be}} moved from French-ruled Chad to Italian-ruled Libya (this issue <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{implications}} in World War II and in post-colonial Libya-Chad relations).|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} extension <b>would</b> <b>have</b> reused <b>some</b> of {{the former}} railway alignment. However {{some of it was}} built on or filled in after closure, making re-opening more difficult, so the proposed line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> included <b>some</b> new infrastructure and street running sections to take it into Stockport. In these plans, the line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> terminated at Stockport bus station.|$|R

50|$|In reality, the USSR was (like other naval powers) {{retiring}} and/or scrapping {{its existing}} battleships, which had seemingly been rendered useless by the aircraft carrier. The United States Navy considered creating a missile battleship {{out of the}} unfinished USS Kentucky, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> similarities to the fictional K-1000 class; however, this plan never went ahead.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, BMG {{created a}} minor scandal in 2001 when it {{released}} Natalie Imbruglia's second album, White Lilies Island, without warning labels {{stating that the}} CD had copy protection. The CDs were eventually replaced. BMG and Sony both released copy-protected versions of certain releases in certain markets in late 2001, and a late 2002 report indicated that all BMG CDs sold in Europe <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> form of copy protection.|$|E
25|$|With the Rugby World Cup in September, {{all three}} {{countries}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of their top players rested, to avoid injuries. All Blacks coach Graham Henry made clear his wish {{for up to}} 30 of New Zealand's best players to miss around half of the Super 14, with the five New Zealand franchises supporting him in May 2006. The mandatory stand-down period meant that the 30 players who toured {{at the end of}} 2006 would miss at least the first week of competition.|$|E
25|$|In May, Vivendi {{announced}} the game's release {{had been pushed}} back to 2006. In the same statement, they revealed the game was being developed for the Xbox 360 {{as well as the}} PS2, Xbox and PC. The Xbox version of the game was first made available in playable form (albeit not playable by the public) at E3 2005 in May. Radical stated the PC and PlayStation 2 versions would be identical to the Xbox version, although the Xbox 360 version <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> unique features.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1981, Pacheco {{took a job}} as a {{volunteer}} inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, so that he and Newkirk <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> firsthand knowledge on which to base their campaigns. Edward Taub, a psychologist, was working there on 17 monkeys. He had cut sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to their arms and legs, then used physical restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food to force them to use the limbs. The idea was to see whether monkeys could be induced to use limbs they could not feel.|$|E
25|$|Specific Ottoman {{interest}} in Habeshistan arose from its pivotal geographic {{position in the}} region: it had ports and coastline on both the Red Sea (and near the Bab-el-Mandeb, where Ottoman blockades could be performed if necessary) and on the Indian Ocean (specifically Zeila and the Somali coast). The Ottoman navy was still relatively weak and in its infancy, so Ottoman land forces would have to capture key areas {{to ensure that the}} weak navy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> influence and strengthen. Selman also recognized a religious duty to conquer Habesh.|$|E
25|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1966, Milošević {{became an}} economic advisor to Mayor of Belgrade Branko Pešić. Five years later, he married his childhood friend, Mirjana Marković, {{with whom he}} had two children: Marko and Marija. Marković <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> influence on Milošević's political career both before and after his rise to power; she was also leader of her husband's junior coalition partner, Yugoslav Left (JUL) in the 1990s. In 1968, Milošević got a job at the Tehnogas company, where Stambolić was working, and became its chairman in 1973. By 1978, Stambolić's sponsorship had enabled Milošević to become the head of Beobanka, one of Yugoslavia's largest banks; his frequent trips to Paris and New York gave him the opportunity to learn English. He was 6 feet 1¼ inches (186cm) tall.|$|E

60|$|Instead of {{a pitcher}} of ale on his supper-table, the good knight <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> tea or coffee; and instead of a chine of beef, a mess of pottage, and a great loaf of brown bread for his evening meal, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> white bread, cakes, preserves, and other trifles of that sort, which in the olden days were {{considered}} only fit for children and women. The good old English gentlemen were tremendous eaters. They used to take five meals a day, and {{each one of them}} was heavy and substantial.|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} 19th-century theatres, the Brooklyn Theatre's stage was a {{presentation}} platform, a prop factory and a warehouse. At {{the back of}} the stage was the painter's bridge, a walkway which ran the width of the stage and which could be raised or lowered as required for painting backdrops, or drops. These and borders, scenic elements painted on canvas and mounted on wooden frames, were installed in a rigging loft,known as a Fly System, a large wooden open frame equipped with the pulleys and tackle needed to raise or lower scenic elements. It was suspended high in the fly space or , the volume above the stage never seen by the audience. For a large production with many scene changes, the rigging loft could be heavily loaded with painted canvas. On the night of the fire, it contained drops and borders for The Two Orphans. and the scenery for Julius Caesar was stacked on the stage, awaiting pickup. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> bearing on the fire's outset, when stage manager Thorpe considered getting the hose, but was hampered by scenery.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Zemeckis {{directed}} the black comedy Death Becomes Her, starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. Although his next film <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements, {{and was also}} his biggest commercial success to date, Forrest Gump (1994). Starring Tom Hanks in the title role, and borrowing to some extent from Woody Allen's earlier Zelig, Forrest Gump {{tells the story of}} a man with a low I.Q., who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top grossing U.S. film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hanks) and Best Director (for Zemeckis). In 1997, Zemeckis directed Contact, a long-gestating project based on Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway, a scientist played by Jodie Foster, who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrial beings.|$|E
25|$|Native Mexican {{appreciation}} {{of their own}} crafts would be helped near the mid century, {{in part because of}} the popularity of films by Emilio “El Indio” Fernández and Gabriel Figueroa. Eventually, even homes in the exclusive Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood of Mexico City <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> touch of “lo mexicano” (Mexican-ness) in their décor. At the end of the 1940, governor of the State of Mexico Isidro Fabela created the first museum dedicated to Mexican folk arts and crafts in Toluca. Later Mexican president Miguel Alemán Valdés inaugurated the National Museum of Popular Arts and Industries, naming Fernando Gamboa as curator. Gamboa organized an exposition in Europe with great success. Adolfo López Mateos created a trust to promote Mexican arts and crafts called the Banco Nacional de Fomento Cooperativo which was transformed into the current Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de la Artesanías (FONART) by Luis Echeverría. Various states organized similar support structures, including Casas de Artesanías which are state-run store selling handcrafted merchandise. A private initiative by Banamex supports a large number of artists and arranges expositions where some of the best crafts to be found can be seen and bought.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{with the}} arrival of PT-35, all of MacArthur's group had reached Mindanao safely, but there were no {{aircraft}} at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked [...] {{in the hope that the}} general <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was disturbing to the party, as the Japanese were only [...] away, at Davao on the south coast of Mindanao.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E

500|$|According to Angelou, the book's title {{came from}} the rent parties of the 1920s and 1930s, where people would pay the host an {{inexpensive}} entry fee and then eat and drink throughout the weekend. As Angelou stated, people would [...] "sing and swing and get merry like Christmas so one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fuel with which to live {{the rest of the}} week". These parties, also called [...] "parlor socials", were attended by members of the working class who were unable to afford to go to Harlem's more expensive clubs. As critic Mary Jane Lupton stated, [...] "The concept of the rent party helps describe Angelou's position...She is a single mother from the South who goes to California and sings and swings for a living. She entertains others for little money as a singer, B-girl, and dancer, without getting very merry at all". Scholar Sondra O'Neale described the phrase as [...] "a folkloric title symbolic of the author's long-deserved ascent to success and fulfillment".|$|E
500|$|The British {{followed}} in rapid pursuit. [...] As they advanced, the British light troops signalled with bugle calls, which to Colonel Joseph Reed were {{reminiscent of a}} fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult. [...] Probably about this time, the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had met Knowlton, rode to Washington {{to tell him what}} was going on and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Instead of retreating, Washington, in what Edward G. Lengel calls [...] "an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on", [...] devised a plan to entrap the British light troops. Washington <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> troops make a feint, in order to draw the British down into an area of open ground known as 'The Hollow Way', and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
