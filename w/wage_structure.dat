25|$|McCarron {{was elected}} secretary-treasurer of the Southern California Council of Carpenters in 1987. He quickly reorganized the union, a move {{which became a}} {{hallmark}} of his later career as international union president. At the time, the Southern California carpenters' union had hundreds of mostly autonomous local unions which managed their own affairs (some well, some not), set their own work rules, competed with one another for jobs, and ran their own hiring halls. The district council had little power. Employers, however, {{wanted to work with}} just the district council, one set of rules and one <b>wage</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

The introduction of a Miner's Charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day <b>wage</b> <b>structure,</b> and in 1948 a Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme was approved, providing supplementary allowances to disabled coal-workers and their dependants. In 1948, a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new NHS, as well as their dependents. Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation (Superannuation) Regulations of 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established. Improvements were also made in farmworkers' wages, and the Agricultural Wages Board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, Bieber {{was once}} more {{negotiating}} {{a contract with}} GM, but his control of the collective bargaining process was {{not as strong as}} in the past. A local struck the GM plant in Flint, Michigan, on August 8, 1990, about a month before the national contract with the company ended. Bieber {{had little to do with}} the strike, which was approved by GM Department Director Stephen Yokich (by now considered Bieber's most likely successor). The Flint strike complicated Bieber's attempts to negotiate a new national contract, and Yokich's approval of the local strike indicated Bieber's weakening control over the union. The Flint strike ended on August 15, but it had generated UAW member unrest with Bieber's leadership of the union. Bieber did not need a contract extension this time, and negotiated a contract identical in <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> to the 1987 agreement. A Ford contract followed in early October 1990, and a Chrysler contract 20 days later, both of which were very similar to the GM agreement.|$|E

This paper examines {{the extent to which}} <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> have adjusted to remove such distortions during the economic transition using micro-data from the Czech Republic. There is strong evidence that Czech <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> are moving toward patterns in market economies, and the change is led by developments in the private sector and retarded by the sluggish response in state enterprises. At the same time, the establishment of collective bargaining {{does not appear to be}} introducing countervailing distortions into Czech <b>wage</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R

Meredith had previously been involved with the Association Footballers' Union (the [...] "AFU"), the first attempt by football players in England to organise a trade union. The Players' Union, like the AFU before it, sought the relaxation of restrictions on transfers and wages. Others made the argument that a free market <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> would ruin the amateur principles the sport was founded on, but Meredith felt that these words rang hollow considering that club directors and shareholders made vast profits. At the first annual meeting in December 1908, the PU stated their aims as to allow unlimited wages, the right to transfer from club to club, and for players to take a percentage of any transfer fee.|$|E

[...] By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated {{by most of the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc (along with China, Mongolia and North Korea), with heavy restrictions preventing such emigration. [...] A Hungarian economist stated that [...] "it was quite obvious that the socialist countries—like other countries—intended to prevent their professionals, trained at the expense of their society, from being used to enrich other countries." [...] Eastern European spokesmen maintained that they were keeping would-be emigrants from suffering from insufficient linguistic and cultural preparation. [...] They also stressed the debt that individuals owed to socialist states, which offered care from birth, including subsidized education and training and, thus, they justified the emigration restrictions as an [...] "education tax" [...] with the states having a right to recoup its investment. [...] Open emigration policies would create a [...] "brain drain", forcing the state to readjust its <b>wage</b> <b>structure</b> at a cost to other economic priorities. Bulgarian and Romanian representatives had long argued that they could not afford to match western salaries and, without emigration restrictions, they [...] "would become like Africa." [...] The restrictions presented a quandary for some Eastern Bloc states that had been more economically advanced and open than the Soviet Union, such that crossing borders seemed more natural—especially between East and West Germany where no prior border existed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> of professional workers in the Israeli labor market, using data from the most recent 1995 Census and correcting for selectivity at the stage of entrance into the occupation. The sample of professionals is decomposed into several subsamples: men and women and within each gender a distinction is made between Easterners (origination from Asian/African countries) and Westerners (from European/American countries of origin). Comparisons by gender and ethnicity can then be made. Characteristics (endowments) and <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> of the four groups are presented. Wage equations include the Inverse of Mill's Ratio as a regressor to correct for selection into the professional occupations. Wage differences are then examined and decomposed into 3 components: Endowments (human capital), discrimination and selectivity.

The wage gap between the typical public sector worker and a comparable private sector worker was relatively constant for men during this period, but declined substantially for women. Equally important, wage dispersion in the public sector was increasing relative to wage dispersion in the private sector prior to 1970, at the time when public sector employment was rising rapidly. Since 1970, however, there has been a significant relative compression of the wage distribution in the public sector. The different evolutions of the <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> in the two sectors are an important determinant of the sorting of workers across sectors.

The rise in {{inequality}} {{between the}} 1970 s and the 1990 s and the per-sistent gap in pay between {{large and small}} employers {{are two of the}} most robust findings in the study of labor markets. Mainstream economists focus on differences in observable and unobservable skills to explain both the overall rising inequality and the size–wage gap. In this paper we model how increasing returns to skill can affect the size–wage gap both with constant sorting and with size-biased, skill-biased technological change (e. g. if large firms always had access to computers, but small firms gained access to computers with the rise of affordable personal computers). We analyze the Current Population Surveys from 1979 to 1993 to determine whether large and small employers are converging in terms of mean wages (the employer size–wage effect), <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> by occupation and education, charac-teristics of employees, and <b>wage</b> <b>structures</b> by region.
