50|$|Alaska {{also has}} a history of {{supporting}} third party candidates at the presidential level. Alaska was the second-best state for Ross Perot in the 1992 election, <b>with</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> garnering 28% of the vote. Alaska was Nader's strongest state in the 2000 presidential election, giving him 10% in his presidential bid. Alaska was also the third-best state for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson in the 2012 election, giving him 2.46% of the vote, behind Johnson's home state of New Mexico, and Montana. For this reason, Alaska has been considered to be one of Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson's strongest states in the 2016 election.|$|E
5000|$|Clinton's nearly 10-point {{victory in}} New Hampshire {{was much more}} convincing than his {{previous}} win {{in the state in}} 1992; that year he had only eked out a narrow plurality of 39% over George H.W. Bush's 38%, <b>with</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> taking nearly 23% of the vote. For a state that had voted over 60% Republican as recently as the 1980s, Clinton's victories represented a dramatic shift toward the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. Since then the state has voted Democratic in every presidential election, except in 2000, when George W. Bush eked out a narrow plurality win over Al Gore.|$|E
50|$|Kansas was won by {{incumbent}} President George H.W. Bush (R-Texas) with 38.88% of {{the popular}} vote over Governor Bill Clinton (D-Arkansas) <b>with</b> 33.74%. Businessman <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> (I-Texas) finished in third with 26.99% {{of the popular}} vote. Kansas was surprisingly close, likely because <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> split the vote.

Pat Buchanan's opening night [...] "Culture War" [...] speech argued that a great battle of values was taking place in the United States. Republican National Committee chairman Rich Bond (referring to Democrats) claimed that [...] "we are America, they are not America". Marilyn Quayle dismissed Bill Clinton's claim to a new generation of leadership by saying, [...] "Not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft." [...] Regarding Buchanan's speech, liberal humorist Molly Ivins quipped that it [...] "probably sounded better in the original German." [...] Writing twenty years after the convention, the New York Times wrote, [...] "Supporters of Mr. Bush pointed to the tone of the convention as {{one of the reasons he}} lost re-election that November to Bill Clinton.", as it centered more on Reagan-era values and Bush's international credentials at a time that the main issue was the domestic crisis. The fact that the now-infamous [...] "No new taxes" [...] pledge had haunted the President for the last three years, the economy was barely mentioned.|$|E

However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under President Clinton. A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however.

One of these outlets {{was built in the}} Nashville area and several in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. He remained friends with many prominent persons, however, including former heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali and became friends <b>with</b> H. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot.</b> Hooker always claimed to have been the first and primary counselor in Perot's decision to run for President of the United States in 1992.|$|R

Johnson in 1964. It is also the last time that the state voted Democratic as of 2016. Considered a safe Republican state, Clinton's win was due to independent <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> splitting the Republican vote and allowing the Democrats to win the state for the first time since 1964.|$|R

50|$|Curry County, {{like most}} of southwestern Oregon, is a solidly Republican county, {{although}} it does not give so small a proportion of its vote to Democrats as Eastern Oregon. No Democratic presidential candidate has obtained an absolute majority in Curry County since Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 landslide, and the county has been carried by a Democrat for President only once since the “Reagan Revolution”. This occurred when Bill Clinton obtained a 32-vote plurality over George Bush senior in a three-way contest <b>with</b> billionaire businessman <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> in 1992.|$|R

As the first workstation to include a DSP and high-capacity optical disc drive, NeXT hardware was advanced for its time, but was expensive relative to the rapidly commoditizing workstation market and marred by design problems. The hardware was phased out in 1993; however, the company's object-oriented operating system NeXTSTEP had a more lasting legacy.|$|R
50|$|Arkansas was {{won by the}} state's Governor Bill Clinton (D) with 53.21% of {{the popular}} vote over {{incumbent}} President George H.W. Bush (R-Texas) <b>with</b> 35.48%.

Clinton was Governor of Arkansas at the time, and as he was popular within the state, he easily won by a margin of 17.73%, making it the first time that Arkansas had voted Democratic since 1976 when it voted for Jimmy Carter.

It has only voted Republican twice since its statehood (1972 for Richard Nixon, and 1984 for Ronald Reagan). These Republican wins were landslides for Presidents Nixon and Reagan who both carried 49 out of 50 states. Hawaii has remained reliably Democratic since.|$|R

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Reagan {{administration}} {{significant change}} occurred within the conservative movement during the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton Administrations. In 1992, many conservatives repudiated President George H. W. Bush because campaigned {{to the center of the}} American political spectrum, and Bill Clinton campaigned to the right of the center. He was defeated for reelection in 1992 in a three way race, <b>with</b> populist <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> attracting considerable support on the right. Democrat Bill Clinton was stopped in his plan for government health care. In 1994 the GOP made sweeping gains under the leadership of Newt Gingrich, the first Republican to become Speaker in 40 years. Gingrich overplayed his hand by cutting off funding for the Federal government, allowing Clinton to regain momentum and win reelection in 1996. The [...] "Contract with America" [...] promised numerous reforms, but little was accomplished beyond the ending of major New Deal welfare programs. A national movement to impose term limits failed to reach Congress (because the Supreme Court ruled that a constitutional amendment was needed) but did transform politics in some states, especially California.
