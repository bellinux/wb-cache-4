5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
500|$|An {{agreement}} {{signed by}} Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937, allowed the conductor to [...] "select and employ a complete symphony orchestra" [...] for the recording. Disney hired a {{stage at the}} Culver Studios in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians. As production costs of The Sorcerer's Apprentice climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, [...] "because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> can be expected from such a production." [...] Ben Sharpsteen, a production supervisor on Fantasia, noted that its budget was {{three to four times}} greater than the usual Silly Symphony, but Disney [...] "saw this trouble {{in the form of an}} opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers—regardless of their running time—put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert—something novel and of high quality." ...|$|E

"As {{long as he}} is {{stationary}} {{there it}} is likely enough {{that the bulk of}} Joubert's army will cling to Natal, knowing well enough that before we shall be in a condition to move forward they can entrench their positions on the Biggarsberg and the Drakenberg until they are quite as formidable as those we have been knocking our heads against. I should not be at all surprised if it is a couple of months before Roberts {{is in a position to}} advance. Of course at present <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the plans are, but likely enough at least half the force here may be sent down to Durban, and then by water to East London, and from there to Bloemfontein by rail. It would be ridiculous for us to renew the sort of fighting we have been doing when the enemy are sure to clear out when Roberts crosses the Vaal, and Natal be thus freed without any further loss of life. Possibly the troops may not be sent round by sea, but will remain here until Roberts gets as far as Kroonstadt. Then, no doubt, a division will be sent down through Bethlehem to Harrismith, and so open Van Reenen's Pass, in which case the troops from here can go up by train to Bethlehem. At any rate, I am afraid that most of us will remain here for at least two months.|$|E

Sound maps also have a historical significance in that they will give future generations an idea ofwhat a specific place sounded like, at a specific time. Indeed, as the Montreal Sound Map project pointed out: sound maps can be used as “sonic time capsules” which preserve the sounds of a place before they disappear. Currently, we possess historical maps and pictures that can tell us how past societies lived. However, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> those societies sounded like.

The track contains a sample of [...] "The Gasser" [...] by Lord Buckley, from his 1960 album [...] "Best of Buckley", the sample itself is a hipsemantic rant about 15th Century Spanish Explorer, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, whom {{was a part of}} the Narváez expedition. The song opens with Buckley's lines of [...] "They didn't know where they was going, but they knew where they was, wasn't it" [...] The sample is used to question the position of humans in modern-day Earth.
