5|$|People <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{large cities}} {{have a higher}} rate of COPD {{compared}} to people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations, its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{citizens}} <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> areas corresponding to classes 1–3 than those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the areas corresponding to classes 5 and 6.

5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> oppressive regimes {{are forced to}} make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: {{to have a life}} of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements.
