500|$|Xbox One X is {{compatible}} with all existing Xbox One software and accessories. Games marketed as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware, while separate iconography {{is being used to}} denote games that natively run at 4K resolution, or support HDR. Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do." [...] Spencer also touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also be used to support virtual reality, noting that especially at a console price point, [...] "having something at six teraflops that will get millions of people buying it is very attractive to some of the VR companies that are out there already, and we've architected it such that something will be able to plug right in and work." [...] However, Microsoft has not yet announced any official plans for VR support on Xbox One X, stating that it wished to prioritize wireless VR efforts on console, and Windows Mixed Reality on PC.|$|E

60|$|The Professor {{had been}} reading up Malvina. It flashed across him that this had always been her speciality: Changing people. How had the Arlington twins {{discovered}} it?

60|$|She {{stopped for}} an almost {{imperceptible}} moment {{to give him}} an indignant glance, and then moved on. That feminine penetration--so clever and so tainted by the eternal instinct of self-defence, so ready to see an obvious evil in everything it cannot understand--filled her with bitter resentment against both the men who could offer to the spiritual and tragic strife of her feelings nothing but the coarseness of their abominable materialism. In her anger against her own ineffectual self-deception she found hate enough for them both. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>want?</b> <b>What</b> more <b>did</b> this one want?

Giovanni, the eldest child, was a tall lad of sixteen, with soft brown hair and grey eyes, and a clarity of brow, and the same calm simplicity of bearing which made Paolo so complete; but the son had {{at the same time a}} certain brownness of skin, a heaviness of blood, which he had from his mother.
