5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a <b>warning</b> <b>message</b> attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

He closed {{watertight}} doors, posted double lookouts, ordered a black-out, and had the lifeboats swung out on their davits so that they could be launched quickly if necessary. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first class lounge.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of disaster early <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> {{has a significant}} role in the effectiveness and serviceability in an Early Warning System (EWS). Providing the community in a disaster area with an adequate dissemination and communication of early <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> will improve people's awareness and reaction to a natural hazard. People who live in a disaster area play a crucial role in the success of EWS. Malaysian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian authorities employ mobile phone applications, such as text messages (SMS), as a tool for disaster <b>warning</b> <b>messages.</b> However, there are many challenges in methods for disseminating early <b>warning</b> <b>messages.</b> One of the challenges is the dissemination method in which only notification messages are sent. In this paper, we propose confirmation or verification messages, as part of disaster early <b>warning</b> <b>messages,</b> by using text messages. Confirmation messages are messages that use a verification channel to provide up-to- date official information about the latest natural disaster conditions.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the self-reported awareness {{of the presence of}} product <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> and signs among random samples of Hispanics in San Francisco surveyed in 1990 and in 1991. The messages that were tested related to cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and other consumer products. A random sample of 1, 204 Hispanics (43. 5 percent males) were interviewed by telephone in 1990. The corresponding figure for the second survey in 1991 was 1, 569 Hispanics (41. 1 percent males). In general, respondents reported low levels of awareness of the presence of product <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> and signs. The exception was <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> on cigarette packets which approximately 70 percent of the respondents reported having seen within the 12 months before the survey. There was an increase from 1990 to 1991 in the reported awareness of <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> for wine, beer, and cigarettes. Smokers and drinkers of alcoholic beverages reported the highest levels of awareness of the relevant <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> and signs. Length of exposure to <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> and multiplicity of sources (for example, advertisements and products) seem to produce greater levels of awareness of the presence of product <b>warning</b> <b>messages.</b> Less acculturated, Spanish-speaking Hispanics are less likely to report being aware of the warnings, particularly those that appear only in English (for example, alcoholic beverages) ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} a multi-hop broadcast protocol to efficiently disseminate emergency <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> in a VANET. To address the broadcast storm problem, we {{have adopted the}} approach of road segment division and selected the segment leaders {{who are responsible for}} relaying the <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> over multiple hops to further nodes. To reduce the mutual interference with the existing periodic safety messages, we have proposed a time-slotted structure for the multi-hop transmissions. Specifically, we have assigned separate time slots for the <b>warning</b> <b>messages</b> and proposed the use of a black burst signal and a CLEAR packet before the actual data transmission to eliminate all the hidden nodes in range and reserve the multi-hop time slot. To avoid the unnecessary retransmissions of the <b>warning</b> <b>messages,</b> we have established a mechanism that effectively handles the case of ACK packet losses. Simulation results with realistic parameters have verified the clear advantages of our proposed scheme over existing solutions in several key performance criteria.|$|R

At 6.45 a coastguard helicopter began a coastal search between Fowey and Falmouth, covering a distance of five miles out to sea. It was joined at 9.45 by a Shackleton aircraft supplied by the RAF Search and Rescue Force, which extended the search area further south, west and east. Later, two Royal Navy ships, HMS Fearless and HMS Ark Royal participated in the sea search.

2500|$|The Japanese code dubbed [...] "Purple", {{which was}} used by the Foreign Office and only for {{diplomatic}} (but not for military) messages, was broken by Army cryptographers in 1940. A 14-part message using this code, sent from Japan to its embassy in Washington, was decoded in Washington on 6 and 7 December. The message, which made plain the Japanese intention to break off diplomatic relations with the United States, was to be delivered by the Japanese ambassador at 1 p.m. Washington time (dawn in the Pacific). Colonel Rufus S. Bratton, then serving as an aide to Marshall, took this to mean that the Japanese intended to attack at dawn somewhere in the Pacific. Marshall ordered a <b>warning</b> <b>message</b> sent to American bases in the area, including Hawaii. Due to atmospheric transmission conditions the message was sent out via Western Union rather than the usual signal channels and was not received until the attack was already underway.|$|E
