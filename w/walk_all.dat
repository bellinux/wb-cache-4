In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.|$|E
25|$|Martínez's {{record was}} 18–6, but {{could have been}} even better. In his six losses, Martínez had 60 strikeouts, 8 walks, and 30 hits allowed in 48 innings, with a 2.44 ERA and an 0.79 WHIP, while {{averaging}} 8 innings per start. Martínez's ERA in his losing games was less than the leading ERA total in the lower-scoring National League (Kevin Brown's 2.58). The Yankees' Andy Pettitte outdueled Martínez twice; Martínez's other four losses were each by one run. Martínez's first loss {{of the year was}} a 1–0 complete game in which he had 17 strikeouts and 1 <b>walk.</b> <b>All</b> of Martínez's losses were quality starts, and he pitched 8 or more innings in all but one of his losses. Martínez received 2 runs or fewer of run support in 10 of his starts (over one third of his starts), in which his ERA was a minuscule 1.25 with 4 complete games and 2 shutouts, but his win-loss record was 4–5.|$|E
500|$|The 1946 season saw Grove persist as {{a stable}} {{part of the}} White Sox {{pitching}} rotation. He pitched in 33 games during the season, second to closer Earl Caldwell, and started in 26, second to Ed Lopat's 29. His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the Washington Senators. Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters, allowing three hits and a <b>walk,</b> <b>all</b> of which were negated by double plays. He finished the season with more losses than wins because {{he was eager to}} succeed and was trying too hard, and because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into [...] "as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time". At the end of the 1946 season, Grove had eight wins and 13 losses, a 3.02 ERA, 10 complete games, and a league-leading 10 wild pitches.|$|E

2500|$|The character's {{demeanour}} altered somewhat circa 2000. Due to her romantic pairing with Phil Mitchell, {{she became}} [...] "mentally battered". Rupert Smith, author of EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square, classified the character as an [...] "eternal victim": one who endures misfortune and misery, an endless sufferer. He adds, [...] "She was intelligent, beautiful and young— and so, of course, Lisa {{had to lie}} [...] down and let men <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> over her [...] a snivelling, suicidal wreck." [...] Benjamin has noted that her character was [...] "constantly crying".|$|E
2500|$|After {{only three}} seasons, Rudometkin {{was forced to}} prematurely retire from basketball. His stamina {{weakened}} noticeably and doctors could not initially determine the cause. [...] He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, {{a diverse group of}} blood cancers that include any kind of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphoma. He spent years in treatment, which caused total hair loss, temporary paralysis and the need to learn to <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> over again. Rudometkin eventually went into remission and cites both medicine and his faith as reasons why he was able to survive the tumor which had encircled his lungs and heart.|$|E

Because of his need for care, Kaze Shindo moved into his apartment and lived with him for the last six years of his life, acting as his caregiver.

2500|$|Dwarfs, like fauns, satyrs, {{the river}} god and his Naiad daughters {{and the tree}} people (deities of the woods) stepped forth when Aslan (in The Magician's Nephew) called for Narnia to [...] "Awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters." [...] The dwarfs were presumably born of the earth, as the Dryads were {{of the trees and}} the Naiads of the waters. Dwarfs appear as the King's train-bearers at the {{coronation}} of King Frank. (Naiads held Queen Helen's robes) In keeping with their character as sons of Earth, the dwarfs are skilled and prolific smiths, miners, and carpenters. In battle they are renowned as deadly archers.

2500|$|At Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek {{writes that}} Dark Willow is [...] "far {{from being a}} cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the {{momentum}} of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff." [...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E

2500|$|WICB {{allowed the}} WSC players {{to appear in}} the 1979 World Cup, and the West Indies {{retained}} the title with little difficulty. By the end of 1979, the WSC disputes were resolved. Kallicharran was deposed after losing a six-match series one-nil in India and Lloyd returned as captain for a tour against a full-strength Australia (where the Windies won two-nil, with one draw) and New Zealand. The latter tour was full of controversy. New Zealand won the first Test at Dunedin by one wicket, but West Indies were never happy with the umpiring. West Indian discontent boiled over the next Test at Christchurch. While running into bowl, Colin Croft deliberately shouldered the umpire Fred Goodall. When Goodall went to talk to Lloyd about Croft's behaviour, he had to <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> the way to meet the West Indian captain, as the latter did not move an inch from his position at the slips. After tea on the third day, West Indies refused to take the field unless Goodall was removed. They were persuaded to continue, and it took intense negotiations between the two boards to keep the tour on track. The Kiwis won the three match series after the second and third Tests ended in draws. [...] Nevertheless, the defeat proved to be the West Indies last Test series loss for the next 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|After Amber {{failed to}} {{break-up}} with Josh, Daniel {{tried to keep}} his distance from her. However, Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) had already noticed their growing closeness, so she kissed Daniel to prompt a reaction and work out what was truly going on with them. Amber was [...] "gutted" [...] when she witnessed the kiss and it caused her to give into her feelings for Daniel and they kissed. Daniel was left feeling guilty about Josh and Phillipps commented [...] "He {{wants to be with}} Amber, but it's not in his nature to just <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> over people." [...] Phillipps liked that Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle as it was [...] "quite relatable" [...] for everyone. He thought the reaction to it had been mixed, but there had been support for Amber and Daniel. A few weeks later, Josh walked in on Amber and Daniel kissing. Bonner told an Inside Soap reporter that Josh was devastated by the scene {{and did not want to}} hear Amber's apology. Josh eventually went to the penthouse to speak with Daniel and came close to hitting him. He then smashed up Amber and Daniel's darkroom, knowing that is where they had spent a lot of their time together. Phillipps confirmed that Amber and Daniel would stay together despite the fallout and that they would grow closer because of it. The couple were given the portmanteau Damber by fans and critics.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa's departing storyline {{revolved}} around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking {{her daughter to}} live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: [...] "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark— passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, [...] "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} festival of the Saptashrungi temple is Chaitrotsav, [...] "the Chaitra festival". The festival starts on Rama Navami (the ninth lunar {{day in the}} bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Chaitra) and culminates on Chaitra Poornima (full moon day), the biggest day of the festival. The festival is also attended specifically by childless women making vows seeking blessings of goddess for children. About 250,000 attend the festival {{on the final day}} and as many as 1million gather on the last three days of the nine-day festival. The devotees come from states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Many devotees also <b>walk</b> <b>all</b> the way from Nashik (...) , Dhule (...) and other towns. Devotees often circumambulate (see pradakshina) the whole hill. Hindus generally circumbulate the deity or the sanctum, however since the goddess's icon is carved on the hill side, the whole hill has to be circumbulated. The goddess is bathed (see abhisheka) with panchamruta (panch meaning five and amruta meaning nectar of immortality), a mixture of usually honey, sugar, milk, yogurt, and ghee, every day during the festival. On the penultimate day (the fourteenth lunar day), the goddess' banner is worshiped and then paraded through the village in attendance of the village head-man (gavali-patil) of Daregaon village and finally hoisted on the hill peak at midnight. On the last day, devotees visit the hill top to take darshan (pay respects to) of the holy flag. This ceremony is reported to be held at least since the 15th century. Devotees who used a navas (vow) fulfill it during the festival.|$|E
