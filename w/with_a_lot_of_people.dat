5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{developed}} the concept {{for the show}} after reading The Killer Angels, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Shaara chronicling the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war and their experiences afterwards as pioneers and immigrants {{on the outskirts of}} civilization, much like the post-American Civil War era of Reconstruction and the American Old West culture. He intended the show to be [...] "a Stagecoach kind of drama <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> trying to figure out their lives in a bleak pioneer environment". Whedon wanted to develop a show about the tactile nature of life, a show where existence was more physical and more difficult. After reading The Killer Angels, Whedon read a book about Jewish partisan fighters in World War II that also influenced him. Whedon wanted to create something for television that was more character-driven and gritty than most modern science fiction. Television science fiction, he felt, had become too pristine and rarefied.|$|E

On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my job to do my best to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in Hollywood {{is that what they}} do in England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E

It's really important for me to take my time with this record and it's important for the whole team. It's really, really good energy." [...] She has been working on the album with a number of producers and songwriters, including Hit-Boy, Soundz, Diane Warren, Tricky Stewart, and The Underdogs. In {{an interview}}, Ciara said [...] "I worked with some people that are very fresh, which I'm excited about... When it comes to artists, when it comes to writers, when it comes to producers, I really wanted to push. We pretty much reached out and worked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that I've never worked with before, which is really fun." ...|$|E

This hill road twists and winds so you can only see part of it at a time, and when we was about half-way down we heard a horn blowing behind us, and looking around there came the mail-coach at full speed, with four horses, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> on top. As this raging coach passed by it nearly took my breath away, and as soon as I could speak I said to Jone: [...] "Don't you ever say anything in America about having the roads made narrower so that it won't cost so much to keep them in order, for in my opinion it's often the narrow road that leadeth to destruction." ...|$|E

I knew {{that you were going}} to journey by Kilwa; indeed it was your only route <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and so much baggage, and I did not wish to visit Kilwa." [...] He paused, then went on: [...] "A long while ago, nearly twenty-three years to be accurate, I went to live at Kilwa as a missionary with my young wife. I built a mission station and a church there, and we were happy and fairly successful in our work. Then on one evil day the Swahili and other Arabs came in dhows to establish a slave-dealing station. I resisted them, and the end of it was that they attacked us, killed most of my people and enslaved the rest. In that attack I received a cut from a sword on the head--look, here is the mark of it," [...] and drawing his white hair apart he showed us a long scar that was plainly visible in the moonlight.|$|E

60|$|Now that is {{just the}} way <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> The more they have and the less they have to worry about, the more discontented they become, and at last they are {{positively}} unhappy. There was little Danny Meadow Mouse, living out on the Green Meadows; he was happy all the livelong day, and yet he had no safe castle like the dear Old Briar-patch where he could always be safe. Every minute of every day Danny had to keep his eyes wide open and his wits working their very quickest, for any minute he was likely to be in danger. Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Granny Fox or Digger the Badger or Mr. Blacksnake was likely to come creeping through the grass any time, and they are always hungry for a fat Meadow Mouse. And as if that weren't worry enough, Danny had to watch the sky, too, for Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, or his cousin Redtail, or Blacky the Crow, each of whom would be glad of a Meadow Mouse dinner. Yet in spite of all this, Danny was happy and never once lost his appetite.|$|E
60|$|I {{first got}} to know Corky when I came to New York. He was a pal of my cousin Gussie, who was in <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> down Washington Square way. I don't know if I ever told you about it, but the reason why I left England was because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha {{to try to stop}} young Gussie marrying a girl on the {{vaudeville}} stage, and I got the whole thing so mixed up that I decided {{that it would be a}} sound scheme for me to stop on in America for a bit instead of going back and having long cosy chats about the thing with aunt. So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent apartment, and settled down for a bit of exile. I'm bound to say that New York's a topping place to be exiled in. Everybody was awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of things going on, and I'm a wealthy bird, so everything was fine. Chappies introduced me to other chappies, and so on and so forth, and it wasn't long before I knew squads of the right sort, some who rolled in dollars in houses up by the Park, and others who lived with the gas turned down mostly around Washington Square--artists and writers and so forth. Brainy coves.|$|E
6000|$|The {{worst was}} to come, then--and if {{the books were}} right this worst would be very bad. The {{experience}} {{of the last six}} hours had enlarged his conception of what heavy weather could be like. [...] "It'll be terrific," [...] he pronounced, mentally. He had not consciously looked at anything {{by the light of the}} matches except at the barometer; and yet somehow he had seen that his water-bottle and the two tumblers had been flung out of their stand. It seemed to give him a more intimate knowledge of the tossing the ship had gone through. [...] "I wouldn't have believed it," [...] he thought. And his table had been cleared, too; his rulers, his pencils, the inkstand--all the things that had their safe appointed places--they were gone, as if a mischievous hand had plucked them out one by one and flung them on the wet floor. The hurricane had broken in upon the orderly arrangements of his privacy. This had never happened before, and the feeling of dismay reached the very seat of his composure. And the worst was to come yet! He was glad the trouble in the 'tween-deck had been discovered in time. If the ship had to go after all, then, at least, she wouldn't be going to the bottom <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in her fighting teeth and claw. That would have been odious. And in that feeling there was a humane intention and a vague sense of the fitness of things.|$|E
