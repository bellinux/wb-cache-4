500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> our images clean." ...|$|E
500|$|Thomas and {{the crew}} also {{introduced}} several narrative changes to the show starting in the third season. Thomas wanted to [...] "invite new viewers to the show" [...] by [...] "trying {{to start with a}} clean slate" [...] and ridding the show of references to former plotlines and character development. With regards to [...] "Welcome Wagon", Thomas stated that he [...] "wanted episode one this year to not rely much on past knowledge." [...] He also tried to make the episode [...] "very sort of breezy, and chattery and funny." [...] The episode reintroduces the case of the Hearst serial rapist, a storyline presented in a second-season episode. In contrast to the previous seasons, which had several concurrent mysteries, Thomas planned for season 3 to have three consecutive mysteries, the first of which would be the serial rapist. [...] "To service a 22-episode mystery, {{you have to have a}} large playing field. To service a 9-episode mystery, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> that tighter, more focused." [...] It was made available on MSN for the week leading up to broadcast. However, the episode was only available for Microsoft users and not for Apple users.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

[...] A few weeks after the album's release, DreamWorks Records was absorbed by Interscope Records and not long after, the band was dropped from the label.

[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today {{than they were in the}} last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E
