5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose work hours have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their <b>work</b> <b>time</b> by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant <b>work</b> <b>time</b> was lost because of this.|$|E

25|$|Day for Night won Truffaut a Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1973. The film is {{probably}} his most reflective work. It {{is the story}} of a film crew trying to finish their film while dealing with all of the personal and professional problems that accompany making a movie. Truffaut plays the director of the fictional film being made. This film features scenes shown in his previous films. It is considered to be his best film since his earliest <b>work.</b> <b>Time</b> magazine placed it on their list of 100 Best Films of the Century (along with The 400 Blows).|$|E

It uses a fly-on-the-wall approach to cover nearly {{every aspect of}} production, from production management and scheduling to music direction to special effects. The behind-the-scenes documentary is an in-depth look into Anderson's motivation and directing style. Pre-production included a screening of the film Network (1976), as well as Ordinary People (1980). Several scenes showed Anderson {{at odds with the}} child actors and labor laws that restrict their <b>work</b> <b>time.</b> The character of Dixon has further scenes filmed but, from Anderson's reactions, appear not to be working. These scenes were cut completely and have never been shown on DVD.|$|E

Run Ling, the {{ancestor}} of Lanying Lin, was an imperial censor during the Ming Dynasty. Imperial censor is an official position that controls and supervises other government officials. During his <b>work</b> <b>time,</b> he faced two powerful people who broke many laws. He helped the emperor conquer the two contenders to power, so the emperor gave him money to build a magnificent house in Putian, which is now called the Old House of Run Ling. The ancestors of Lanying Lin and Lanying Lin herself were all born and raised in this house. Because of Run Ling, the family of Lanying Lin can be considered to be nobles.|$|E
25|$|Living {{and working}} {{conditions}} in the camps varied significantly across time and place, depending, among other things, {{on the impact of}} broader events (World War II, countrywide famines and shortages, waves of terror, sudden influx or release of large numbers of prisoners). However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor. In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official <b>work</b> <b>time</b> regulations were extended by local camp administrators.|$|E

[...] These high costs are {{due in part to the}} large percentage of hospital admissions for head injury that are due to mild head trauma, but indirect costs such as lost <b>work</b> <b>time</b> and early retirement account for the bulk of the costs.

Each child had {{his or her own}} semi-private space with a fold-down seat, reading light, and bookshelf. The goal was to provide private spaces where third grade (eight-year-old) children could develop good study habits, and the school found that the children spent 90 percent of their <b>work</b> <b>time</b> in their learning spaces. The structures were featured in local news stories and in Life magazine. ACS patented the invention and sold models to several local schools.

Black Sabbath's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist Mob Rules was released in October 1981, to be well received by fans, but less so by the critics. Rolling Stone reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming [...] "Mob Rules finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever". Like most of the band's earlier <b>work,</b> <b>time</b> helped to improve the opinions of the music press, a decade after its release, Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called Mob Rules [...] "a magnificent record".

500|$|Whenever {{there is}} talk about new {{policies}} regarding new <b>work</b> <b>time</b> policies, there is often the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.|$|E
