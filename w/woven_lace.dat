40|$|Rouge Mistral was {{developed}} from pre-consumer textile waste (discarded textile scraps) from university apparel design workrooms. Rouge Mistral employed a tufting textile fabrication technique where narrow strips of discarded textiles scraps were pushed up {{through an open}} weave textile (discarded burlap coffee bean sack) forming loops {{on the right side}} of the cape. The tufted design of the cape was inspired by the strong Mistral wind that blows from southern France into the Gulf of Lion. The dress portion of the ensemble was strategically designed and draped for maximum utilization of remaining discarded textiles. Side panels of dress were shaped with curved seams to compliment the Mistral swirling influence in the cape. A variety of textiles were utilized in this design: natural, synthetic, and blended fibers in knits, plain <b>weaves,</b> <b>lace,</b> and netting to name a few. Production of Rouge Mistral kept approximately 5 pounds of textiles from entering landfills...|$|R
50|$|Such an {{emphasis}} on media is a natural outgrowth of the internal classification systems used in art museums, which usually include departments of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, and works on paper. Painting itself includes several media, such as oil painting, Tempera painting, watercolor. Sculpture {{can be divided into}} carving and casting. The decorative arts are perhaps the most diverse, as they include: textiles and needlework, which includes <b>weaving,</b> <b>lace,</b> shibori, and other work with fabric; Murals, of which frescoes are one form; and objects of adornment such as silver, ceramics, lacquerware, stained glass, and furniture. Museums generally cannot collect full buildings, but they may acquire pieces of architectural ornamentation, which also fall under the decorative arts department. Works on paper includes printmaking, photography, and the book arts such as illuminated manuscripts. Museums may also include a department of applied arts, which includes objects of good design along with the graphic art, illustration, and other forms of commercial art.|$|R

50|$|The {{most recent}} {{development}} in <b>weave</b> extensions are <b>lace</b> fronts, {{which are made}} from a nylon mesh material formed into a cap that is then hand-ventilated by knotting single strands of hair into the tiny openings of the cap, giving the hair a more natural and authentic continuity than typical extensions. It has few variations including straight, wavy and curly. Furthermore, the extension units can be woven in or attached to a person's hairline with special adhesives. To ensure a proper fit, head measurements {{are taken into account}} with this type of <b>weave.</b> A <b>lace</b> frontal is best placed by a professional since more advanced weaving and hair extensions are used. This method is commonly used because it makes it possible to have access to a certain part of their scalp.|$|R

He {{was the son of}} a cotton weaver, and it was his parents' desire that he should become a physician, but, his father's {{business}} not being successful, he was unable to continue his studies, and so turned his attention to inventing. He showed an inventive genius at the early age of 14, when he invented a machine to manufacture piping cord, for which he received $100. Before he had reached the age of 18, he had devised a handloom for suspender webbing. His work on Stenography, a short manual on shorthand writing, was written and published about this time. In 1838, he invented a power loom for weaving knotted counterpanes, and later a power loom to <b>weave</b> coach <b>lace</b> and took his brother, Horatio, in with him.|$|R

5000|$|Caddoan Mississippian peoples were {{connected}} to the larger Mississippian world {{to the east and}} other cultures to the southwest by trade networks which spanned the North American continent. Artifacts found in [...] "The Great Mortuary" [...] (Craig Mound) at the Spiro site included wood, conch shell, copper, basketry, <b>woven</b> fabric, <b>lace,</b> fur, feathers, and carved stone statues. Some artifacts came {{from as far away as}} Cahokia in Illinois, Etowah and Ocmulgee in Georgia, and Moundville in Alabama. Many featured the elaborate symbolism of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a multiregional and pan-linguistic trade and religious network. Exotic material found at Caddoan Mississippian sites included colored flint from New Mexico, copper from the Great Lakes, conch (or lightning whelk) shells from the Gulf Coast, and mica from the Carolinas. The Spiro site is the only Mississippian site to produce an artifact from Mesoamerica, a piece of black obsidian from Mexico, probably through trade with peoples to the southwest. Using these valued materials, Mississippian artists created exquisite works of art reflecting their cultural identity and their complex spiritual beliefs.|$|R

60|$|In {{all other}} respects he lived a {{harmless}} life {{during the three}} years of his sojourn in the Val de Travers. As he could never endure {{what he calls the}} inactive chattering of the parlour--people sitting in front of one another with folded hands and nothing in motion except the tongue--he learnt the art of making laces; he used to carry his pillow about with him, or sat at his own door working like the women of the village, and chatting with the passers-by. He made presents of his work to young women about to marry, always on the condition that they should suckle their children when they came to have them. If a little whimsical, it was a harmless and respectable pastime. It is pleasanter to think of a philosopher finding diversion in <b>weaving</b> <b>laces,</b> than of noblemen making it the business of their lives to run after ribands. A society clothed in breeches was incensed about the same time by Rousseau's adoption of the Armenian costume, the vest, the furred bonnet, the caftan, and the girdle. There was nothing very wonderful in this departure from use. An Armenian tailor used often to visit some friends at Montmorency. Rousseau knew him, and reflected that such a dress would be of singular comfort to him in the circumstances of his bodily disorder.[137] Here was a solid practical reason for what has usually been counted a demonstration of a turned brain. Rousseau had as good cause for going about in a caftan as Chatham had for coming to the House of Parliament wrapped in flannel. Vanity and a desire to attract notice may, we admit, {{have had something to do}} with Rousseau's adoption of an uncommon way of dressing. Shrewd wits like the Duke of Luxembourg and his wife did not suppose that it was so. We, living a hundred years after, cannot possibly know whether it was so or not, and our estimate of Rousseau's strange character would be very little worth forming, if it only turned on petty singularities of this kind. The foolish, equivocally gifted with the quality of articulate speech, may, if they choose, satisfy their own self-love by reducing all action out of the common course to a series of variations on the same motive in others. Men blessed by the benignity of experience will be thankful not to waste life in guessing evil about unknowable trifles.|$|R
50|$|Silk {{processing}} {{skills were}} established in England by French Protestant Huguenots refugees after they had been expelled France following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. They prospered in Spitalfields, outside the bounds of the City of London, where they avoided the restrictive legislation of the City Guilds. But silk-throwing was already happening in Cheshire, for example in Rainow where a John Massey is recorded as owning one black cow, some sheep, three old ladders and a silk twisting wheel. <b>Lace</b> <b>weaving</b> was already under way in Stockport, Macclesfield, Congleton, Leek and Buxton in around 1660. Narrow silk weaving was happening in Macclesfield by 1696, while John Prout (1829) states that broad-silk weaving commenced in 1756.|$|R

40|$|When Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV 2 ̆ 7 s {{minister}} for finance and economic affairs, said: 2 ̆ 2 Fashion is to France what gold mines are to the Spaniards, 2 ̆ 2 (quoted by Minchinton 1977, 112) he recognized how significant the manufactory of fashionable luxury textiles was for the economy of France. During {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} century many absolutist rulers of Europe who pursued mercantilist policies fostered the production and trade of expensive textiles. Tremendous resources went into the making of <b>woven</b> silks, <b>lace,</b> tapestries, fine embroideries and table linens. The best designers and craftsmen were employed who used the most valued materials, such as silk, precious metals and stone. Textiles, as they appear in painting and surviving pieces, are to a considerable degree responsible for our notion of the seventeenth and eighteenth century as an era of extravagant luxury and splendor. A study of the interrelationship of luxury textiles and the theories and policies of mercantilism will provide the historical background necessary to understand why this period created textiles of extraordinary artistic and technical quality. Although the usefulness of the term mercantilism has been questioned by some (De Vries 1976, 236 and Blaich 1973, 1 - 10), {{in the context of this}} paper the following widely used definition is still helpful. Here the term mercantilism refers to economic theories and policies which European countries applied to different degrees and at various periods during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Implementing mercantilist policies governments forcefully intervened in economic processes in order to expand national income and to use economic power for political ends (Minchinton 1969,vii and De Vries 1976, 236 - 237). Striving for a positive trade balance rulers sought to accumulate monetary wealth which they regarded the key to political power. For the first time governments extensively and systematically used protectionist measures to increase the production and trade of goods. They granted generous financial support and privileges to new enterprises, controlled the quality of goods through industry regulations, and tried to ward off the import of competing foreign goods through high custom duties...|$|R
40|$|Participation in popular, or worldly, {{culture was}} a moot {{point for the}} early Friends. Although they were not {{encouraged}} to do so many still took part in aspects of male or female culture, but experienced tension between Quaker and 2 ̆ 7 carnal 2 ̆ 7 ideals of behaviour. Female Friends were expected to limit their clothing according to the edicts of their Yearly Meeting, although female culture treated clothing as a medium of exchange and 2 ̆ 7 gifting clothing was central to female social life. This proved difficult for women such as Sarah Kirkby (d. 1692) of Auckland, a fabric seller, who traded with non-Quakers and could not have avoided the expectation that she would participate in aspects of female culture. Even Margaret Fell 2 ̆ 7 s daughters succumbed, as their household book testifies, although Durham Quakers and the Fells 2 ̆ 7 meeting at Swarthmore agreed that silk <b>weaving</b> and selling <b>lace</b> respectively were inappropriate trades for a Friend. 2 ̆ 7 From the 1680 s Women 2 ̆ 7 s Quarterly Meetings sent epistles on the subject to Monthly and Preparative Meetings, who reported back their findings. At almost every women 2 ̆ 7 s meeting lists of forbidden garments were noted and their wearers, usually young women, were reprimanded. Female Friends who deviated from this rule {{were likely to be}} condemned as 2 ̆ 7 disorderly walkers 2 ̆ 7, and the censure of their families was expected. Such clothing was not merely seen as 2 ̆ 7 light 2 ̆ 7 or wasteful, but deeply immoral as it sullied the image male Friends had constructed of women as symbols of the purity of the restored Church. Men were treated with more sympathy than women if they strayed, and the temptations they experienced were more often related to the alehouse than to clothing. Women were sometimes accused of drunkenness and disorder. A disorderly wife was seen as bringing dishonour to Quakerism, as it gave the impression that Quaker men could not control their wives, even though they had arguably already taken steps to do so by instituting separate meetings and limiting the activities of female ministers. However, wives of alcoholic husbands were advised to treat them with respect, not contempt. Friends seem to have appreciated the tensions faced by many men, who had formerly participated in alehouse culture alongside their peers, and found it difficult to break this tie to their old lifestyles. By the early eighteenth century the 2 ̆ 7 perruque controversy 2 ̆ 7 led Quaker men also to consider their own appearances and condemn the use of wigs as bodily adornment. Although this may seem to suggest equality, alongside their uniform rejection of ostentation surrounding any rite of passage regardless of the participants 2 ̆ 7 social status, it ultimately led to John Wesley 2 ̆ 7 s condemnation of Quaker costume as a 2 ̆ 7 uniform 2 ̆ 7. This also gave rise to the belief that there was a uniformity of thinking, which had abandoned the originality of earlier thought, most notably their justification of women preachers...|$|R
