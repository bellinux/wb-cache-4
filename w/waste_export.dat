The health and environmental issues exposed by this report and subsequent scientific studies have greatly concerned international {{organizations such as the}} Basel Action Network and later Greenpeace and the United Nations Environment Programme and the Basel Convention. Media documentation of Guiyu is tightly regulated by the Chinese government, for fear of exposure or legal action. For example, a November 2008 news story by 60 Minutes, a popular US TV news program, documented the illegal shipments of electronic waste from recyclers in the US to Guiyu. While taping part of the story on-site at an illegal recycling dump in Guiyu, representatives of the Chinese recyclers attempted without success to confiscate the footage from the 60 Minutes TV crew. Greenpeace has protested the environmental impacts of e-waste recycling in Guiyu using different methods to raise awareness such as building a statue using e-waste collected from a site in Guiyu, or delivering a truckload of e-waste dumped in Guiyu back to Hewlett Packard headquarters. Greenpeace has been lobbying large consumer electronics companies to stop using toxic substances in their products, with varying degrees of effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{dissertation}} is {{to evaluate}} waste management policies to limit municipal solid waste (MSW) production and disposal of garbage. Understanding MSW production and disposal is of prime importance for communities to choose appropriate policy instruments to attain their garbage disposal targets. Notwithstanding the extensive interest of scholars during the last decades, {{new developments in the}} MSW market reveal important shortcomings in both empiric and theoretic research. In particular we identify three potential sources of bias when evaluating economic and political incentives for reducing MSW disposal. It is our goal to tackle these three shortcomings and demonstrate their impact by means of specific case studies. First, as indicated by Besley and Case (2000), if policy intervention is responsive to economic and political conditions within its jurisdiction, then {{it may be necessary to}} control or to correct for the forces that cause the policy to change if one wishes to obtain estimates of a policys incidence. Techniques to circumvent this endogeneity problem, such as difference-in-differences, matching, instrumental variables and, Heckmans two-stage estimator, are commonly used methods for program evaluation. However, when assessing effectiveness of waste reduction policies these statistical methods are rarely used. In the first chapter (published in waste Management, see De Jaeger and Eyckmans, 2008) we will give an introduction to one of these techniques the difference-in-differences (or DD) estimator and argue that it is a useful tool for assessing waste management policies. We start by showing that existing dynamic DD techniques can be extended to accommodate for more than one treatment group. Next, we apply this technique to a Flemish voluntary waste policy program to demonstrate its relevance for evaluating MSW management policies. In the second chapter (published in Waste Management and Research, see De Jaeger, 2009) we further extend the DD methodology in order to evaluate the real impact of weight-based pricing schedules in MSW. The main idea is to use historical observations on MSW production to determine which version of the difference-in-differences technique is most suitable to assess the impact of a policy action on MSW quantities. Second, numerous empirical studies in the field of strategic tax policy interaction among local governments have shown the existence of spatial policy interaction. Heyndels and Vuchelen (1998), for instance, show that local income and property tax policies are strongly correlated among neighbouring municipalities in Belgium. A similar principle appears to be true for MSW taxes. In chapter 3 we set up a two-stage theoretical model of consumers demand and municipalities pricing policy for residual MSW collection and processing. We test the predictions from this model using the proper techniques in spatial econometrics. The results indicate, as predicted by our model, local governments strategically interact with each other when setting the price for MSW. Based on chapter 3 we can conclude local policy makers mimic waste tax rates because they believe voters try to overcome information asymmetries by comparing the local policies with neighbouring municipalities when evaluating the performance of their incumbents. In chapter 5 we go a step further and explicitly test for political costs in terms of popularity scores. We test if voters indeed use neighbouring tax rates as a yardstick, or if other principles drive their attitude towards tax rates. As expected, voters do not engage in yardstick voting, but are rather averse to increases in MSW tax rates in general. Third, in responses to financial incentives to reduce waste, like unit based-pricing, households might be tempted to engage in illicit behaviour as an alternative to recycling, composting or adjusting purchasing habits. The possibility of increasing illegal forms of waste disposal has always been an important concern for local policy makers when deciding on the payment schemes. New (but anecdotic) evidence suggests the existence of a form of illegal waste dumping which has not yet been analysed in the literature. If neighbouring municipalities charge significantly different prices at their recycling sites, residents have an incentive to present their waste at the cheapest location. As the prices often do not reflect the true processing costs for the municipalities, waste import is perceived as problematic by the local policy makers. In chapter 4 we present a simple theoretical model of consumers demand for waste collection and processing facilities and test the predictions from the model using a set of spatial econometric tools. Our estimation results indicate that bulky household refuse levels indeed depend on the prices charged in neighbouring municipalities. For other waste fractions like demolition waste, garden waste, scrap metal and wood waste we find no proof for <b>waste</b> <b>export.</b> This is not surprising as we argue some waste fractions are more sensitive to spatial differences in prices than others. Finally chapter 6 (published in Waste Management, see De Jaeger et al., 2011) studies the impact of some local policies aimed at MSW reduction on the cost efficiency of MSW collection and disposal. We explicitly account for endogeneity of local policies by using a bootstrapped version of the Data Envelopment Analysis methodology in combination with a matching technique. Our results indicate that municipalities that are member of a waste collection joint venture, or that subscribe to a voluntary agreement to reduce MSW at the highest ambition level, collect and process MSW more efficiently than other municipalities. Weekly instead of two-weekly waste collection, or using a weight-based pricing system appears to have no impact on efficiency. Our results show that aiming at MSW reduction does not lead to lower efficiency of public service provision, even on the contrary. Key references Besley, T. J. and A. C.

The second point concerns the degree to which modernization has led to an improvement in the environmental impacts associated with market economies and their production systems. Drawing on ecological modernization, risk society, and the treadmill of production theories, I argue that, as with popular and scholarly views on racism, many scholars have overstated the level of progress society has made on this front. I also argue that this is largely because - via practices such as environmental racism and globalization - many of the worst dimensions of the market economy's externalities are out of sight and out of mind (due largely to spatial and residential segregation and international hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>exports),</b> making it possible to either ignore or dismiss claims to the contrary...|$|R

Then, we rely on a negative binomial regression model to test our theoretical results using data on international trade of polyethylene waste. Empirical results do not reject theoretical predictions, although some exceptions arise. A first striking result is that exporting prices do not seem to matter in export flows.

(My remarks today will focus almost exclusively on municipal solid waste and hazardous waste). All of us are most familiar with municipal solid waste. Where does municipal solid waste end up? The vast majority of U. S. municipal solid waste - 57 percent - goes to landfills. Twenty-two percent of U. S. municipal solid waste is recycled, fifteen percent is incinerated, and six percent is composted. Over thirty million tons of that waste - that is, over 11 percent of the total waste stream - crosses state lines each year. Eighty percent of that waste goes to a neighboring state; going through one state to take the trash to another is much less common. Why does waste move across boundaries both between states and between Canada and the United States? People are trying to dispose of their waste at the lowest cost, and there are several reasons why we might move trash across the border. It might be more convenient; the closest landfill may not be within your state or province, but just across the border. It may also be that you have a shortage of landfills in your home state or province. Another reason that waste can move is because of differences in regulatory regimes between jurisdictions.
