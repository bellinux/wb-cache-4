[...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer...

Moses would sooner die like a man helping his countrymen, than live on the fat of the land while they were slaves. And forty years before he had shown the same spirit too, when though he was rich and prosperous, and high in the world, the adopted son of King Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus ii. 11), he disdained to be a slave and to see his countrymen slaves round him. We read how he killed an Egyptian, who was ill-treating one of his brothers, the Jews--and how he then fled out of Egypt into Midian, houseless and friendless, esteeming as St. Paul says, [...] "the reproach of Christ"--that is the affliction and ill-will which came on him for doing right, [...] "better than all the treasures of Egypt" [...] (Heb xi. 24-27).|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{argues that}} the origin of {{narrative}} lies in the âexcuse â and that {{the structure of the}} excuse marks what we nowadays consider as narrative. The defining feature of the excuse is that it provides a counter- version to the master story of the accusation and thereby opens a multiplicity of versions. Given an excuse, there is not just a plurality of possible plot developments but also a consideration of lin-guistic nuances when weighing responsibility. The excuse generates a context within which the acts of the speaker appear in a different light or as elements of a different story; hence, the excuse should be described as a context- generating act. The article considers the features of the excuse, links excuse and narrative, provides an evolu-tionary consideration of the function of the excuse narrative and indicates how the excuse narrative is a key feature of fiction.

60|$|The gentlemen who {{defend the}} science make this reply, they allow the credit and {{authority}} of Aristotle {{as much as}} the objectors; but as the objectors themselves deny all the authorities for the spirits, and desire that reason may be the only ground they go upon, so the refuters, on their parts desire, that Aristotle's ipse dixit may not be absolutely passed upon them for argument; but that his words may be brought to the same touchstone of reason, and proved if they are standard. If this argument, say they, will hold good, Aristotle should not suppose intelligences moving the celestial spheres; for God sufficeth to move all without ministering spirits; nor would there be need of a sun in the world, for God can enlighten all things by himself, and so all second causes were to be taken away; therefore, there are angels and ministering spirits in the world, for the majesty of God, not for his want of them, and for order, not for his omnipotency. And here if the objectors return and say, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there are spirits; Is not yours a precarious hypothesis? May not we have leave to recriminate in this place? Pray, who told Aristotle that there were intelligences that moved the celestial spheres? Is not this hypothesis as precarious as any man may pretend that of spirits to be? And we believe there are few philosophers at present who agree with Aristotle in that opinion; and we dare pronounce this to be ours, that Aristotle took his intelligences from the Hebrews, who went according to the same whimsical, though pretty notion, which first gave rise to the fiction of the nine muses. But more than all this, it is a very great doubt among learned men, whether this book de Mundo be Aristotle's or no.|$|E
6000|$|Pordenone {{flushed with}} anger and shame to be taken [...] At an {{unguarded}} point; but he answered with scornful defiance: [...] "Oh, you are come, I see, with the favorite weapon of Titian, [...] And you would make a battle of words. If you care for my counsel, [...] Listen to me: I say you are skilfuller far in my absence, [...] And your tongue can inflict a keener and deadlier mischief [...] When it is dipped in poisonous lies, and wielded in secret." [...] "Nay, then," [...] Titian responded, [...] "methinks that our friend Aretino[6] [...] Makes a much better effect than either of us in that tongue-play. [...] But since Messer Robusti has measured our wit for his portrait, [...] Even he has grown shyer of using his tongue than he once was. [...] Have you not heard the tale? Tintoretto was told Aretino [...] Meant to make him the subject {{of one of his}} merry effusions; [...] And with his naked dirk he went carefully over his person, [...] Promising, if the poet made free with him in his verses, [...] He would immortalize my satirical friend with that pencil. [...] Doubtless the tale is not true. Aretino says nothing about it; [...] Always speaks, in fact, with the highest respect of Robusti. [...] True or not, 'tis well found." [...] Then looking around on the frescos: [...] "Good, very good indeed! Your breadth and richness and softness [...] No man living surpasses; those heads are truly majestic. [...] Yes, Buonarotti was right, when he said that to look at your [...] Curtius [...] Richly repaid him the trouble and cost of a journey from Florence. [...] Surely the world shall know you the first of painters in fresco! [...] Well? You will not strike me unarmed? This was hardly expected [...] By the good people that taught you to think our rivalry blood-red. [...] Let us be friends, Pordenone!" [...] "Be patron and patronized, rather; [...] Nay, if you spoke your whole mind out, be assassin and victim. [...] Could the life beat again in the broken heart of Giorgione, [...] He might tell us, I think, something pleasant of friendship with [...] Titian." [...] Suddenly over the shoulder of Titian peered an ironical visage, [...] Smiling, malignly intent--the leer of the scurrilous poet: [...] "You know--all the world knows--who dug the grave of Giorgione.[7] [...] Titian and he were no friends--our Lady of Sorrows forgive 'em! [...] But for all hurt that Titian did him he might have been living, [...] Greater than any living, and lord of renown and such glory [...] As would have left you both dull as yon withered moon in the [...] sunshine." [...] Loud laughed the listening group at the insolent gibe of the poet, [...] Stirring the gall to its depths in the bitter soul of their master, [...] Who with his tremulous fingers tapped the hilt of his poniard, [...] Answering naught as yet. Anon the glance of the ribald, [...] Carelessly ranging from Pordenone's face to the picture, [...] Dwelt with an absent light on its marvellous beauty, and kindled [...] Into a slow recognition, with [...] "Ha! Violante!" [...] Then, erring [...] Wilfully as to the subject, he cackled his filthy derision: [...] "What have we here! More Magdalens yet of the painter's acquaintance? [...] Ah--!" [...] The words had scarce left his lips, when the painter [...] Rushed upon him, and clutching his throat, thrust him backward and [...] held him [...] Over the scaffolding's edge in air, and straightway had flung him [...] Crashing down on the pave of the cloister below, but for Titian, [...] Who around painter and poet alike wound his strong arms and stayed [...] them [...] Solely, until the bewildered pupils could come to the rescue. [...] Then, as the foes relaxed that embrace of frenzy and murder-- [...] White, one with rage and the other with terror, and either with [...] hatred-- [...] Grimly the great master smiled: [...] "You were much nearer paradise, [...] Piero, [...] Than you have been for some time. Be ruled now by me and get [...] homeward [...] Fast as you may, and be thankful." [...] And then, as the poet, [...] Looking neither to right nor to left, amid the smiles of the pupils [...] Tottered along the platform, and trembling descended the ladder [...] Down to the cloister pave, and, still without upward or backward [...] Glance, disappeared beneath the outer door of the Convent, [...] Titian turned again to the painter: [...] "Farewell, Pordenone! [...] Learn more fairly to know me. I envy you not; and no rival [...] Now, or at any time, have I held you, or ever shall hold you. [...] Prosper and triumph still, for all me: you shall but do me honor, [...] Seeing that I too serve the art that your triumphs illustrate. [...] I for my part find life too short for work and for pleasure; [...] If it should touch a century's bound, I should think it too [...] precious [...] Even to spare a moment for rage at another's good fortune. [...] Do not be fooled by the purblind flatterers who would persuade you [...] Either of us shall have greater fame through the fall of the other. [...] We can thrive only in common. The tardily blossoming cycles, [...] Flowering at last in this glorious age of our art, had not waited, [...] Folded calyxes still, for Pordenone or Titian. [...] Think you if we had not been, our pictures had never been painted? [...] Others had done them, or better, the same. We are only [...] Pencils God paints with. And think you that He had wanted for [...] pencils [...] But for our being at hand? And yet--for some virtue creative [...] Dwells and divinely exists in the being of every creature, [...] So that the thing done through him is dear as if he had done it-- [...] If I should see your power, a tint of this great efflorescence, [...] Fading, methinks I should feel myself beginning to wither. [...] They have abused your hate <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Titian was jealous. [...] Once, in my youth that is passed, I too had my hates and my envies. [...] 'Sdeath! how it used to gall me--that power and depth of Giorgione! [...] I could have turned my knife in his heart when I looked at his [...] portraits. [...] Ah! we learn somewhat still as the years go. Now, when I see you [...] Doing this good work here, I am glad in my soul of its beauty. [...] Art is not ours, O friend! but if we are not hers, we are nothing. [...] Look at the face you painted last year--or yesterday, even: [...] Far, so far, it seems from you, so utterly, finally, parted, [...] Nothing is stranger to you than this child of your soul; and you [...] wonder-- [...] 'Did I indeed then do it?' No thrill of the rapture of doing [...] Stirs in your breast at the sight. Nay, then, not even the beauty [...] Which we had seemed to create is our own: the frame universal [...] Is as much ours. And shall I hate you because you are doing [...] That which when done you cannot feel yours more than I mine can feel [...] it? [...] It shall belong hereafter to all who perceive and enjoy it, [...] Rather than him who made it; he, least of all, shall enjoy it. [...] They of the Church conjure us to look on death and be humble; [...] I say, look upon life and keep your pride if you can, then: [...] See how to-day's achievement is only to-morrow's confusion; [...] See how possession always cheapens the thing that was precious [...] To our endeavor; how losses and gains are equally losses; [...] How in ourselves we are nothing, and how we are anything only [...] As indifferent parts of the whole, that still, on our ceasing, [...] Whole remains as before, no less without us than with us. [...] Were it not for the delight of doing, the wonderful instant [...] Ere the thing done is done and dead, life scarce were worth living. [...] Ah, but that makes life divine! We are gods, for that instant [...] immortal, [...] Mortal for evermore, with a few days' rumor--or ages'-- [...] What does it matter? We, too, have our share of eating and [...] drinking, [...] Love, and the liking of friends--mankind's common portion and [...] pleasure. [...] Come, Pordenone, with me; I would fain have you see my Assumption [...] While it is still unfinished, and stay with me for the evening: [...] You shall send home for your lute, and I'll ask Sansovino to [...] supper.[8] [...] After what happened just now I scarcely could ask Aretino; [...] Though, for the matter of that, the dog is not one to bear malice.

And you, men, and mothers, who are here face to face with me to-night, I call upon you to say which of these is human, and which inhuman--which 'natural' and which 'unnatural?'
