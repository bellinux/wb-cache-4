50|$|Calcium oxalate stones form in an acidic to neutral urine. Two types {{naturally}} occur, {{calcium oxalate}} monohydrate, or whewellite (CaC2O4·H2O), and calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite (CaC2O4·2H2O). Their appearance can be rough, smooth, spiculated (needle-like), or jackstone. Calcium oxalate stones form more readily in animals with hypercalcaemia, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>caused</b> by Addison's disease or {{certain types of}} cancer.

5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> fatigue fractures.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{a highly}} fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) {{which is similar to}} AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, a relatively small list of pathogenic bacteria <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> infectious diseases. One of the bacterial diseases with the highest disease burden is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be <b>caused</b> by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and foodborne illnesses, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be <b>caused</b> by bacteria such as Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella.

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the hooded pitohui. Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors.
