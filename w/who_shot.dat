5|$|Springfield's Most Wanted was a TV special {{hosted by}} John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted. The special aired on September 17, 1995, before Part Two of <b>Who</b> <b>Shot</b> Mr. Burns?. A parody of Walsh's {{television}} series, this special {{was designed to}} help people find out <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> Mr. Burns, by laying out the potential clues and identifying the possible suspects. It features opinions from former Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and predictions from Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue. It was directed by Bill Brown and written by Jack Parmeter and Bob Bain.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 25 people were shot, six of whom died (including the perpetrator, <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> himself before police arrived). One witness {{reported}} that the gunman shot at least 30 rounds; police later collected 48 shell casings and 6 shotgun shells.|$|E
5|$|In I'm just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story, Hays also {{asserts that}} Kinne was {{inspired}} to kill her husband by a police magazine she read that {{told the story of}} Lillian Chastain, a Virginia woman <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> her husband during an argument and blamed the gunshot on the couple's two-year-old daughter. Charges against Chastain were filed in February 1960, weeks before James Kinne's death.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{two other}} people were wounded. They were Sergeant DeMonte Cheeley, a Marine {{recruiter}} <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the leg, treated, and released; and Dennis Pedigo, Jr., a police sergeant <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the ankle.|$|R
50|$|The living victims {{included}} a woman {{seven months pregnant}} <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the neck, another <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the thigh, a third <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the hand, and a fourth whose injuries were not further specified; all were expected to survive. All four were recovering at Froedtert Hospital from their gunshot wounds, three of them being in satisfactory condition and the fourth in critical condition; three of these victims required surgery.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{students}} <b>who</b> were <b>shot</b> had been protesting the Cambodian Campaign, which President Richard Nixon announced during a television address on April 30. Other students <b>who</b> were <b>shot</b> had been walking nearby or observing the protest from a distance.|$|R
5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to {{one side or the other}} told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> first.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated that the Taliban gunman <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> Yousafzai had been identified. Police named 23-year-old Atta Ullah Khan, a {{graduate}} student in chemistry, as the gunman in the attack. As of 2015 he remained at large, possibly in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied prisoners {{who were being}} {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him to}} the fort. Along the way they encountered other Indians, <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E

5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|In early May, {{part of the}} {{battalion}} was sent to reinforce the 3rd Battalion. At around midnight {{on the night of}} 3/4 May, the 2nd Battalion's commanding officer, Braund, who was partially deaf, was accidentally killed as he attempted to visit 1st Brigade headquarters after failing to hear a challenge from a sentry, <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> him believing that he was an enemy soldier. Following his burial, {{the battalion}} second-in-command, Robert Scobie, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and took over as commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, June 16, 1856, Strang was waylaid around 7:00 PM on {{the dock}} at the harbor of St. James, chief city of Beaver Island, by Wentworth and Bedford, <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> him in the back. All of this {{was carried out in}} full view of several {{officers}} and men of the , a US Naval vessel docked in the harbor. Not one person on board the ship made any effort to warn or to aid the intended victim.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the teams' passing {{remained}} {{the main difference between}} them; however, in the 16thminute, Barcelona lost the ball and Ryan Giggs sent a long ball forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo's first touch took him inside Piqué before going back outside the former Manchester United defender, who cynically blocked Ronaldo's run, earning himself the first yellow card of the match. Ronaldo shaped to take the free kick himself, but it was Giggs <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> for goal, only to curl the ball just over the bar.|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to {{one side or the}} other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|At {{first light}} on 6 November, Carlson and his command group, {{two of his}} companies, {{and a group of}} native scouts and {{carriers}} commanded by Major John Mather of the Australian Army and Sergeant Major Jacob C. Vouza of the Solomon Islands Police Force set out from Aola on the patrol. The group marched along a jungle trail northwest to the Reko River, arriving on 7 November. At the Reko, Carlson learned that the local Christian mission had recently been raided by Japanese troops who had killed two of the missionaries before moving west. Pushing across the river with one platoon of troops, Carlson encountered a small group of Japanese <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> and severely wounded the native scout leading the Marine column. Returning fire, the Marines killed two Japanese soldiers and drove off another three or four. Carlson's main body then arrived and the column bivouacked for the night.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, St. Louis was the {{location}} of a large ammunition factory and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory. Area factories also produced uniforms and footwear, K-rations, and chemicals and medicines. The uranium used in the Manhattan Project was refined in St. Louis by Mallinckrodt Chemical Company starting in 1942, and several atomic bomb scientists had ties to St. Louis, including Arthur Compton. At the start of the war, many German, Italian, and Japanese St. Louisans were interrogated or arrested, while the FBI investigated charges of sedition in the area. Residents engaged in civil defense drills and supported the war effort with scrap drives and war bond purchases. St. Louis produced several notable soldiers in the war, including Edward O'Hare, who grew up in St. Louis and won the Medal of Honor for combat in the Pacific. St. Louis also was home to Wendell O. Pruitt, an African-American pilot <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> down three enemy aircraft and destroyed multiple ground targets in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{the world}} premiere of the film Union Pacific was held in Omaha, Nebraska and the {{accompanying}} three-day celebration drew 250,000 people. A special train from Hollywood carried director Cecil B. DeMille and stars Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. Omaha's Boys Town was made famous by the Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney movie Boys Town. Omaha has been featured in recent years by a handful of relatively big budget motion pictures. The city's most extensive exposure can be accredited to Omaha native Alexander Payne, the Oscar-nominated director <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> parts of About Schmidt, Citizen Ruth and Election in the city and suburbs of Papillion and La Vista.|$|E

50|$|Three {{hostages and}} a police officer were wounded by police gunfire during the raid. The three hostages were Marcia Mikhael, <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the leg; Robyn Hope, a 75-year-old woman <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the shoulder; and Louisa Hope, her 52-year-old daughter, <b>who</b> was <b>shot</b> in the foot.All three were in a stable {{condition}} after treatment. Paolo Vassallo, {{one of the five}} hostages who initially escaped the scene, was hospitalised for a pre-existing condition. The other hostages were identified as John O'Brien, Stefan Balafoutis, Elly Chen, Jieun Bae, Harriette Denny, Viswakanth Ankireddy, Joel Herat, Fiona Ma, Jarrod Hoffman, Puspendu Ghosh, Selina Win Pe, and Julie Taylor.|$|R

5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel <b>who</b> <b>shot</b> supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
