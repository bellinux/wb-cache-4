25|$|One {{example of}} a quantum {{interference}} phenomenon that arises from superposition is the double-slit experiment. The photon state is a superposition of two different states, one of which corresponds to the photon having passed through the left slit, and the other corresponding to passage through the right slit. The relative phase of those two states has a value which depends on the distance {{from each of the}} two slits. Depending on what that phase is, the interference is constructive at some locations and destructive in others, creating the interference pattern. By the analogy <b>with</b> <b>coherence</b> in other wave phenomena, a superposed state can be referred to as a coherent superposition.|$|E

But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little position and connection in Limehouse Hole. Upon the smallest of small scales, she was an unlicensed pawnbroker, keeping what was popularly called a Leaving Shop, by lending insignificant sums on insignificant articles of property deposited with her as security. In her four-and-twentieth year of life, Pleasant was already in her fifth year of this way of trade. Her deceased mother had established the business, and on that parent's demise she had appropriated a secret capital of fifteen shillings to establishing herself in it; the existence of such capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential communication made to her by the departed, before succumbing to dropsical conditions of snuff and gin, incompatible equally <b>with</b> <b>coherence</b> and existence.|$|E

50|$|Monochromatic {{sources are}} usually lasers; such high monochromaticity implies long {{coherence}} lengths (up {{to hundreds of}} meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode helium-neon laser can easily produce light <b>with</b> <b>coherence</b> lengths of 300 m. Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, Δλ ≈ 2 nm - 70 nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50 nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600 nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.|$|E

50|$|Phase-sensitive {{coherent}} optical time-domain reflectometry (ϕ-OTDR) is {{a technique}} that can provide sufficient sensitivity and resolution for these distributed acoustic sensing systems. Standard optical time-domain reflectometry techniques use light sources <b>with</b> <b>coherence</b> lengths, which are shorter than pulse lengths. This can yield a sum of backscattered intensities from each scattering center, which allows monitoring splices and breaks in fiber optic cables. On the contrary, in ϕ-OTDR-based sensors, the coherence length of lasers is longer than their pulse length. An event near the fiber generates an acoustic wave that affects the optical fiber by changing the phases of the backscattering centers. An analysis of such signals can reveal {{their impact on the}} sensor and monitor located near fiber objects.|$|E

[...] However, the contemporary approach—one suggested as early as 1925 by Mary Parker Follett, the pioneer of community centers and author of influential works on management philosophy—is to integrate the informal organization and the formal organization, recognizing the strengths and limitations of each. Integration, as Follett defined it, means breaking down apparent sources of conflict into their basic elements and then building new solutions that neither allow domination nor require compromise. [...] In other words, integrating the informal organization with the formal organization replaces competition <b>with</b> <b>coherence.</b>|$|E
