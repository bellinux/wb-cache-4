40|$|B EFORE having driven {{many miles}} over the {{highways}} of east Texas, {{one is sure}} to pass the body of an odd looking animal, lying {{on the side of}} the highway. This victim of the speeding car is an armadillo, a quaint and reportedly archaic animal, but a newcomer to the United States, and one which is very likely someday to become one of the most common types of mammalian wild-life in the South. Some time ago one of the daily feature columns in a local Houston newspaper carried two articles on the armadillo. One of these was a scathing treatise on the evils of the little beast in the destruction of garden plants and in the damage to valuable shrubs. The other was an answer to the quely of some New England school boys who were seeking an armadiIlo, This column ended with a remark on this order: "'And <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> an armadillo?

40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> lower quality {{drinking}} water? The Safe Drinking Water Act allows an "affordability, variance technology, small system variance exemption" to {{the drinking}} water standards based on a supply side argument. It assumes small drinking water systems have significant diseconomies of scale in meeting the maximum contaminant levels. We can test this assumption by examining the cost of compliance technologies by system size developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to meet the mcl for arsenic. The data show that the least costly arsenic reduction technology to meet the current mcl of 10 parts per billion (ppb) is modify coagulation/filtration. This technology is also six to seven times more expensive to implement for very small systems (50 people or less) than for the small and medium size systems. At least for very small drinking water systems the arsenic case supports the assumption of diseconomies of small scale production. On the demand side, Albert Hirschman provides a theory {{that allows us to}} look at the tradeoff between the prices and the varieties of quality, e. g., mcl, for two types of consumers for a given quantity of drinking water. We describe the EPA affordability criterion. Then we analyze it in terms of changes in consumer surplus and economic rent from welfare theory. Finally we suggest an alternative criterion that we believe is more consistent with economic theory. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|In his Introduction to {{the history}} of science (1927 – 1948), George Sarton (1884 – 1956) {{reflected}} on his research habits and tools of trade over a long life as a bibliographer and historian. He made special mention of his books and as- sociated notes. This apparatus, as he called it, seemed “insignificant compared with the library, yet from my own point of view, it is the central thing, and the library but a gigantic annex to it”. 2 He was sure every scholar would appreciate this. My aim in this chapter is to examine Sarton’s claim in the light of some recent work in cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, before discuss- ing early modern European ideas about the relationships between memory, note-taking, and external repositories of information and knowledge. In this way, I confront the obvious question about the notion of a ‘forgetting machine’ – namely, given the well-known weakness and fragility of natural memory, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> one of these? By looking at the role of notebooks we can think about practices that allow one to forget and later retrieve, or recollect, what has been forgotten – either by consulting a stable record, such as a book or document, or by recollection from natural memory triggered by an external prompt, such as an image or note.

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{want to address}} more {{directly}} and extensively than previous studies why Bob Dylan chose his stage name. There are three contexts which allow us to arrive at an answer: the first, {{for which there is}} a good deal of evidence; the second, more speculative; and the third, evaluative. The article puts forward the proposition that Bob Dylan’s choice of surname was motivated by the pervasive mythology and enviable cultural capital of Dylan Thomas in the years after his death in 1953. The first question to be addressed is <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> adopt the name Dylan in the late 1950 s. Second, attention focuses on Robert Zimmerman in particular and asks why he, given the broader context of the Welshman’s cultural capital, decided to take Dylan Thomas’s Christian name as his surname. The third context is that of poetry and the influence Thomas had upon Bob Dylan’s work. I suggest that Robert Zimmerman’s choice was not because he was influenced by the poetry itself...|$|E

40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live {{anywhere}} close to the San Andreas fault? Yet millions choose to do precisely that and to all appearances lead reasonably normal lives. Perhaps the Baptist kingdom of our evangelical Zion is the San Andreas fault of Christendom. Given the constant rumbles, frequent tremors, and occasional ten point Richter scale seismic earth shifts, some observant evangeli-cals probably wonder why {{anyone would want to}} live among the rowdy Baptists. Others are curious as to why this phenomenon of confrontation in Baptist life seems to erupt with the regularity of “Old Faithful. ” One of the earliest tremors leading to the massive upheavals of the decade of the eighties was the publication of an article which appeared in various state Baptist papers in October of 1961 entitled Death In the Pot. K. Owen White, then the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Houston, Texas, and soon to be elected in 1963 as president of the Southern Baptist Convention, used the incident from the life of Elisha in 2 Kings 4 : 38 - 41 to suggest that a noxious herb had been introdu-ced into the Southern Baptist stew. His immediate target was the work of Ralph Elliott at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and the professor’s book The Message of Genesis published in 1961 by Broadman Press, the publishing arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Elliott's book had employed historical-critical assumptions, conclusions, and methodologies which led the professor to question the historicity of some of the narrative portions of Genesis.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and development of new nuclear programs are considered by many to be one of the biggest challenges facing the Obama administration. In addition to terrorist groups and organized crime networks, several governments have expressed interest in creating such programs and are increasingly working with existing nuclear networks. With all of the destruction nuclear weapons can cause <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> develop a nuclear program, knowing its dangerous effects? Indeed, there are multiple theories why countries would or would not want to pursue such a program. Nation states that have a desire to develop nuclear weapons require certain materials, technologies, and intellectual expertise which are most easily acquired from other countries. This study examines the case of Venezuela and whether or not that country is capable of joining the nuclear club. A 2009 bilateral trade agreement between Iran and Venezuela showed this country’s recognition of Iran’s legitimate right to its nuclear program and that Venezuela supports Iran’s right to peaceful nuclear technology. Can Venezuela garner sufficient support from Iran and countries such as Russia, North Korea and China to develop its own program? Who will lead Venezuela’s nuclear program and what should the U. S. response be? This case study will attempt to answer these and many other questions by using a social network analysis (SNA) methodology using publically available information to analyze Venezuela’s interactions with other nuclear capable countries towards the development of indications and warnings. It also will examine the formal and informal networks within the Venezuelan government, to determine central figures in charge of a potential nuclear program, and identify potential external Venezuelan partners. The final study will be available to US Government Personnel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use {{antitrust}} {{law as a}} wealth distribution device when far more explicit statutory tools are available for that purpose? One feature of antitrust is its open-textured, nonspecific statutes that are interpreted by judges. As a result, using antitrust to redistribute wealth may {{be a way of}} invoking the judicial process without having to go to Congress or a state legislature that is likely to be unsympathetic. Of course, a corollary is that someone attempting to use {{antitrust law}} to redistribute wealth will have to rely on the existing antitrust statutes rather than obtaining a new antitrust provision that is more explicitly distributive. One possible lever for redistributive antitrust is a link between market competitiveness and wealth equality. A good deal of literature suggests that competitive markets are conducive to the more even distribution of wealth. Of course, the antitrust laws already have an agreed upon goal of making markets more competitive. The most defensible goal for the antitrust laws is prohibition of practices that serve to reduce output anticompetitively, which is simply a statement of the consumer welfare principle. The arguments for an antitrust consumer welfare approach are of three general kinds – those derived from legislative history, those derived from principle, and those derived from administrative concerns. The legislative history makes a weak case for consumer welfare, but as between consumer welfare and general welfare the former is a clear winner. Second, arguments from principle do not get us anywhere because they are very sensitive to assumptions. Third, the arguments from administrability strongly favor a consumer welfare approach. That then leaves one question pertaining to wealth inequality. Suppose we start out with the premise that antitrust harm consists in a market-power-driven output reduction. Accepting that competitive markets are conducive to greater wealth equality, hasn’t antitrust already done all it can do? To ask that question differently, are there any circumstances in which antitrust should favor practices that reduce output simply because these practices also yield a more appealing distribution of wealth...|$|E
