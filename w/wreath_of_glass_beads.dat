40|$|The archaeological record {{witnesses}} {{the presence}} <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in early Iron Age Taiwan {{and the potential}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> beadmaking on the southeastern coast. Previous research has proposed that the appearance <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in Taiwan is {{in association with the}} South China Sea exchange network, and this particular material culture replaced the indigenous nephrite in local societies in Taiwan. Therefore, this research studies <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from 7 Iron Age sites (Kiwulan, Jiuxianglan, Guishan, Daoye, Wujiancuo, Shisanhang and Xiliao) in Taiwan in an attempt to understand the provenance and hence exchange, consumption and production <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in the 1 st millennium AD in Taiwan and the interaction shown by these specific goods with the South China Sea network. Beads from around the island, from Kiwulan, Jiuxianglan, Guishan, Daoye and Wujiancuo are analysed data in this research, and this is supplemented with data from Shisanhang and Xiliao from published reports. The evidence <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> beadmaking from Jiuxianglan is also investigated. The material covers a wide geographic region including northern, northeastern, southeastern, southern and southwestern Taiwan, and spans the 1 st millennium AD. To elucidate the research questions, the methodology chosen combines the typological study, compositional analysis (to trace elemental level), microstructural investigation and archaeological context <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from each site. This research proposes regional and chronological patterns in terms of the typology and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in early Iron Age Taiwan, which suggests primarily a Southeast Asian source of early Iron Age <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in Taiwan and later a transition to a Chinese origin during the turn of the 2 nd millennium AD. The results also indicate the presence of a regional exchange network within Taiwan, particularly within northern and northeastern Taiwan, which {{may be related to the}} socio-political interaction between societies. It is also found that the mortuary contexts <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from different sites shows different degrees of social differentiation between the broad eastern and southwestern Taiwan. In addition, this research reveals a paradox between the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and <b>glass</b> waste from Jiuxianglan, which does not suggest the local production of finished beads at this site. The findings also do not indicate the exchange <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> made at Jiuxianglan to other contemporary sites in Taiwan. In addition, the production <b>of</b> m-Na-Al <b>glass</b> and v-Na-Ca glass and their movement within the broad South China Sea network suggests the possibility of shared knowledge but less standardised process <b>of</b> m-Na-Al <b>glass</b> production <b>of</b> the <b>beads</b> found in Taiwan, and a different tradition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> colouring between m-Na-Al glass and v-Na-Ca glasses which may be related to different provenances...|$|R

40|$|Based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM), a damage {{model for}} glass-bead-filled {{modified}} polyphenylene oxide (GB/PPO) {{has been proposed}} to describe its damage behavior at various levels of tensile strain by considering the reduction of effective loading area. Hence, an equation for prediction of effective elastic modulus of the damaged GB/PPO composites {{in terms of the}} three principal true strains was derived. The tensile properties and damage behaviors of the GB/PPO composites with different volume percentages <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were investigated using standard tensile tests and load-unload tests, respectively. The addition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> increases Young's modulus of PPO but has a weakening effect on its tensile strength. A maximum value of tensile work to break and tensile strain at break was found when 5 vol% <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with a mean diameter of 11 mu m was blended with PPO. These results were justified through microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In-situ observations of the strain damage processes were made through the SEM equipped with a tensile stage to determine the strain at fully debonding <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> The volumetric strain of GB/PPO composites increases because of micro-cavitation during strain damage. In general, the prediction for the effective elastic modulus of the damaged GB/PPO composites at different true strains is slightly higher than the experimental results. The damage evolution rates after fully debonding <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from the matrix are close to those predicted by the proposed damage model...|$|R

A time-sequence study of the emergence of epicotyls through 90 mm <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> showed that an accelerated evolution of ethylene preceded a reduction in elongation. As the epicotyls elongated through the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> medium and less resistance was encountered, evolution of ethylene declined and rapid elongation was resumed.

40|$|Pavement {{markings}} {{are vital}} for safely navigating roadways. The nighttime visibility of pavement markings {{is enhanced by}} addition <b>of</b> retroreflective <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> most <b>of</b> which are made from recycled glass. Concern has been raised over the presence of heavy metals in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used in pavement markings and their effect on human and environmental health. Based upon the potential risk associated {{with the presence of}} arsenic and lead in the <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> two Bills are currently being considered before the 112 th Congress of the United States of America seeking to set a maximum permissible limit for the amount of arsenic and lead in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used within pavement marking systems on domestic roadways. This study was designed to support legislative decision making by providing data necessary for risk assessment. The experiments carried out provide: an analysis <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> metal content and extractability; an evaluation of the relationship between arsenic content <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and their retroreflective performance; an evaluation of analytical methods used to measure the total bead metal content; and an analysis <b>of</b> samples <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> and soil mixture from a <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> storage site used to determine site-specific metal concentrations in the soil media. Mean arsenic content, measured using the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's KOH fusion digestion, in all the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> examined ranged from 11 ppm to 82 ppm, while mean lead content, measured using KOH fusion digestion, ranged from below quantification limit to 199 ppm. Total metal content measurements indicated a high amount of variability in the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> samples; most likely associated with the use <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> feed during manufacturing. The relationship between the retroreflective performance and the arsenic content <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> was analyzed and a weak but positive correlation was observed between the two factors. However, a more detailed study is required to evaluate the relationship between arsenic content and retroreflectivity.

40|$|Hitherto, the {{majority}} of studies which have included the discussion <b>of</b> Viking <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> have mainly focused on the assemblages from individual sites, with limited use of known parallels. Exceptions to this include recent publications regarding the Icelandic material and Callmer’s 1977 catalogue of the finds from mainland Scandinavia, now over thirty years old. Analysis of these finds from Ireland was, for the most part, non-existent. The aim {{of this research is}} to address this lack of analysis within Ireland, while incorporating the wider context of the beads within the Viking North Atlantic. The research thus examines the use <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> diagnostically Scandinavian manufacture and import found in Ireland, particularly in relation to their context and distribution. The history of research from Ireland as well as from across the Viking world is considered and explored throughout the thesis, with critique of methods and discussions used. Focussed analysis of both published and unpublished material detailing artefacts from Scandinavia (especially Vestfold), Britain, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and L’Anse aux Meadows is presented within the thesis in order to provide the greater picture for the core section of the thesis, the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> found in Ireland.
