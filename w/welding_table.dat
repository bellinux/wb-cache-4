40|$|Very less {{work has}} been done on laser welding of polymer materials. This project related to the {{optimization}} of process parameters in laser welding operations. Larger pieces of Polycarbonates were cut into small pieces. The dimension of small pieces is 80 mm × 50 mm × 2 mm were cut from larger pieces. Good surface finish required for laser welding. So the small pieces must not have a gap when it is placed nearly between one another. The small pieces were machined by bend saw machine. Very less burr can also affect the welding output. The small pieces were welded on the <b>welding</b> <b>table.</b> Experimental design using the Taguchi method. Based on the Taguchi method, the number of experiments can be reduced from the total actual experiment. For the analysis, tensile test and microstructural tests were performed on each specimen. This analysis is also based on the Taguchi method calculation. Finally, the optimum parameters for the tensile test and bubble size have been predicted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Resistance {{spot welding}} {{is a process}} which is widely used in the {{automotive}} industry to join steel parts of various thicknesses and types. The current practice in the automotive industry in determining the welding schedule which {{will be used in}} the welding process is based on <b>welding</b> <b>table</b> or experiences. This however may not be the optimum welding schedule that will give the best spot weld quality. This work concentrates on the parameter optimization when spot welding steels with dissimilar thickness and type using Grey Based Taguchi Method. The experimentation in this work used a L 9 orthogonal array with three factors with each factor having three levels. The three factors used are welding current weld time and electrode force. The three weld characteristics that were optimized are weld strength weld nugget diameter and weld indentation. The analysis of variance ANOVA that was carried out showed that welding current gave the most significant contribution in the optimum welding schedule. The comparison test that was carried out to compare the current welding schedule and the optimum welding schedule showed distinct improvement in the increase of weld diameter and weld strengthas well as decrease in electrode indentation...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{objects in}} a web-based {{environment}} can be interfaced to {{and controlled by}} external real world controllers. A Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) welding cell was created that models a robotic arc welding cell (the Automated Welding Manufacturing System project,) located at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The VRML welding cell contains {{a model of a}} 7 degree-of-freedom robot, a <b>welding</b> <b>table,</b> torch and various fixtures and parts. The VRML robot is interfaced to, and can be controlled by, the real world robot controller. This is accomplished by a socket connection between the collaborator's web browser and the real world controller. The current joint angles of the robot, which are stored in a world model buffer in the controller, are collected by a Java applet running on the web page. The applet updates the VRML model of the robot via the External Authoring Interface (EAI) of the VRML plug-in. Virtual welds, a series of VRML cylinders, are also dynamically created every 100 ms on the part based on the current robot position and colored according to the calculated weld quality of that section of weld obtained from the real world controller. This allows a collaborator to visually determine where a bad section of weld has occurred without being present in the physical welding lab...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem that}} we worked with our client to solve focuses on the {{production}} of modular <b>weld</b> <b>tables.</b> The design for the <b>weld</b> <b>table</b> was already completed {{at the time we}} took on our project. The problem was that assembly of the table took far too long to be feasible for a production run of multiple units. Lack of proper fixturing would also lead to variance in the tolerances of each unit produced...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} {{used on the}} external tank (ET) portion of the Space Shuttle Program which employs fracture control to establish defect acceptance criteria in a welding specification is discussed. Weld acceptance criteria developed for the ET fabricated from 2219 aluminum are demonstrated using as an example one of the actual ET <b>welds.</b> A <b>table</b> of <b>weld</b> grades {{as a function of}} acceptable defect length is presented. The design drawing specifies the weld grade for a particular weld; then the inspector uses the grade to determine the defect length for radiographic and penetrant acceptance of the weld. By allowing each weld to be judged by its own defect requirement instead of using the tightest requirement, the number of weld repairs has been minimized, resulting in lower cost with no compromise in performance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the metal transfer. The main goal of the investigation was to check that using narrow band filter and high speed digital video camera can be used, without a back-lighting laser, to observe the metal transfer process. Presented are the influence of wire feed rate (welding current) on droplet diameter, droplet trajectory and velocity. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were carried out on an automated <b>welding</b> <b>table.</b> A high speed video camera “Olympus i-SPEED” was used. For each welding wire feed speed the image of metal transfer and welding parameters (welding current, arc voltage and wire feed rate) were recorded. Findings: Results presented in this paper indicate that the wire feed has a significant influence on droplet diameter, droplet trajectory and droplet velocity. That method based on digital high speed camera and narrow band filter is very sensitive to the changes of welding conditions and should be used as a tool for monitoring of the GMAW process. Research limitations/implications: The high speed video camera is an expensive instrument and it can be used only as a laboratory tool in monitoring and optimizing of welding processes. Practical implications: The achieved experience allows directing further research on the metal transfer in GMAW and studying the possibilities of using this method in other welding processes. Originality/value: The new method for monitoring metal transfer based on narrow band filter and high speed digital camera does not require He-Ne laser to provide the back-lighting in order to observe the metal transfer process. This method is cheaper and easier to use. The original results of these investigations are mathematic descriptions of droplet flight trajectory and droplet velocity...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the things}} we use in our daily life is welded or made by {{equipment}} that is welded. Welders build products from coffeepots to automobiles, from bridges to skyscrapers and millions of other products which are produced for the use of people. Because of welding technology is widely used, especially in the manufacturing and services industries, therefore most of technical institutions and higher learning institutions that offer technical and engineering courses will include welding technology {{as a part of the}} curriculums. From the educational perspective, welding technology is one of the foremost skills that have to be mastered by students who are going to involve in the area of engineering as well as technical education. But yet, learning the welding skill is not easy for students. For teachers, teaching students to master the skills is even tougher. Therefore, the main purpose of this product-based research is to design and produce a multi-position <b>welding</b> <b>table</b> which is able to help students to weld in various positions such as flat, overhead, vertical and horizontal positions. Apart from that, this product also can be used as a work piece holder for welding circular work pieces such as cylinder, rod, tube and pipe. The Crawford’s six-stage product development model will be used as a guideline in this research. The final product will be assessed in terms of user friendliness as well as the effectiveness of the product in teaching and learning process. It is expected that the use of the multi-position table will be able to smoothen the teaching and learning process, where students can use it to master the gas and arc welding skills easily and teachers can use it to demonstrate the welding technique effectively...|$|E
40|$|In this work, it was {{determined}} that with increasing weld pitch, the occurrence of a 2 ̆ 01 clazy S 2 ̆ 01 d defect in the weld nugget of friction stir welded (FSWed) AA 6061 became increasingly pronounced, though its impact on the bend performance of the weld was negligible. For a fixed weld pitch of 0. 48, the effect of gap, i. e. the spacing between two sheets at the butt joint interface, on the joint quality of AA 6061 was evaluated in terms of the welding defects, microstructure, hardness and bend performance. Fully penetrated welds without metallurgical defects such as wormholes were obtained up to a joint gap of 0. 5 mm. Though the overall microhardness and bend performance of the welds remained unaffected until a joint gap of 0. 8 mm, the decrease in the forge force during FSW beyond a joint gap value of 0. 5 mm may represent a more critical limit in regards to the industrial application of the process; this is especially important when applying force control during processing to ensure a constant shoulder penetration in the material for addressing practical considerations, such as thickness variations in the assembly, clamping distortions and tool wear. Based on these results and using force amplitudes recorded during the welding experiments, a robotic scenario was synthesized with an appropriate operational window for continuous-path friction stir butt welding (FSBW) of 3. 18 -mm-thick sheets clamped to a 1 m 7 1 m horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>table.</b> An appropriate industrial robot model was selected and the associated geometric workcell layout was developed for this application. This scenario was implemented in a physical prototype and used to successfully produce 1 -m-long FSWed assemblies that exhibited good tensile mechanical performance.
