5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

50|$|The China Bar and Alexandra tunnels have <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> {{that are}} {{activated}} by cyclists before {{they enter the}} tunnels. This was required because the tunnels are curved. It is expected that the Ferrabee tunnel will get the same <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> as it too is curved.|$|R
25|$|That civil {{aircraft}} involved in low-flying activities should be painted as conspicuously {{as possible and}} fitted with high power collision <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> preferably strobe type. Also recommended that the military consider fitment of strobe type high power collision <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> to aircraft engaged in low level training.|$|R
25|$|An orange <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> {{then went}} on to warn the crew that an {{overheating}} had occurred on the left wing (as the fire had spread through the left wing). Before the crew initiated the checklist to handle the emergency, the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> suddenly went off. They thought that the warning had ended. However, this was wrong. The ceasing of the warning was caused by the fire in the wheel wells; the fire had destroyed the warning system's electrical circuit.|$|E
25|$|If a fault {{develops}} in {{any part of}} the ABS, a <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> will usually be illuminated on the vehicle instrument panel, and the ABS will be disabled until the fault is rectified.|$|E

25|$|The Australian {{delivered}} U13 Bluebird {{was released}} in late 1993 and terminated in 1997. Series 1 ran from 1993 until 1995 while Series 2 ran from 1995 to 1997. Series 2 saw {{the addition of a}} driver's airbag, revised grille styling, and a seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> The Series 1 LX model came equipped with cruise control standard but strangely it was an option on the Series 2.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 30 {{seconds after}} Flight 420's request to return, control {{problems}} started to occur. The aircraft became harder {{to control and}} a warning indicator showed that an engine problem was developing. 40 seconds later, the wing overheat warning system was illuminated. Before the crew had conducted the checklist for handling such an emergency, the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> went off. 5 minutes later the left engine appeared to be on fire. The crew later shut down the engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{brake pads}} must usually be {{replaced}} regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), {{and some are}} equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.|$|E

25|$|The Bel Air, {{which had}} been the top line series since 1953, was now the middle range. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers {{matching}} the car series. Parkwood 6-passenger and Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. Under the hood, little change took place. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. Bel Air production was 447,100. The new Impala line surpassed Bel Air production by 20,000 units. A parking brake <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> was optional.|$|E
25|$|The North American cars {{also had}} {{different}} equipment levels (depending on the version: Milano Silver, Milano Gold or Milano Platinum). L/h and r/h electrically adjustable outside mirrors, electrically reclining seats and cruise control were usually optional in Europe. The car was also available with a 3-speed ZF automatic gearbox {{option for the}} 2.5 V6. Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, oil pressure in psi and coolant temperature in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including a seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E

25|$|The {{stall warning}} and stall {{recovery}} systems {{were at the}} centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure valve (part of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway. A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E
500|$|On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a {{practice}} emergency descent, the bomb bay fire <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> The captain shut the engine {{down and the}} AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed Ram air turbine (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped at around [...] After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT's electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent fuel pipe and setting the fuel on fire.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuel system}} {{comprised}} two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) anhedral wing {{section of the}} port and starboard wings, each with [...] capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the power plant. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of [...] was positioned under the engine.|$|E
50|$|R.E. Dietz also {{produced}} {{the majority of}} road work <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b> First oil lanterns (Traffic-Gard trademark) and road torches which looked like cannonballs with large wicks. Kerosene was normally used in these lamps. Later they developed {{some of the first}} transistorized <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> (Visi-Flash trademark) using standard 6v lantern batteries. These lights either blinked in timed intervals or had a steady light.|$|R

500|$|By {{the time}} Mission Control issued the {{wake-up call to}} the crew for flight day two, the {{spacecraft}} was about [...] away from the Earth, traveling at about [...] As it was not due to arrive in lunar orbit until flight day four, flight days two and three were largely preparatory days, consisting of spacecraft maintenance and scientific research. On day two, the crew performed an electrophoresis experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which they attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module {{for the second time}} in the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite this, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn. Command Module Pilot Mattingly reported a [...] "gimbal lock" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> indicating the craft was not reporting an attitude. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon. At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about [...] away from Earth.|$|E
