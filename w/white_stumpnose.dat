40|$|Conventional {{fisheries}} management approaches have been shown, in many instances, {{to have been}} ineffective in dealing with complex conservation concerns such as bycatch. Greater considerations for broader-scale and holistic approaches, as proposed by the 'Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries' (EAF) and the 'balanced harvesting approach', are beginning to challenge some of the negative misconceptions around bycatch, especially in small-scale fisheries. The need for a more holistic approach to {{fisheries management}}, particularly in small-scale fisheries, in South Africa is highlighted by its commitment to an EAF and the recent Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, for which the Marine living Resource Act of 1998 provides the legal framework to implement. The case study of the Olifants estuary small-scale traditional gillnet fishing community, located {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, provides a particularly relevant example of a complex fishery requiring a holistic approach. Current regulations prohibit the harvesting or retention of any bycatch species. Fisheries management worldwide and in South Africa, generally view gillnet fisheries as destructive, due to the occurrence of bycatch and {{the fact that many of}} these bycatch species are considered overexploited, which has led to numerous attempts over the years to phase out the Olifants gillnet fishery. The purpose of this study was to, firstly, use an EAF framework to contextualise the issue of bycatch in the Olifants gillnet fishery, and secondly, to identify the relative contributions of all fisheriy sectors to the four key selected linefish species caught as bycatch by the fishery. An extensive review and analysis of available secondary data, as well as primary data collected for this study, have estimated, with acknowledged limitations, the magnitude of the exploitation by all known fisheries of these species. Key information from small-scale fisher interviews and community-monitoring data highlight the capture rate of key linefish species by this fishery. This is echoed by recent landings for 2012 indicating the relative contribution of the national beache seine and gillnet fishery to the overall catch of (Elf [Pomatomus saltatrix] - 26. 94 %; Silver Kob [Argyrosomus inodorus] - 0. 88 %; <b>White</b> <b>Stumpnose</b> [Rhabdosargus globiceps] - 1. 05 % - excluding the recreational sector). A significant finding of this study is the substantial levels of cross-sectorial exploitation of Silver Kob and <b>White</b> <b>Stumpnose,</b> and to a somewhat lesser extent Elf and White Steenbras...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Sustainable {{diversification}} and {{the biological}} viability of selected aquaculture species are now {{viewed as being}} crucial factors that must be assessed in order to introduce the candidate species into commercial production. The biological feasibility of <b>white</b> <b>stumpnose,</b> Rhabdosargus globiceps,as a potential aquaculture candidate, was assessed by examining {{the ability of the}} broodstock to be manipulated to spawn in captivity and the viability of the larvae from 0 days post hatch (DPH) to 30 DPH under varied conditions. These factors are recognised as the most significant bottlenecks of development for a potential aquaculture candidate. A compressed photothermal cycle successfully brought about the reproductive maturation of both male and female broodstock. The natural, seasonal reproduction cycle, of the population of Rhabdosargus globiceps in Langebaan Lagoon, and manipulated cycles were comparable with regard to oocyte maturation. Under the compressed cycle an increase in the plasma estradiol 17 ß concentration correlated with the increase in oocyte diameter and the presence of late vitellogenic and hydrated oocytes. Reproductively mature broodstock were injected twice with LH-RHa on a 24 hour interval, which successfully induced spawning over four consecutive 24 hour periods. This method of manipulation and induction of spawning was successful twice and the resultant eggs and larvae were used to examine the ontogeny and the optimal rearing temperature of Rhabdosargus globiceps. In the first larval rearing experiment the stages of development from egg to 30 DPH larvae were recorded at 20 °C and showed similar developmental stages as other sea bream aquaculture species. The developmental stages were noted as being highly influenced by the available food sources with elevated mortalities recorded during the transitional phase between endogenous food reserves and exogenous feeding. The growth pattern showed the same reduced growth present for other successfully cultured sea bream larvae, suggesting that first feeding and swimbladder inflation was relatively successful. At 30 DPH the larvae reached a mean total length of 11. 14 ± 0. 44 mm. To determine the optimal rearing temperature and the effect of temperature on embryonic development eggs were placed at three different incubation temperatures (25 °C, 20 °C and 15 °C) and the timing to the developmental stages was recorded from 0 DPH to 30 DPH. Measurements indicated that the larvae reached and exceeded their thermal tolerance at 25 °C, with larvae only surviving to 6 DPH at this temperature, while at 20 °C the larvae had better growth, and significantly earlier indications and higher percentages of feeding, swimbladder inflation and notochord flexion than at 15 °C. The results suggest that the highest quality larvae are achieved at a rearing temperature of 20 °C. This thesis describes the induction of spawning and larval rearing of Rhabdosargus globiceps. The ontogeny of the larvae as well as the critical stages of first feeding, swimbladder inflation and notochord flexion are discussed and described in detail. Overall, the life cycle from adult to juvenile was successfully closed and the experiments showed very positive results regarding Rhabdosargus globiceps’ biological capacity and feasibility to become a potential aquaculture candidate in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{interpretation}} of recent variability observed in fish populations, species compositions, distribution ranges or ecological indicators, depends on {{knowledge of their}} past dynamics and historical states. The onset of systematic fisheries data collection typically lagged decades or even centuries behind modern fishing exploits. As a consequence, pre-disturbed reference points and descriptions of subsequent change are rarely available. A remarkably detailed set of historical trawl survey data from South Africa provided such a rare opportunity. Government-funded exploration of the Agulhas Bank fishery potential resulted in meticulously-documented trawl survey data from 1897 - 1904, when prior human impacts on those resources were negligible. Although they used less effective technology, the information recorded and methods used were similar to modern surveys. This thesis investigated change in demersal fish fauna of the Agulhas Bank and documents comparisons between historical trawl surveys and modern re-enactments at the same locations. In comparing trawl survey catches over multiple decades or among different periods, unquantified changes in fishing power pose a key challenge. The shape, size, materials, mesh sizes and speed at which trawl nets are dragged, interact with the behaviour, {{size and shape of}} fish, influencing fishing performance. To accurately compare current catch rates with those of historical trawl surveys, the same trawl gear and methods were carefully replicated in repeat surveys at three sites. An investigation of literature and photographs of the original vessel and equipment were conducted to support the construction of a replica 'Granton' otter trawl net. The net was composed of Manila hemp with a headline length of 27 m (90 ft) and was attached to flat wooden trawl boards. The historical towing speed was estimated as 1. 34 m s⁻¹ (2. 6 knots). Three parts of the shallow Agulhas Bank that were surveyed 111 years prior, were re-surveyed in 2015. Species composition was contrasted between the historical and re-survey periods by way of unconstrained ordination, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and tests of the homogeneity of multivariate group dispersions. Taxa discerning between periods were identified with similarity percentage analyses. Changes of standardised catch between periods were tested for 27 taxa, using a non-parametric bootstrap approach. Proportions among size-classes, recorded for three taxa, were tested using Fisher's exact test. Results revealed a substantially transformed demersal catch assemblage, where the period effect explained almost half of the measured variance among samples. These changes included the disappearance or heavy depletion of kob (Argyrosomus spp., absent in re-surveys), panga (Pterogymnus laniarius; 2. 4 % of historical catch abundance) and east coast sole (Austroglossus pectoralis; 4. 6 % of historical catch abundance), which had jointly contributed 70 - 84 % of historical catch composition. Average re-survey catches were largely made up of gurnards (Chelidonichthys spp.; 3 792 % of historical abundance), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus; 4 738 % of historical abundance), spiny dogfish (Squalus spp.; 3 121 % of historical abundance), hake (Merluccius capensis; 558 % of historical abundance) and white sea catfish (Galeichthys feliceps; 13 863 % of historical abundance). Analysis of available length information confirmed the expectation that fish sizes (specifically M. capensis and A. pectoralis) had declined. This implies that comparisons by weight would be more severe for declined abundances and less severe for those that increased, relative to contrasts of numerical abundance. Habitat preferences as well as geographic and depth distribution appeared to separate the taxa that increased from those that declined. These factors, together with reproductive and growth characteristics, as well as indirect trophic impacts, likely shaped the responses of demersal fauna to fishing and other human impacts during the 111 years between trawl surveys. An assessment of distribution changes of 44 common demersal taxa was undertaken. These analyses were restricted to the last 30 years of trawl survey data as the units and spatio-temporal resolution of prior data were incompatible. Standardised catches were used from annual spring and autumn south coast trawl surveys conducted by the government fisheries department. Geostatistical delta-generalised linear mixed models were used to predict species distribution functions, which were used to calculate annual estimates of latitude/longitude centres of gravity and effective areas occupied by each population. Average trends over the study period (1986 - 2016) were assessed using a Bayesian state-space model. Of nine species found to have a trend in average location, six moved westward or south-westward, while three moved eastward or north-eastward. Two species showed a trend of contracting spatial extent and one showed an expansion. Across the entire assemblage combined, there was a significant contraction in extent and a westward shift in average location. These assemblage-wide average trends are interpreted to be driven by climate forcing. Fishing impacts are expected to have contributed to the eastward movement in centre of gravity for kob, lesser sandshark (Rhinobatos annulatus) and <b>white</b> <b>stumpnose</b> (Rhabdosargus globiceps). Interpretation of these distribution shifts is hampered by a lack of knowledge on subsurface hydrographic trends on the Agulhas Bank, which is identified as a research priority. My research revealed substantial change in demersal fish communities on South Africa's Agulhas Bank and adds novel insight to the history underlying current states of demersal ecosystems. Valuable additions include a) documentation {{of the extent to which}} demersal assemblages have transformed during the last century at three representative inshore sites; b) estimates of current abundances relative to pre-disturbed baselines at those sites, which c) highlights drastic local depletion for certain taxa and d) reveals substantial abundance increases of certain species during the post-industrial fishing period; e) novel evidence of distribution trends in south coast demersal species; and f) identification of trends in the average distribution of the demersal fish assemblage, suspected to be climate-forced. Long-term comparisons, using minimally-disturbed baselines, revealed drastic transformation of the fish assemblage during a century of industrialisation, which points to trawling-induced alteration of benthic habitats and substantial changes in ecosystem structure. Besides the provision of novel historical context for current and future studies and decision-making, this work counters the erosive nature of shifting baselines in South Africa's marine environment...|$|E
