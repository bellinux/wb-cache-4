50|$|Evidence of the {{capacity}} for invertebrates to experience nociception and pain has been widely studied in crustaceans. In the crab Neohelice granulata, electric shocks delivered via small holes in the carapace elicited a defensive threat display. Injection of morphine reduced the crabs' sensitivity to the shock in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect declining with increasing duration between morphine injection and shock. Naloxone injection inhibited the effects of morphine, as is seen in vertebrates. Morphine also had inhibitory effects on the escape tail-flick response to electric shock in the mantis shrimp, Squilla mantis, that was reversed by naloxone, indicating that the effect is found in crustacean groups other than decapods. When the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide were applied to the antennae of grass prawns, Penaeus monodon, {{there was an increase}} in rubbing and grooming of the treated areas which was not seen if they had previously been treated with a local anaesthetic, benzocaine, however, the benzocaine did not eliminate the level of rubbing seen in response to mechanical stimulation with forceps. There was no effect of benzocaine on the general locomotion of the prawns, so the reduction in rubbing and grooming was not simply due to inactivity of the animal.

40|$|<b>Whiteleg</b> shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei {{is one of}} {{the most}} commercially farmed species {{worldwide}} because of its fast growth, good survival rate at high farming densities, and osmoregulatory capacity, which makes it an excellent candidate for cultures at different salinities. The knowledge of shrimp nutritional requirements is critical in the formulation of diets to allow optimal growth at different environmental conditions and development stages. The effect of salinity on apparent digestibility of shrimp feed is not well known, and this information is required in shrimp diet formulation. For this purpose, the apparent digestibility coefficients of carbohydrates (ACD) and lipids (ALD) were determined for juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> shrimps under controlled culture conditions. We evaluated the apparent digestibility of six commercial (D 1 : 37 CP, D 2 : 38 CP, D 3 : 39 CP, D 4 : 34 CP, D 5 : 35 CP, and D 6 : 37 CP) and two experimental (E 1 : 33 CP and E 2 : 33 CP) diets for juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp cultivated at three salinities (5, 35 and 50 psu) in 60 L aquariums. ACD and ALD were determined in vivo using chromic oxide as an inert marker. Our results showed that ALD in most cases was over 80 %, independent of salinity, except the E 1 : 33 CPdiet which had 74. 0 % at 50 psu. Diet D 3 : 39 CP showed the highest ALD coefficient (90. 1 and 90. 6 % at 5 and 35 psu, respectively).

30|$|Haemolymph {{metabolites}} in crustaceans {{represent the}} physiological, nutritional and immunological stress indicators (Becerra-Dorame et al. 2012). In this study, plasma protein was higher in lower substitute level of SBM which means high FM containing diet resulted in high total protein content in haemolymph of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp {{and this was}} according to the results obtained by Rosas et al.

In other studies, same decreasing trend of cholesterol was found in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Kaushik et al. 1995) and gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata (Venou et al. 2006) due to inclusion of SBM in the diet.

40|$|Aquaculture {{provides}} our rising {{global population}} {{a multitude of}} social, economic, and ecological benefits. A large component of the yields is <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), which has expanded to over three million tons annual global production. As <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp tolerate {{a wide range of}} salinities, a potential method to reduce impacts is freshwater inland culture, which would decrease operational and environmental costs. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such a proposal via a long-term analysis of shrimp growth and survival in freshwater, compared to brackish or saltwater (0, 12, and 35 ppt, respectively) over a 107 day period. Based on findings of previous studies, I hypothesized equal shrimp growth and survival among treatments. Growth, survival, and biomass results in freshwater were poor compared to higher salinities (0. 063 g/wk compared to 0. 62 and 0. 091 g/wk growth, 1 % versus 63 and 72 % survival, and 2 g versus 307 and 1747 g final biomass, respectively). This study confirmed that many factors are vital to the successful culture of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp. Multiple regression demonstrated that water quality variables (salinity, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH) were significantly correlated with dependent variables (shrimp growth, survival, and biomass) to varying degrees. Growth was negatively associated with salinity and pH, and positively associated with alkalinity and DO. Survival was positively associated with alkalinity and pH, and negatively with ammonia, while biomass had a significant positive association with DO. Growth was the sole dependent variable with a significant association with salinity. Growing shrimp was most effective in brackish water under the conditions of the present experiment, but continued research on identifying drivers of this limitation are worthwhile in order to make the valuable shrimp farming industry as sustainable as possible...|$|E
30|$|Almost all {{filamentous}} green seaweeds {{currently used}} for growth enhancement of aquaculture species as raw or dried dietary feed {{are from the}} genus Ulva; species used for this application include U. clathrata for <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp, (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011), U. intestinalis for <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp (Limsuwan et al. 2008), U. intestinalis for spotted scat, red tilapia, and giant gourami (Siddik and Anh 2015), U. rigida for Nile tilapia (Ergün et al. 2009), and Ulva sp. for Nile tilapia (Siddik et al. 2014). The frequent use of Ulva spp. {{may be due to}} their euryhalinity and eurythermy (Msuya and Neori 2002; Kakinuma et al. 2004; McAvoy and Klug 2005; Tsutsui et al. 2012), which facilitates their application to variable aquaculture environments {{with a wide range of}} salinities, and to their widespread availability. The Chaetomorpha sp. investigated in this study has a wider salinity tolerance range than Ulva species; Chaetomorpha sp. can grow in salinities of 0.2 – 80 PSU and has a high growth rate maximum of < 60  % day− 1 (Tsutsui et al. 2015).

30|$|Trypsin is a {{protease}} {{enzyme that}} is excreted by the pancreas and plays a great {{role in the}} digestion of proteins (Erlanger et al. 1961). The {{results of the present}} study showed that the 100 % replacement level of FM, with no regard to the inclusion of amino acids, had negative effects on the activity of trypsin. This might be related to the trypsin inhibitory properties of SBM (Francis et al. 2001). There are several natural trypsin inhibitors, also known as serine protease inhibitors, and SBM is one of the most important ones. SBM controls the activation and catabolism of proteins by the inhibition of serine proteases (Silverman et al. 2001). Thus, at 100 % replacement level, SBM will act as trypsin inhibitor for juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp. Previously, it was shown that biofloc contain several extracellular enzymes such as protease and amylase (Yu et al. 2009). The extracellular enzymes that are synthesized by the microorganisms attached to the biofloc would release to the digestive tract of the host organism after being ingested. These enzymes would take part along with the total enzymes activities of the body. In addition, the bioactive compounds present in the biofloc may possibly improve digestive enzyme activities of the shrimp (Xu et al. 2012). Observation with the trypsin activity suggested an improved efficiency of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp to digest SBM diet reared in biofloc system as compared to those shrimp reared in clear water fed diets with 100 % FM. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that functions by removing damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the cell. The mechanism is by catalyzing the segregation of the superoxide (O 2 −) radicals to ordinary molecules such as oxygen or hydrogen peroxide (Fattman et al. 2003; Lin et al. 2010). In the present study, SOD activity was reduced when the FM substitution level exceeded 33 % of diet. The results of this study demonstrated that shrimp fed diets with up to 33 % replacement level were in better physiological and health condition compared to higher inclusion rates. In conclusion, this study showed that up to 33 % FM in the diets of juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp reared in biofloc system could be replaced by SBM with or without supplementation of methionine and lysine.|$|E

Several nutritionists have investigated the feasibility of SBM in aquafeeds, {{and the results are}} contradictory, because the levels of SBM that can be used without causing growth reduction are highly species-specific and influenced by culture systems (Yue et al. 2012). For instance, Markey (2007) reported that 58 % of SBM is being used in grow out culture of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp. Lim and Dominy (1990) demonstrated that 40 % level of a marine mixed protein could be replaced by solvent extracted SBM, whereas higher levels exerted reduced growth performance of L. vannamei. It was also reported that 80 % FM could be replaced by co-extruded soybean and poultry by-product meal supplemented with egg in indoor recirculating water system (Davis and Arnold 2000). Likewise, other researchers suggested different inclusion levels of FM in the diet of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp culture in different conditions (Samocha et al. 2004 a; Browdy et al. 2006; Patnaik et al. 2006; Amaya et al. 2007). This is while in marine shrimp diets, higher levels of dietary SBM usually resulted in lower growth (Akiyama 1990; Floreto et al. 2000). Likewise, Yue et al. (2012) suggested that FM inclusion can be reduced to approximately 200  g kg− 1 diet of <b>whiteleg</b> shrimp when SBM and peanut meal are included instead. Reduced growth performance and increased FCR in L. vannamei fed different diets that gradually replace FM by SBM could be because of anti-nutritional factors, such as saponins, phytoestrogens, allergens, phytate (myo-inositol- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexakisphosphate), protease inhibitors, trypsin inhibitors, lectins and antivitamins (Francis et al. 2001). For example, trypsin inhibitors and lectins prevent the proper activity of digestive enzymes (Gemede and Ratta 2014). The other limitation in application of SBM in fish diet is the improper amino acid composition that does not meet the nutritional requirements of fish (Floreto et al. 2000). In addition, n- 3 lipid composition of SBM is much lower comparing to FM, and thus high inclusion levels of SBM in the diet may result in reduced growth performance (Sharawya et al. 2016).|$|E
