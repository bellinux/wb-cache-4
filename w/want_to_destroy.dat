With his new comrades, he goes with other Exorcists on missions to recover other Innocences scattered around the world. Allen finds people compatible with the Innocence, who become his allies. He fights the Millennium Earl, his army of Akuma and the Noah Family, a group of immortal humans who help the Earl and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the world. Allen and four other Exorcists are sent to locate and protect Cross, since the Millennium Earl has attacked Exorcist generals in his search for the Heart (the most powerful Innocence).

5|$|After Houston {{received}} word that Santa Anna was leading a large force to San Antonio, Bowie offered to lead volunteers {{to defend the}} Alamo from the expected attack. He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, but not many supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to contact}} Kell, Hannay flicks through the notebook, finding it {{contains}} pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map {{in the back}} and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the notebook missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed in the cellar. They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the notebook, which Victoria reveals she had picked from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the notebook to Victoria.|$|E

25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same thing, there {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.|$|E

500|$|For the PSP version, {{the music}} was remixed by Toshiki Konishi, Ryota Kozuka and Atsushi Kitajoh, who also worked on the remixed music for Innocent Sins port. The team, while {{remixing}} the music, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the original's foundation. The ruling concept, as defined by Konishi, was [...] "not to far and not {{too close to the}} original". For the opening animation, Meguro requested Konishi to personally remix the game's original opening theme. It {{was the first time he}} had been put in charge of an opening theme, and it proved troublesome for him, as he needed to rerecord the vocals and make sure he did justice to the original version. For Kitajoh, one of the most notable arrangements he did was for [...] "Maya's Theme": Meguro, who had previously remixed this track for Persona 3: FES, asked for a remix with a faster tempo and incorporated hard rock elements. The new scenario also used remixed music from the original game instead of new tracks.|$|E

Ward, however, stated in the DVD commentary for the episode that such an idea bothered him, because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> the reality of the series. In the end, he noted that he wanted to preserve the status quo by making [...] "the real Finn where he is now ... he isn't still dreaming."

[...] Mays added: [...] "This is something that’s part {{of a lot of}} people’s lives. But Emma is not a cheater. They’ve portrayed her as being somewhat virginal. There’s purity there. She doesn’t just hone in [...] and say, ‘I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> this guy’s relationship.' So Emma is hopeful and sad at the same time. Funny, too.

500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
