5|$|Chris Carter was {{inspired}} to write this episode based on an interest in dendrochronology, a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non-tropical tree species. Carter credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal,</b> having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, to try to be as neutral as possible. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> and based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files.

During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal,</b> but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Gray goes on {{to point}} out {{that at the time of}} this lunch the Attorney General was Richard Kleindienst, who was never implicated in any of the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandals.</b> Even if Smith meant that he was talking about John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, Gray further points out that no one (outside of the conspirators) knew of Mitchell's {{involvement}} until the following April, when John Dean admitted as much to special prosecutors.|$|R

5|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were more inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall. Truman's approval rating fell to 23 percent in mid-1951, which was lower than Richard Nixon's low of 25 percent during the <b>Watergate</b> <b>Scandal</b> in 1974, and Lyndon Johnson's of 28 percent at the height of the Vietnam War in 1968. , it remains the lowest Gallup Poll approval rating recorded by any serving president.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b> Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the election, Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate and was re-elected twice. He became an influential member of the party's conservative wing, serving {{as chairman of the}} Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services. He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he was critical of Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended Nixon in light of the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> of the Nixon administration.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of his Republican counterpart John Heinz, Arlen Specter was viewed somewhat tepidly by the Pennsylvania electorate entering the race, although both men shared similar moderate profiles. Additionally, economic woes had dragged down {{the popularity}} of Republican candidates in the industrial states. Democrats sensed {{the vulnerability of the}} incumbent, and two men with similar experience in the U.S. House, but contrasting political views, vied for the nomination. Don Bailey, the state's incumbent Auditor General, was viewed as the initial favorite, as he projected a strong blue collar image and had moderate positions that were often relatively close to Specter's. Bob Edgar, a Methodist minister and sitting Congressman, had more liberal viewpoints, as he was connected with the Vietnam War-era peace movement and the anti-corruption movement following the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandals.</b> However, issues played a very minor role in the primary, which instead showcased the state's geographical divide, with Delaware County-based Edgar narrowly defeating Westmoreland County-based Bailey.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal,</b> Kennedy pushed {{campaign}} finance reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.|$|E
5|$|It {{was rumored}} that Douglas {{would be given}} a {{political}} appointment in the Truman administration, but the Nixon-Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President. According to Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, the former congresswoman {{could not have been}} appointed dogcatcher. In 1952, she returned to acting, and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential run. She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon's 1972 reelection, and called for his ouster from office during the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the <b>Watergate</b> <b>Scandal,</b> after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E

The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{used the}} story {{as a means to}} reflect {{contemporary}} anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 238 - 239) Editorial {{reaction to}} Gerald R. Ford [...] from his nomination as Vice President to the pardon of Richard Nixon [...] was examined {{to determine how}} major newspapers perceived Ford and whether their perceptions were affected by the <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandals</b> and related events. Unsigned editorials were reviewed in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Christian Science Monitor, Chicago Tribune, Detroit News and Grand Rapids (Mich.) Press. Watergate and {{the plight of the}} Nixon administration profoundly affected some newspapers' perceptions of Gerald Ford. As Nixon's moral stock diminished, Ford's editorial image improved until the man who was initially received as a "bland mediocrity" came {{to be seen as a}} viable alternative to the embattled President. By the time Ford was confirmed, five of the eight newspapers sampled had moved from an essentially negative to an essentially positive position and were praising his strengths and excusing or ignoring his weaknesses. A liberal-conservative split emerged in the study. The more liberal newspapers were more deeply and emotionally involved in the issues and problems of Watergate, were most severe in their criticism of Nixon, exhibited the greatest overall change in attitude toward Ford and were most outraged by the Nixon pardon. The more conservative newspapers were less emotionally involved in Watergate, were less distressed by Nixon's actions, exhibited little or no change in attitude toward Ford and were not as upset by the Nixon pardon (while disapproving of it) ...|$|R
40|$|The George W. Bush {{administration}} will long {{be remembered for}} its constitutional and legal arguments on behalf of exclusive and inherent executive power. In its extreme form, this uncompromising effort appears to have failed, and may even have pushed the judicial branch to limit executive authority and return to a more traditional insistence on interbranch cooperation in foreign affairs. Ironically, the Bush-Cheney legal legacy ultimately {{will depend on the}} Barack Obama administration’s public commitments and legal arguments, but early evidence suggests that President Obama’s assertions of executive power will rest less on assertions of constitutional prerogative, and more heavily on statutory delegation as well as long-standing judicial precedent. psq_ 3712 878 [...] 895 It is no secret that long before his election as vice president, Dick Cheney was deeply committed to the proposition that the executive branch had been dangerously diminished {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandals.</b> The period after Watergate and the Vietnam War, Cheney told reporters on Air Force Two in 2005, was “the nadir of the modern presidency in terms of authority and legitimacy, ” a period in which the chief executive’s ability to lead “in a complicated, dangerous era ” was severely diminished (Baker and VandeHei 2005). Cheney returned to the White House as the second-ranking official in the George W. Bush administration in 2001 determined to restore executive branch power and autonomy. To do so, Cheney pushed others in the administration to aggressively press legal arguments and constitutional assertions not only to achieve their immediate policy goals, but also to set lasting precedents, fortifying the nation’...|$|R
50|$|In 2010 James S. Shapiro {{surveyed}} the authorship question in Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?

Shapiro links {{the revival of the}} Oxfordian movement to the cultural changes that followed the <b>Watergate</b> conspiracy <b>scandal</b> that increased the willingness of the public to believe in governmental conspiracies and cover-ups, and Robert Sawyer suggests that the increased presence of anti-Stratfordian ideas in popular culture {{can be attributed to the}} proliferation of conspiracy theories since the 9/11 attacks.|$|R
