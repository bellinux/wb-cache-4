5|$|Fishing has {{declined}} in importance, but still employed 345 individuals in 2001, about 3.5% of the islands' economically active population, the modern industry concentrating on herring, <b>white</b> <b>fish,</b> lobsters, crabs and other shellfish, and salmon fish farming.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. <b>White</b> <b>fish</b> never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with <b>white</b> <b>fish</b> or pork, {{and is one of}} the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|The islanders' {{livelihood}} {{was based}} on fishing (for <b>white</b> <b>fish,</b> herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of arable and pasture land fertilised by wrack on which sheep, cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in fachaich or ‘fatlings’ - shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm <b>white</b> <b>fish</b> too, are minced {{and shaped}} into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any <b>white</b> <b>fish</b> will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{cod and haddock}} appear most {{commonly}} as the fish used for fish and chips, but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other <b>white</b> <b>fish,</b> such as pollock or coley, plaice, skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear {{most commonly}} in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock, due to their regular availability in a common catch.|$|E
25|$|Shooting {{began in}} August 1959 and lasted until January 15, 1960. Antonioni began filming the island {{sequence}} with the scenes immediately after Anna disappears. The majority of shooting {{on the island}} was filmed on the island Lisca Bianca (<b>white</b> <b>fish</b> bone) with a cast and crew of 50 people. Other locations for the island sequence included Panarea (which was also the production's headquarters), Mondello and Palermo. Filming the island sequence was intended to take three weeks, but ended up lasting for four months. Difficulties included the islands being infested with rats, mosquitoes and reptiles; also, the weather was unexpectedly cold, and the Navy ship hired to transport {{the cast and crew}} to the island every day never appeared. In order to carry personal items and equipment to the island, the crew had to personally build small rafts out of empty gas canisters and wooden planks; these were towed by a launching tug every morning.|$|E

25|$|The waters {{surrounding}} Scotland {{are some}} of the richest in Europe. Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the North East of Scotland and along the west coast, with important fish markets in places such as Aberdeen and Mallaig. Fish and shellfish such as herring, crab, lobster, haddock and cod are landed at ports such as Peterhead, the biggest <b>white</b> <b>fish</b> port in Europe, Fraserburgh, the biggest shellfish port in Europe, Stornoway, Lerwick and Oban. There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Scotland, due initially to the sacrifice of national fishing rights to the EEC on the UK's accession to the Common Market in the 1970s, and latterly to the historically low abundances of commercially valuable fish in the North Sea and parts of the North Atlantic. To rebuild stocks the EU's Common Fisheries Policy places restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, on the days at sea allowed and on fishing gear that can be deployed. These measures have so far been unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|During the 19th century {{agriculture}} {{was based}} on crops of [...] barley, potatoes, oats, turnips and cabbages and livestock including sheep and cattle. Ponies were kept, although their use may have been to transport materials to the lighthouse, and goats were also recorded in 1863. Berneray lacks peat, {{which had to be}} brought over from Mingulay at considerable effort. The harvest of the seas remained important, with the island a base for exploiting the rich stocks of <b>white</b> <b>fish</b> by fishermen from several local islands. Seabirds were also {{an important part of the}} economy, supplying both food and feathers for sale. Such was the abundance that in 1868 a single fowler caught 600 birds in six to eight hours.|$|E

There is also a large fishmart and the local lifeboat is stationed there too. From June 2007, a summer-only weekly ferry service operated by the Faroese company Smyril Line reopened, connecting Scrabster with the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, but has now been discontinued.|$|E
