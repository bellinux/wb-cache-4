25|$|The homophile {{movement}} lobbied {{to establish}} a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability.

500|$|Prior to the Roman occupation, Volubilis covered an area {{of about}} , built on a V-shaped ridge between the Fertassa and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north-south axis.

Under the Romans, the city was expanded considerably on a northeast-southwest axis, increasing in size to about [...] Most of the city's public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city. The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part, behind the Decumanus Maximus (main street), which bisected the Roman-era part of the city.

500|$|The first Danish farmer-owned {{co-operative}} bacon factory {{was established}} in 1887. [...] There were soon more, and by 1897 there <b>were</b> <b>dozens.</b> [...] By 1900 the co-operatives outnumbered private enterprises. [...] By this time the export of live pigs had almost ceased, being replaced by export of pork and bacon. [...] There followed intense competition between the co-operatives and private producers, with the co-operatives eventually winning out. [...] The co-operatives had competition from foreign investors as well as indigenous enterprises. [...] The first of these was I. D. Koopmann of Hamburg, who bought and opened new bacon factories {{in order to get}} around the German ban on live pigs. [...] Koopmann refused to do business with the co-operatives, calling the movement [...] "a sick idea". [...] They worked closely with Denny & Co. of London—the Denny family were a major bacon manufacturer in Ireland and between them they controlled {{a large portion of the}} UK market. [...] Denny's took over Koopmann's when the latter got into debt in 1894. [...] Denny's never managed to get on top of the co-operatives, but they held on in Denmark until 1968 when they finally sold what was left of the Danish operation to the Federation of Danish Co-operatives. [...] Another major foreign player, ironically, was the English Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). [...] The CWS had depots in Denmark from 1881, taking advantage of the refusal of London dealers to buy from the co-operatives. [...] From 1899, however, they started setting up their own manufacturing in Denmark. [...] Production grew until 1930 but then slowly declined and CWS started selling up in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{released}} {{their third}} album, OK Computer, in June 1997. The album found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone {{to call the}} album a [...] "stunning art-rock tour de force". Radiohead denied {{being part of the}} progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, a band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's bestseller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), although Yorke said the album's lyrics had been inspired by observing the [...] "speed" [...] of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called [...] "end-of-the-millennium blues" [...] in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. According to journalist Alex Ross, the band had become [...] "the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation—as the Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before." [...] OK Computer met with critical acclaim. Yorke said he was [...] "amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."OK Computer was the band's first number-one UK chart debut, propelling them to commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. [...] "Paranoid Android", [...] "Karma Police" [...] and [...] "No Surprises" [...] were released as singles from the album, of which [...] "Karma Police" [...] was most successful internationally.
