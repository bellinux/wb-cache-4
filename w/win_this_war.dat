At that very time Ritter offered an opposing view on Portuguese radio station TSF: [...] "The United States is going to leave Iraq with its tail between its legs, defeated. It is a war we can not win... We {{do not have the}} military means to take over Baghdad and for this reason I believe the defeat of the United States in this war is inevitable...

2500|$|Wednesday saw an {{afternoon}} conference at Buckingham Palace, {{hosted by the}} King and chaired by Balfour. There is some doubt as to the originator of the idea, although Adams considers that it was Bonar Law. This {{is supported by a}} handwritten note of Aitken's, reproduced in A.J.P. Taylor's life of that politician, which reads: [...] "6th Wed. Meeting at BL house with G. (Lloyd George) and C. (Carson)—Decide on Palace Conference." [...] Conversely, Crewe suggests that the suggestion came jointly from Lord Derby and Edwin Montagu. However it came about, it did not bring the compromise the King sought. Within two hours of its break-up, Asquith, after consulting his Liberal colleagues, except for Lloyd George, declined to serve under Bonar Law, who accordingly declined the King's commission. At 7.00pm. Lloyd George was invited to form a Government. In just over twenty four hours he had done so, forming a small War Cabinet instead of the mooted War Council, and at 7.30 p.m. on Thursday 7 December he kissed hands as Prime Minister. His achievement in creating a government was considerable, given that almost all of the senior Liberals sided with Asquith. Balfour's acceptance of the Foreign Office made it possible. Others placed a greater responsibility on Asquith as the author of his own downfall, Churchill writing; [...] "A fierce, resolute Asquith, fighting with all his powers would have conquered easily. But the whole trouble arose from {{the fact that there was}} no fierce resolute Asquith to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> or any other." ...|$|E

60|$|War is a {{thing that}} changes very rapidly, and {{we have in the}} Tanks only the first of a great series of {{offensive}} developments. They are bound to be improved, at a great pace.

It is of supreme necessity to the Allies if they are to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> outright that the lead in inventions and enterprise which the British have won over the Germans in this matter should be retained. It is our game now to press the advantage for all it is worth. We have to keep ahead to win.

For thousands of years the military tradition has been a tradition of discipline.

Individual quality, inventive organisation and industrialism will <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>war.</b> And no class is so innocent of these things as the military caste. Long accustomed {{as they are to}} the importance of moral effect they put a brave face upon the business; they save their faces astonishingly, but they are no longer guiding and directing this war, they are being pushed from behind by forces they never foresaw and cannot control. The aeroplanes and great guns have bolted with them, the tanks begotten of naval and civilian wits, shove them to victory in spite of themselves.|$|E
