From a distance, {{the dimensions of}} this construction are deceptive [...] The largest man-made structure ever built, the Grand Palace could cover more than ten of the Imperium's most populous cities under one roof, a fact that becomes more apparent when you learn Atreides attendants and their families, housed spaciously in the Palace Annex, number some thirty-five million souls [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the Grand Reception Hall of the Palace at Arrakeen, be prepared to feel dwarfed before an immensity never before conceived.

50|$|The Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré {{is a major}} Roman Catholic {{place of}} pilgrimage and has a copy of Michelangelo's Pietà (the {{original}} is in the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). The basilica {{is also known as}} a place of miracles. One of the builders of the original church, Louis Guimont, helped build the church despite having severe scoliosis and needing the aid of a crutch. When the church was complete, he was able to walk independently. Subsequent visitors to the church who have prayed have left their canes, crutches and walking aides behind as testament to their healing. The main wall <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the basilica is now completely covered with crutches.|$|R

I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man." [...] The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said [...] "Nineteen years is a long time. .... But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt.

50|$|Erskine, Markham, and Howie (2001) discuss script-based inferences {{and their}} effects on memory {{retrieval}} and eyewitness testimony. Scripts are schemas for specific events that are constructed from experience (Lindsay, J., 2014). For example, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a restaurant, you generally know to tell the host or hostess the amount of people in your party; once you are seated at your table, you know you must decide what to order. These commonly known actions {{are part of the}} general restaurant script. Scripts are usually beneficial in that they help organize one’s thoughts and they facilitate a better understanding of a situation (Abelson, 1981). However, these script biases can also have effects that are damaging in the retrieval of accurate memories. Scripts can lead people to report details of events that did not happen, even if those details fit with the script of the event.|$|E

Trump also said he was considering [...] "something on a larger scale" [...] for the project. In July 2004, Ruffin said the project had been delayed up to that point because of other business ventures, including Trump's reality television show, The Apprentice. That month, Trump and Ruffin announced revised plans for Trump International Hotel and Tower, a $300 million condominium-hotel with over 1,000 units. Although Trump held a Nevada gaming license, he chose not to include a casino on the property. Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump, later said, [...] "We have no problem getting a gaming license, but we wanted to do something different here. We wanted a true luxury resort experience.

[...] I stopped and I thought about it and I said, You know, we’re never afraid as we enter a courtroom or as we begin a presentation, fear suggests that we’re not prepared or that we’re inadequate.

[...] I call it [...] "the adrenaline of excellence," [...] I call it that because, as you walk into a room, what you experience is your body and your muscles tighten, your heart and your mind concentrate, and your body and your heart and mind are telling you that you’re prepared to deliver peak performance, so I call the feeling of what you’re about to do [...] "the adrenaline of excellence." ...|$|E

The business got its start in 2005 when Hank Harris, professor of animal science and veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine at Iowa State University, and Matt Erdman, a doctoral student, discovered a vaccine to prevent Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). The PRRS virus causes infertility and reproductive problems in pigs and can be economically devastating to producers.

The company started out as Sirrah and changed its name to Harrisvaccines Inc. in 2008. 2 ̆ 2 In 2009, Harrisvaccines was the first company to market a vaccine for the novel H 1 N 1 virus for swine, 2 ̆ 2 Harris says. 2 ̆ 2 Today the company is thriving and making progress in finding solutions to PRRS and other diseases. 2 ̆ 2 Since its start, the company has grown from one lab with two scientists to four labs with 20 employees.

40|$|Abstract Microbes mediate global {{biogeochemical}} {{cycles through}} their metabolism, and all metabolic processes {{begin with the}} interaction between the microbial cell wall or membrane and the external environment. For all heterotrophs and many autotrophs, critical growth substrates and factors are present within the dilute and heterogeneous mixture of compounds that constitutes dissolved organic matter (DOM). In short, the microbe [...] molecule interaction is one of the fundamental reactions within the global carbon cycle. Here, I summarize recent findings from studies that examine DOM [...] microbe interactions from either the DOM perspective (organic geochemistry) or the microbe perspective (microbial ecology). Gaps in our knowledge are highlighted and future integrative research directions are proposed. Key Words dissolved organic matter, microorganisms, metabolomics, ABC transporters OVERVIEW <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a biologist’s (or biochemist’s) office, you will likely see a large poster of all the chemical reactions that occur in a cell’s metabolism. Perhaps, like me, you will be struck by the sheer complexity of the pathways, the interdependence of all the reaction arrows, and the critical role played by each reaction {{in the life of the}} cell. Now imagine a reaction map for a “superorganism ” such as the ocean. Instead of individual compounds connected by reaction pathways, the map would show organisms connected by chemical compounds that pass through the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool. Averaged over large spatial and temporal scales, these individual organisms and chemical interactions would culminate in the observed global elemental cycles. This view of the marine ecosystem is ascending in the microbial ecology literature (Azam & Worden 2004, Gasol et al. 2008, Raes & Bork 2008), and the notions of ecological functioning units and synergisti...|$|E
