500|$|During his loan spell at Hull City, Campbell {{received}} his first call-up to the England under-21 team, coming on {{as a substitute}} in a match against Poland on 25 March 2008. He scored his first international goal on 18 November 2008 in a 2–0 victory over the Czech Republic Under-21s. He also scored in the second group match of the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship against Spain, in a 2–0 victory on 18 June 2009. He was sent off in the semi-final of the championship against Sweden. Following his under-21 experience, Campbell's Sunderland manager Steve Bruce urged Fabio Capello to consider Campbell for promotion to the senior squad saying, [...] "the England manager should {{have a look at}} him", also saying [...] "As for England, why not? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> with up-and-coming young talent?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E
500|$|The House of Representatives {{debated the}} bill on July 13 and 14, 1965. The {{discussion}} was wide-ranging. Idaho Congressman Compton I. White opposed the bill, having prepared a chart showing the debasement of the Roman denarius between the years 1 and 300, though stating {{that he did}} not expect that coinage debasement would cause a government to fall. Nevada's Walter S. Baring noted that the Treasury was selling silver to the makers of cutlery and stated, [...] "I would rather eat with chopsticks than take the silver out of our coinage". Massachusetts' Silvio Conte denigrated Sir Thomas Gresham for illicit profits when the Royal Exchange in London was established, but conceded that Gresham's Law would nevertheless cause base metal coins to drive the silver ones from circulation. Iowa's Harold Gross asked Conte that if the U.S. was going to debase its coinage, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> back to wampum. Minor amendments, including removing the mint mark from coinage for up to five years, were agreed to. There was objection to the committee amendment removing silver entirely from the half dollar; it was defeated 48—94, leaving the half dollar at 40 percent silver. Congressman James F. Battin of Montana offered an amendment to make the dime and quarter out of 40 percent silver; although Patman objected that the committee had rejected the idea, it initially passed 122—112. However, this was at the Committee of the Whole stage, and Patman got the House to reject the Battin amendment, 197—218. After other attempts were made in vain to derail the bill, the House Minority Leader, Michigan's Gerald R. Ford, asked that there be a recorded vote on H.R. 8926, and the bill passed, 255—151, Ford voting in favor. Patman then had the House amend the Senate bill, S. 2080, to reflect the House-passed language, and pass it.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 1999, Greenlee Smythe {{made her}} debut. After winning the role, Budig further {{explained}} {{her interest in}} the part and her early portrayal of the character: [...] "This was a recurring role," [...] she stated. [...] "I didn't {{have to go in}} and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble.

2500|$|In March 2006, {{various sources}} {{reported}} Shetty's joining PETA {{as part of}} an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses. According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. [...] "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus". Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. [...] "I thought I should stop that.
