30|$|Litterfall and FRB are {{important}} vectors of nutrient recycling in forest ecosystems. Their turnover is usually determined by species, age groups, canopy cover, weather conditions and biotic factors. Total C input into soil through litter plus root turnover was 6.78 and 3.35  Mg∙ha– 1 ∙yr– 1 in US and DS, respectively, suggesting substantial retention of C in the vegetation over in annual cycle (45  % in US and 51  % in DS). It {{indicates that the}} present forest is C-accumulating system, acting as a significant global C sink, as other <b>wet</b> tropical forests (<b>Pan</b> et al. 2011).|$|R
50|$|The Pan bagnat (<b>pan</b> banhat for <b>wet</b> bread, also <b>pan</b> bagna, and {{alternatively}} in French as pain bagnat) is a sandwich {{that is a}} specialty of the Provence region of France. It is also a specialty food and street food of Nice, France. The sandwich is composed of pain de campagne, whole wheat bread formed in a circle, although white bread is also sometimes used, around the classic Salade Niçoise, a salad composed mainly of raw vegetables, hard boiled eggs, anchovies and/or tuna, and olive oil (never mayonnaise). Sometimes balsamic vinegar, ground pepper, and salt will also be added. It has historically been prepared as a use for day-old bread.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan International Airlines {{was set up}} on 11 March 1955, after Orient Airways {{merged with}} the government's {{proposed}} new airline. During the same year the airline opened its first international service, from Karachi to London Heathrow Airport via Cairo International Airport and Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Fiumicino, Italy, using three newly acquired Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellations. The DC-3s continued operating the domestic services in Pakistan. In May 1956, PIA ordered two further Super Lockheed Constellations of the latest L-1049H version and five Vickers Viscount 815.In March 1960, PIA became the first Asian airline to use jet aircraft when Boeing 707 services were introduced. The aircraft were <b>wet</b> leased from <b>Pan</b> American and in 1961 services were begun to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{spinnability}} of {{a spinning}} solution using DMSO as the solvent was investigated for dry-jet <b>wet</b> spinning of <b>PAN</b> precursor fiber. Among many varia-bles responsible for spinnability, the coagulating condi-tions, the air gap length, the nonsolvent content in spin-ning solution, and the spinning temperature {{have been viewed}} as the key factors, and they were investigated in this study. It was found however, unlike in the wet spin-ning, the spinnability in dry-jet wet spinning process was barely influenced by the coagulating conditions, likely at-tributable {{to the existence of}} the air gap. However, the spinnability worsened when the air gap was longer than 30 mm. The quality of the spinning solution deteriorated with the increasing water content in it. The spinnability improved when the spinning temperature was maintained between 60 and 728 C and turned down once the tempera-ture was over 728 C. The experimental results indicated that all the factors should be comprehensively considered to ensure good spinnability in dry-jet wet spinning proc...|$|R
40|$|Optimum process {{conditions}} were investigated for maximizing the mechanical {{properties of the}} carbon fiber by from <b>wet</b> spun polyacrylonitrile (<b>PAN)</b> fiber precursors. The process variables chosen were treatment temperature, applied tension in stabilization process. The temperature profile of the stabilization was set {{on the basis of}} exothermic peaks of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) result. Both tensile strength and modulus increased with holding at onset temperatures of the exothermic peaks for extended duration, and with a higher heating rate up to the onset temperatures at a given applied tension among the experimental conditions. The increase in load monotonously increased the tensile modulus, on the other hand, the tensile strength was maximum at the load of 15 mg/filament (T 15). The load 20 mg/ filament (T 20) was considered to be exceeded to form oriented crystalline structure, possibly introducing more defects in the fiber than under load of T 15. The sample CP 3 -T 15 O 5 H 30 showed the best tensile properties among the samples experimented whose tensile properties are compatible with the commercialized grade of general purpose carbon fibers even at low carbonization temperature such as 800 oC (the carbonization temperature in the commercial process. 1300 ∼ 1500 oC) ...|$|R
