5|$|While the {{painting}} largely representedand {{was one of}} the pioneers ofan emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche's depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Alloa were in {{good form}} before the match, losing {{only three of}} their {{previous}} 22 games in all competitions {{since the start of}} the season in late July. At the time of the final, Alloa were equal on points at the top of the Second Division table but ranked third on goal difference. Inverness were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Alloa <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Division. Inverness were ranked seventh from ten in the First Division at the time of the final, 20 points behind runaway leaders St. Mirren. After five games unbeaten in the league, Inverness lost their last league game before the final 5–1 away to Morton.|$|E

The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alfred P.

5|$|As Liverpool were {{competing}} in the Premier League, they entered the competition {{in the third round}} and were drawn against Millwall, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Championship. Liverpool fielded a team that did not feature many of their regular starters including Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso. Despite this, they won the match at Millwall's home ground The New Den, 3–0 courtesy of two goals from striker Milan Baroš and midfielder Salif Diao. Liverpool were drawn against fellow Premier League side Middlesbrough in the fourth round. Again Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez did not field many of his first choice players, however two goals from striker Neil Mellor secured a 2–0 victory at their home ground of Anfield.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolph Bierwirth, in September, the {{battalion}} was issued with a circular brown over red Unit Colour Patch (UCP), with a border of grey to denote that {{the battalion}} was a 2nd AIF unit. However, {{the circumstances of}} the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in the situation of the battalion's personnel being issued two different UCPs. Personnel <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with the brown over red UCP. However, this UCP was issued without reference to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of a black over green oval in a circle of grey: this was intended to link the battalion to the 33rd Battalion, which had served during the First World War. Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the brown and red patches.|$|E

5|$|Cooksey joined Oldham Athletic {{on trial}} in July 2003. At the age of 23, he stepped up three leagues into {{professional}} football permanently when Iain Dowie signed him on for financially troubled Oldham in August, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Division. Bob Dowie, who was Cooksey's former manager at Chesham United, recommended the player to his brother, Iain. He followed {{in the footsteps of}} Fitz Hall and Wayne Andrews who also joined the club from Chesham as recommendations from Bob Dowie. Cooksey scored twice in Oldham's 3–0 home victory over Carlisle United in their FA Cup first round match on 8 November 2003. When the new season, 2003–04, started Cooksey was unable to make his debut due to suspension. He made 37 Second Division appearances for Oldham in the 2003–04 season, scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead {{train and}} were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, {{most of whom}} appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected {{by the force of}} the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.

The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E
