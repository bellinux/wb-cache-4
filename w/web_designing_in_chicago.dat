40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the user {{experience}} quality of responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> on mobile devices. Data were collected from 156 students at Universitas Indonesia, who were asked to evaluate user experience of <b>web</b> <b>design</b> {{on one of the}} following scenarios: responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> both desktop and mobile device environment and nonresponsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> mobile device environment. The user experience quality was measured by looking at the number of clicks and scrolls as well as information quality that has been experienced by user. The results of the ANOVA test proved that responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> was able to maintain the user experience quality of website on home functionality, content readability, and enjoyment using website but not on the information architecture. <b>In</b> addition, responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> was also proven {{to reduce the amount of}} scrolling when reading content.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to describe how a web page communicates with user. How the web page effects on visitor, how the information is presented, and what possibilities are offered through the user interface. The work is divided into a four main parts. First explain terms accessibility and usability. Next two parts focus on the main subject of this work. Information <b>design</b> looks into <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> view of content. It deals with organization and filtering information, navigation schema and wireframe. Graphic <b>design</b> deals with <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> view of appearance. In this part are described the elements of web from header to footer, color schema, graphic look of navigation or shadowing and transparency. Typography and optimization belong here too. Last part applies the theory of graphic and information <b>design</b> on concrete <b>web</b> page...|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the scope}} of the project, <b>web</b> <b>design</b> may involve {{collaboration}} between software engineers and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout sketch or handling just the graphics in an HTML editor, while the advance coding is done separately by programmers. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> positions often known as web masters.|$|R

50|$|Henrietta Barclay Paist (1870-1930) was an American artist, designer, teacher, and author. She {{is perhaps}} best known for her china painting, a popular turn-of-the-century pastime.

40|$|Users {{can assess}} the visual {{appeal of a}} web page within 50 {{milliseconds}} and color {{is the first thing}} noticed onscreen. That directly influences user perception of the website, and choosing appealing color combinations is therefore crucial for successful <b>web</b> <b>design.</b> Recent scientific research has identified which individual colors are culturally preferred <b>in</b> <b>web</b> <b>design</b> <b>in</b> different countries but there is no similar research on hue combinations. Currently no effective, scientifically based guidelines on combining hues for web designers exist either, since recent research by Ou et al and Szabo et al, among others, proves the classic color harmonies invalid. Therefore this study aims to identify guidelines for culturally appropriate hue combination <b>in</b> context of <b>web</b> <b>design.</b> The study is limited to culturally appropriate combining of hues in Thai and Swedish web design...|$|R
