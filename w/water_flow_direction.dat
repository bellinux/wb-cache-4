50|$|The Nagarjuna Sagar left canal is {{presently}} supplying nearly 130 TMC water for irrigation needs in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states.

The cost of this canal redesigning and the associated pump houses would be one third of a new scheme to transfer Godavari river water into Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir at its FRL 590 ft MSL with least possible total pumping head.

50|$|Stray current {{corrosion}} occurs because: 1) {{the piping}} {{system has been}} connected accidentally or intentionally to a DC voltage source; 2) the piping does not have metal-to-metal electrical continuity throughout its length; or 3) if the voltage source is AC, one or more naturally occurring minerals coating the pipe interior may act as a rectifier, converting AC current to DC. The DC voltage forces the water within the piping {{to act as an}} electrical conductor (an electrolyte). Electric current leaves the copper pipe, moves though the water across the nonconductive section (a plastic filter housing, for example), and reenters the pipe on the opposite side. Pitting occurs at the electrically negative side (the cathode), which may happen to be either upstream or downstream with respect to the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>direction.</b> Pitting occurs because the electrical voltage ionizes the pipe's interior copper metal, which reacts chemically with dissolved minerals in the water, creating copper salts; these copper salts are soluble in water and wash away. Microscopic pits eventually grow and consolidate to form pin holes. When one is discovered, there are almost certainly more that have not yet leaked. A complete discussion of stray current corrosion can be found in chapter 11, section 11.4.3, of Handbook of Corrosion Engineering, by Pierre Roberge.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydro power}} plant of 25 MW {{capacity}} can be installed by routing Polavaram Right bank canal water to Prakasam barrage via existing Eluru canal. Polavaram Right bank canal is approaching the outskirts of Vijayawada city at 33 m MSL along the hill slopes located north of Ambapuram village. This point is only 7 km north of Prakasam Barrage but the canal takes another 30 km detour to get connected to the Prakasam barrage pond near Ibrahimpatnam town. The existing Eluru canal from Prakasam barrage was dug across the elevated ridge/doab (where Vijayawada city is located) to cross the Krishna river basin and supply water in to lower Budameru river basin. This canal while crossing the city is a deep cut canal (maximum water level below local ground level). Eluru deep cut canal portion (first 3 km length) can be safely used to feed water (reversing <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>direction)</b> in to Prakasam barrage pond (full pond level at 17.35 m MSL) by connecting Polavaram Right bank canal with the canal after Ayodhya Nagar.

This thesis shows the development and application of analytical and numerical models to study the effect of different evaporator parameters on heat pump efficiency, as well as the possible advantages of using the flow reversal method in a water-source or ice-maker heat pump. The conclusion reached from these studies is that periodic water flow reversals inside an evaporator with freezing help improve the performance of a heat pump system in two different ways.

These include land management and practice, water balance, erosion, nutrients, carbon and vegetation dynamics. Model output can {{be an integral part of}} an evidence-based approach to the procurement of environmental outcomes. Biophysical models typically operate on discrete computation cells of a catchment in the order of 20 - 50 metres and on daily time steps. They can be used to evaluate the production and environmental aspects of farming systems and catchments. These models also provide estimates of deep drainage, sub-surface lateral flows and surface runoff. Water partitioning is important as vertically dominated recharge and horizontally dominated flow produce very different environment outcomes. However, the effect of these flows on nutrient, contaminants and sediment transport can only be assessed if the output from one computational cell forms the input to the neighbouring computational cells of the farm/catchment.
