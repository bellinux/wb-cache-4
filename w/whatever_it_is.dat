5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
25|$|Samadhi is oneness {{with the}} subject of {{meditation}}. There is no distinction, during the eighth limb of yoga, between the actor of meditation, the act of meditation {{and the subject of}} meditation. Samadhi is that spiritual state when one's mind is so absorbed in <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> contemplating on, that the mind loses the sense of its own identity. The thinker, the thought process and the thought fuse {{with the subject}} of thought. There is only oneness, samadhi.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety pin}} is a {{fastening}} device, {{a variation of}} the regular pin, which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin to <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.|$|E

25|$|The {{fermentation}} {{processes to}} produce propanol and butanol from cellulose are fairly tricky to execute, and the Weizmann organism (Clostridium acetobutylicum) currently used to perform these conversions produces an extremely unpleasant smell, and {{this must be}} taken into consideration when designing and locating a fermentation plant. This organism also dies when the butanol content of <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fermenting rises to 7%. For comparison, yeast dies when the ethanol content of its feedstock hits 14%. Specialized strains can tolerate even greater ethanol concentrations - so-called turbo yeast can withstand up to 16% ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. They are free to define themselves and do <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{system of}} the {{division}} of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising {{as a result of the}} desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the USA. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.|$|E

25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually let themselves down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E

500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you need to find out, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E

Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that makes us behave well when nobody is looking... Those who believe that the existence of conscience is a proof of a godly design are advancing an argument that simply cannot be disproved because there is no evidence for or against it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] {{began as}} two {{different}} demos, one variously called [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] and [...] "69" [...] (which eventually {{evolved into the}} B-side [...] "Lady with the Spinning Head") and an alternately arranged demo called [...] "Light My Way". Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E

500|$|Cartwright's normal {{speaking}} {{voice is}} said to have [...] "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For [...] "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.|$|E
500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did do all that stuff for which I got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{named the}} song the 4th best song of 2012, calling it [...] "the year's deepest love song [...] won us all." [...] Complex named the track the fourth best song of 2011, writing that [...] "Ocean's voice explores those awkward spaces {{in a new}} relationship, making the eternal lover's {{questions}} sound new and urgent. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> Frank Ocean's [...] "Thinking About Forever" [...] {{is one of those}} songs that will never get old." [...] Beyoncé reportedly cried while listening to the song, and wrote Ocean a poem of support. Knowles and Ocean had previously collaborated on the track [...] "I Miss You". The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked [...] "Thinkin Bout You" [...] at number four to find the best music of 2012.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, or <b>whatever,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|Composer Gus Levene {{commented that}} Sinatra's {{strength}} {{was that when}} it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a [...] "genius" [...] ability and feeling, which with the [...] "rare combination of voice and showmanship" [...] made him the [...] "original singer" [...] which others who followed most tried to emulate. George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "charisma, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about him, that no one else had". Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that [...] "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the [...] "swinging image on which the town is built", adding that no other entertainer quite [...] "embodied the glamour" [...] associated with Las Vegas as him.

500|$|Title TK {{begins with}} [...] "Little Fury", {{named after a}} kind of pocketknife sold at truck stops with the word [...] "fury" [...] written {{along the side of}} the blade. On the call and {{response}} track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, a funky drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by surf music and grunge. J.R. Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that [...] "Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies. I'm not part of that club, it says." [...] For PopMatterss Matt Cibula, the repeated line [...] "Hold what you've got" [...] is the Deals' reminder to themselves to keep the Breeders intact henceforth.|$|E
