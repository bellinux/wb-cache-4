Gingerbreads absorbed higher amount of water (20 – 25 g/ 100 g on dry weight basis) at a w> 0. 70 in comparison to biscuits studied mainly due to higher content of sucrose and/or other simple saccharides. Monolayer moisture content evaluated by BET and GAB models were in general higher for the gingerbreads.

40|$|International audienceWater {{activities}} {{of a series}} of polyol/water systems were measured with an AquaLab dew point <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> at 298 K. The investigated polyols with carbon numbers from n = 2 - 7 are all in liquid state at room temperature and miscible at any molar ratio with water. In aqueous solutions with the same molar concentration, the diols with lower molecular weight lead to lower water activities than those with higher molecular weights. For diols with four or more carbon atoms, the hydrophilicity shows considerable differences between isomers: The 1, 2 -isomers - consisting of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic part - bind less strongly to water than isomers with a more balanced distribution of the hydroxyl groups. The experimental water activities were compared with the predictions of the group contribution method UNIFAC: the model predictions overestimate the water activity of water/polyol systems of substances with two or more hydroxyl groups and can not describe the decreased binding to water of isomers with hydrophobic tails. To account for the differences between isomers, a modified UNIFAC parameterization was developed, that allows to discriminate between three types of alkyl groups depending on their position in the molecule. These new group interaction parameters were calculated using water {{activities of}} alcohol/water mixtures. This leads to a distinctly improved agreement of model predictions with experimental results while largely keeping the simplicity of the functional group approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{soil water}} {{available}} to crops {{is defined by}} specific values of water potential limits. Underlying the estimation of hydro-physical limits, identified as permanent wilting point (PWP) and field capacity (FC), is {{the selection of a}} suitable method based on a multi-criteria analysis that is not always clear and defined. In this kind of analysis, the time required for measurements must be taken into consideration as well as other external measurement factors, e. g., the reliability and suitability of the study area, measurement uncertainty, cost, effort and labour invested. In this paper, the efficiency of different methods for determining hydro-physical limits is evaluated by using indices that allow for the calculation of efficiency in terms of effort and cost. The analysis evaluates both direct determination methods (pressure plate - PP and <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> - WAM) and indirect estimation methods (pedotransfer functions - PTFs). The PTFs must be validated for the area of interest before use, but the time and cost associated with this validation are not included in the cost of analysis. Compared to the other methods, the combined use of PP and WAM to determine hydro-physical limits differs significantly in time and cost required and quality of information. For direct methods, increasing sample size significantly reduces cost and time. This paper assesses the effectiveness of combining a general analysis based on efficiency indices and more specific analyses based on the different influencing factors, which were considered separately so as not to mask potential benefits or drawbacks that are not evidenced in efficiency estimation...|$|E

The study was conducted over four years (2010 - 2013) in a commercial vineyard (Galicia, NW Spain). The volumetric soil water content (θ) (with TDR) and predawn (ψp), midday (ψm) and stem (ψstem) leaf-water potential were determined with a <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> during the growing stages (flowering-harvest) from 2010 - 2013. The number of clusters, their weight and yield/vine were determined at harvest. Must composition was studied to evaluate nutrition treatments. Ψp is presented as the best indicator of the water status of the plant, and the sole use of θ is not recommended as a reference. The soil-plant water status variables were strongly correlated, especially between foliar variables (0. 91 <R 2 < 0. 98), with θ presenting the lowest reliability (0. 28 <R 2 < 0. 81). SDI was the treatment with the highest hydric comfort and greater yield/vine (6. 1 kg) and weight per cluster (95. 0 g), but lower elements concentration in must. The water stress integral showed that the veraison and harvest stages were very sensitive to water stress in vines. Linear relationships were established between Sψp and W (R 2 = 0. 65) and Y (R 2 = 0. 56) at veraison. The water stress integral is presented as a useful working tool for vine growers because it allows the prediction of future yield at early phenological states. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{technical}} performance of <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> for automated detection of estrus in dairy farming has been studied, and such meters are already used in practice. However, {{information on the}} economic consequences of using <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> is lacking. The current study analyzes the economic benefits of a sensor system for detection of estrus and appraises the feasibility of an investment in such a system. A stochastic dynamic simulation model was used to simulate reproductive performance of a dairy herd. The number of cow places in this herd was fixed at 130. The model started with 130 randomly drawn cows (in a Monte Carlo process) and simulated calvings and replacement of these cows in subsequent years. Default herd characteristics were a conception rate of 50 %, an 8 -wk dry-off period, and an average milk production level of 8, 310 kg per cow per 305 d. Model inputs were derived from real farm data and expertise. For the analysis, visual detection by the farmer (“without” situation) was compared with automated detection with <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> (“with” situation). For visual estrus detection, an estrus detection rate of 50 % and a specificity of 100 % were assumed. For automated estrus detection, an estrus detection rate of 80 % and a specificity of 95 % were assumed. The results of the cow simulation model were used to estimate {{the difference between the}} annual net cash flows in the “with” and “without” situations (marginal financial effect) and the internal rate of return (IRR) as profitability indicators. The use of <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> led to improved estrus detection and, therefore, to a decrease in the average calving interval and subsequent increase in annual milk production. For visual estrus detection, the average calving interval was 419 d and average annual milk production was 1, 032, 278 kg. For <b>activity</b> <b>meters,</b> the average calving interval was 403 d and the average annual milk production was 1, 043, 398 kg. It was estimated that the initial investment in <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> would cost € 17, 728 for a herd of 130 cows, with an additional cost of € 90 per year for the replacement of malfunctioning <b>activity</b> <b>meters.</b> Changes in annual net cash flows arising from using an <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> included extra revenues from increased milk production and number of calves sold, increased costs from more inseminations, calvings, and feed consumption, and reduced costs from fewer culled cows and less labor for estrus detection. These changes in cash flows were caused mainly by changes in the technical results of the simulated dairy herds, which arose from differences in the estrus detection rate and specificity between the “with” and “without” situations. The average marginal financial effect in the “with” and “without” situations was € 2, 827 for the baseline scenario, with an average IRR of 11 %. The IRR {{is a measure of the}} return on invested capital. Investment in <b>activity</b> <b>meters</b> was generally profitable. The most influential assumptions on the profitability of this investment were the assumed culling rules and the increase in sensitivity of estrus detection between the “without” and the “with” situation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{experimental data}} of the temperature dependence of water activity in aqueous organic solutions relevant for tropospheric conditions (200 – 273 K). Water activity (a w) at low temperatures (T) is a crucial parameter for predicting homogeneous ice nucleation. We investigated temperature-dependent water activities, ice freezing and melting temperatures of solutions, and vapour pressures of a selection of atmospherically relevant aqueous organic systems. To measure a w over a wide composition range and {{with a focus on}} low temperatures, we use various a w measurement techniques and instruments: a dew point <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> <b>meter,</b> an electrodynamic balance (EDB), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and a setup to measure the total gas phase pressure at equilibrium over aqueous solutions. Water activity measurements were performed for aqueous multicomponent and multifunctional organic mixtures containing the functional groups typically found in atmospheric organic aerosols, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, ketone, ether, ester, and aromatic groups. The aqueous organic systems studied at several fixed compositions over a considerable temperature range differ significantly in their temperature dependence. Aqueous organic systems of 1, 4 -butanediol and methoxyacetic acid show a moderate decrease in a w with decreasing temperature. The aqueous M 5 system (a multicomponent system containing five different dicarboxylic acids) and aqueous 2 -(2 -ethoxyethoxy) ethanol solutions both show a strong increase of water activity with decreasing temperature at high solute concentrations for T T < 260 K, respectively. These measurements show that the temperature trend of a w can be reversed at low temperatures and that linear extrapolations of high-temperature data may lead to erroneous predictions. To avoid this, experimentally determined a w at low temperature are needed to improve thermodynamic models towards lower temperatures and for improved predictions of the ice nucleation ability of organic–water systems...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to develop a method to {{simulate}} the transfer conditions (energy and water) of spray-drying. Typical curves were registered with the <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> on water, dairy and food concentrates (Fig 1.) [1]. These curves showed that the relative humidity (RH) from the pressure sensor as a function of time can be represented by a sigmoid equation. Two phases can be identified on the curves obtained for pure water and milk concentrates: Initially, at the beginning of desorption, there was a constant RH (ie rate of drying) phase. This constant phase corresponds to free water evaporation. The second phase was the falling rate period, which was very short for pure water and much longer for milk concentrates, whatever the total solid content. We assumed that this corresponded to the evaporation of bound water, which involves extra energy (EE) in order to overcome binding (indirectly the bound strength of water). The area under the curve of each part thus represents the amounts of free and bound water desorbed, respectively. EE is calculated as a function of the drying kinetics according to the desorption curves (Fig 1.). When the drying kinetic of a concentrate is similar to the drying kinetic of pure water, no EE is required. If the drying kinetic is two slower, energy requirement is two higher than for pure water. The difference with the latent heat of evaporation required for pure water determines EE. The calculation method to determine EE was computerized to obtain new software (SD 2 P®, Spray Drying Parameter Simulation & Determination). From the desorption curve, the software SD 2 P® (Spray Drying Parameters Simulation & Determination) is a way, among others, to predict the value of these parameters when they are not known [2, 3]. The combined results provide more precise determination of spray-drying parameters (including inlet/outlet air temperature, mass/powder flow rate, powder temperature, etc.), powder state during spray-drying (stickiness) and the cost of spray-drying with respect to weather conditions (Fig 2). Several cases will be presented to show the interest of this strategy in order to anticipate the spray-drying parameters and the powder behavior...|$|E

The results correlate well with literature data indicating that the present method is a rapid way of assessing mould activity {{as a function of}} <b>water</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

The most important variance components for the calibration factor CFdA, which used {{the average of the}} measured calibration source activity over the three time points, were the inter-calibration source (77 %), intra-calibration source (14 %), and background count rate components (9 %). Approximately 54 % of this intra-calibration source variation was explained by variance due to Poisson noise, which could be reduced by longer calibration source image acquisition times or higher calibration source activities. The use of the average of the calibration source activity decreased the standard deviation of the calibration factor to 1.8 %, a 23 % reduction, and decreased the effect of radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> variability on the calibration factor estimate. This indicates that the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> should not be considered as a simple fixed effect but as a combination of fixed and random effects. A part of the random component {{may be due to the}} variable positioning of the calibration source inside the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> leading to variability of the calibration source activity measurement [15]. The remaining variance in the intra-calibration source component may be due to the variability of the bed speed during the whole-body acquisition, the calibration source position in the camera field of view, the calibration source position on the bed, or variations in the distance between the calibration source and the detectors. Imprecision or inaccuracy in the manually recorded time of the calibration source activity measurement or unsynchronized clocks between the radionuclide <b>activity</b> <b>meter</b> and the camera may also explain some of this intra-calibration source variance component.|$|R
