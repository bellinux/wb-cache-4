5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E

It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man seeks Gibson Praise, who is {{undergoing}} brain surgery {{at that very}} moment. Mulder and Scully head to the home where the alien gestated, finding an alien's nail in the wall. The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is in the nuclear power plant.

The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was probably manufactured in Armenia or Persia around 400 BC.

25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|Kitchener warned French in January 1915 {{that the}} Western Front was a siege line {{that could not}} be breached, in the context of Cabinet discussions about amphibious {{landings}} on the Baltic or North Sea Coast, or against Turkey. In an effort {{to find a way to}} relieve pressure on the Western front, Lord Kitchener proposed an invasion of Alexandretta with Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), New Army, and Indian troops. Alexandretta was an area with a large Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Ottoman Empire's railway network— its capture would have cut the empire in two. Yet he was instead eventually persuaded to support Winston Churchill's disastrous Gallipoli Campaign in 1915–1916. (Churchill's responsibility for the failure of this campaign is debated; for more information see David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace.) That failure, combined with the Shell Crisis of 1915– amidst press publicity engineered by Sir John French– dealt Kitchener's political reputation a heavy blow; Kitchener was popular with the public, so Asquith retained him in office in the new coalition government, but responsibility for munitions was moved to a new ministry headed by David Lloyd George. He was a sceptic about the tank, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was developed under the auspices of Churchill’s Admiralty.|$|E

The military related texts which were translated into Manchu from Chinese were translated by Dahai. Manchu {{translations of}} Chinese texts included the Ming penal code and military texts were performed by Dahai. These translations were requested of Dahai by Nurhaci. The military text Wu-tzu was translated into Manchu along with Sun-Tzu's work The Art of War.

While it was mainly administrative and ethical guidance which made up most of San-lüeh and Su Shu, military science was indeed found in the Liu-t'ao and Chinese military manuals were eagerly translated by the Manchus and the Manchus were also attracted to the military content in Romance of the Three Kingdoms <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was translated.|$|E

The storyline started not long after Guerrero and Bucanero {{defeated}} Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in mid-2002 and originally centered around Los Guerreros championship, with Shocker and Vampiro chasing the title. The two teams met {{in one of the}} feature matches at the CMLL 69th Anniversary Show where Los Guerreros successfully defended the tag team title. Following the title defense the storyline split into two, with Último Guerrero focusing on Shocker, demanding a match for Shocker's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. In the other storyline the feud between Bucanero and Vampiro focused more on a Lucha de Apuestas or bet match challenge. Since neither held a singles championship they would both bet their hair against the outcome of the match and be shaved bald in case they lost. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was chosen over the championship match to main event the show. In the semi-main event Último Guerrero won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after forcing Shocker to submit to his own trademark submission hold La Reienera (a Modified spinning backbreaker rack). In the main event Vampiro gained a measure of revenge for his tag team partner as he defeated Rey Bucanero, pinning him to win the third and deciding fall. Following the match Bucanero's long hair was cut off and then the rest of his hair was shaved off as per the Lucha Libre traditions.|$|E
