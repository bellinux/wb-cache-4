40|$|Weathering {{steel is}} {{commonly}} used as a cost-effective alternative for bridge superstructures, as the costs and environmental impacts associated with the maintenance/replacement of paint coatings are theoretically eliminated. The performance <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> depends on the proper formation of a surface patina, which consists of a dense layer of corrosion product used to protect the steel from further atmospheric corrosion. The development <b>of</b> the <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> patina may be hindered by environmental factors such as humid environments, wetting/drying cycles, sheltering, exposure to de-icing chlorides, and design details that permit water to pond on steel surfaces. Weathering steel bridges constructed over or adjacent to other roadways could be subjected to sufficient salt spray that would impede {{the development of an}} adequate patina. Addressing areas of corrosion on a weathering steel bridge superstructure where a protective patina has not formed is often costly and negates the anticipated cost savings for this type <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> superstructure. Early detection <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> corrosion is important to extending the service life of the bridge structure; however, written inspection procedures are not available for inspectors to evaluate the performance or quality of the patina.

While this is a commonly accepted criterion for placement on the register, preservationists must also determine the building's historical and/or aesthetic significance.

Consideration of the building's historic significance requires what preservationist David Fixler suggests is a rethinking of [...] "traditional notions of architectural conservation" [...] concerning modern buildings. For example, the natural <b>weathering</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> roof requires a value placed on what John Ruskin calls the [...] "golden stain of time." [...] While most preservationists value the patina of a copper roof, the concept must extend to an industrial steel roof in this case.

40|$|International audienceWeathering steel was {{designed}} to resist against the atmospheric impact due {{to the development of}} a characteristic rust layer that protects the metal by reducing the corrosion rate. This rust layer is formed by different iron (oxy-hydr) oxides that acts as a barrier and provides the protective ability. In order to check the conservation state trough the protective capability, it is necessary to calculate the so-called protective ability index (PAI). It mainly takes into account the ratio (α/γ) between the mass of goethite (α-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), present in the rust layer <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> <b>steel.</b> Raman spectroscopy, apart from a qualitative technique, is recently becoming a semi quantitative approach. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for the calculation of the mentioned index. This paper is a widening of a previous work in which it was uncovered a problem in different weathering steel sculptures which are exposed to a Cl− and SO 2 -rich urban atmosphere because they present different esthetical problems on their surfaces, such as detachments <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> chips, discolorations and irregularities. In order to relate these problems on the surface and the rust layer composition, PAI calculations were performed from the phase identification obtained from Raman imaging and using spectra decomposition to quantify each compounds. Although goethite and lepidocrocite were the most commonly detected compounds, hematite, akaganeite and magnetite were also identified. Hematite is a sub product formed in rich SO 2 atmospheres; therefore, a PAI with its content is proposed. Protective indexes obtained for the different artworks exposed in different places provide quantitative clues for the conservation diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> structures...|$|R
