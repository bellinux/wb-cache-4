40|$|Hypopituitarism {{can present}} with {{psychiatric}} symptoms. We report a unique case of psychosis in clear consciousness {{in a case}} of hypopituitarism due to the secondary empty sella syndrome following a Russell's viper bite which was untreated and presented with psychotic symptoms for past 13 years following the snake bite. After the diagnosis of psychosis due to hypopituitarism was made, the patient was treated with levothyroxine and prednisolone supplements and his psychotic symptoms subsided without any psychotropic drugs. Vasculotoxic snake bites can <b>cause</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> and can present with psychosis. Further research will be needed into the prevalence of this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Background. Shock {{syndrome}} is an acute tissue hypoperfusion. Early diagnosis and adequate symptomatic and causal treatment are mandatory. In spite of different etiologies (dehidration, bleeding, heart failure, sepsis), clinical signs and symptomes are similar (hypotension, tachicardia, tachipnoe, pallor, {{cold and wet}} skin, oliguria and metabolic acidosis). Rarely, the shock {{syndrome is}} the consequence of the adrenal insufficiency due to <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>caused</b> by brain tumor where early treatment with hydrocortisone is urgent. Methods. This article presents a patient with a shock syndrome and multiorgan failure. Endocrinological testing and brain CT demonstrated an endocrinologically inactive tumor of hypophysis. The tumor was growing into adjacent hypophyseal tissue and <b>causing</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> with secondary hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency and deficit of both gonadotropins and growth hormone. Conclusions. Primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency are among rare causes of shock syndrome. Whenever it is suspected, estimation of serum levels of cortisol and ACTH is necessary and immediate treatment with hydrocortisone should be instituted. </p...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is {{recognized}} as a <b>cause</b> of <b>hypopituitarism</b> even after mild TBI. Although over the past decade, {{a growing body of}} research has detailed neuroendocrine changes induced by TBI, the mechanisms and risk factors responsible for this pituitary dysfunction are still unclear. Around the world, sports-especially combative sports-are very popular. However, sports are not generally considered as a cause of TBI in most epidemiological studies, and the link between sports-related head trauma and hypopituitarism has not been investigated until recently. Thus, there is a paucity of data regarding this important concern. Because of the large number of young sports participants with near-normal life expectancy, the implications of undiagnosed or untreated postconcussion pituitary dysfunction can be dramatic. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors of <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>caused</b> by sports injuries is thus an important issue that concerns both medical staff and sponsors of sports. The aim of this paper was to summarize the best evidence for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms and to discuss the current data and recommendations on sports-related head trauma as a <b>cause</b> of <b>hypopituitarism...</b>|$|R
40|$|UDDEN headache, vision loss, and ophthalmoplegia from {{pituitary}} hemorrhage or infarction characterize pituitary apoplexy, 1, 3, 6 – 8 and MR imaging of {{the brain}} often demonstrates a pituitary mass with heterogeneous sig-nal due {{to the presence of}} blood. 7 Apoplexy typically occurs in a previously unrecognized pituitary adenoma, but it can also occur when the pituitary gland is normal. Various pre-cipitating factors have been reported including medication, radiotherapy, surgery, anticoagulation therapy, head trauma, and pregnancy. 1, 6 Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disor-der of the pituitary gland, occurring more often in women.

40|$|Sheehan′s {{syndrome}} (SS) is postpartum <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>caused</b> by necrosis of the pituitary gland. It {{is usually}} the result of severe hypotension or shock caused by massive hemorrhage during or after delivery. Patients with SS have varying degrees of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. Its frequency is decreasing worldwide {{and it is a}} rare <b>cause</b> of <b>hypopituitarism</b> in developed countries owing to advances in obstetric care. However, it is still frequent in underdeveloped and developing countries. SS often evolves slowly and hence is diagnosed late. History of postpartum hemorrhage, failure to lactate and cessation of menses are important clues to the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important to reduce morbidity and mortality of the patients...|$|R
40|$|A 32 -year-old woman, a 73 -year-old {{man and a}} 26 -year-old {{pregnant}} woman presented with headache, vomiting, and variable presence of visual disturbances, impaired consciousness, and circulatory shock. All three had pituitary apoplexy. In the first patient lymphocytic hypophysitis was diagnosed, the second had a nonfunctional adenoma and the last patient probably also. All three patients were treated conservatively with full recovery of signs and symptoms. However pituitary insufficiency remained in all three. Pituitary apoplexy is an acute event with significant morbidity and mortality. The cause is a rapid expansion of, usually, a pre-existing, often not yet known, adenoma by massive haemorrhage or infarction. Pressure, among other things, <b>causes</b> <b>hypopituitarism,</b> meningism, compression of the chiasma opticum and visual disturbances. Although many predisposing factors have been identified, pituitary apoplexy is often an unpredictable event. Diagnosis is made by the typical clinical presentation, eye examination, MRI and by measuring pituitary hormones. Treatment is with suppletion of the deficient hormones and in selected patients by transsphenoidal decompression surgery...|$|R
40|$|Sheehan’s syndrome, {{which is}} {{pituitary}} necrosis after severe postpartum hemorrhage and hypovolemia, may <b>cause</b> <b>hypopituitarism</b> immediately or several years later, {{depending on the}} degree of tissue destruction. We report an unusual case, in which a 55 -year-old woman with Sheehan's syndrome got worse symptoms after spontaneous labor. In 1998, she had severe postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis during the third delivery, thus it was diagnosed as Sheehan’s syndrome by clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and magnetic resonance imaging. She was treated by replacement therapy including hydrocortisone and levothyroxine sodium. However, she had the fourth spontaneous pregnancy in 2000 and got worse symptoms after delivery. We carefully concluded that pregnancy provided no evidence against the diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome because pregnancy might improve hypopituitarism by stimulating the pituitary remnant to undergo hyperplasia and irritating the placenta to secrete hormone. However, pregnancy might aggravate the symptoms by inducing autoimmunity as well. All in all, early diagnosis and adequate medical treatment are important to provide a good prognosis of Sheehan’s syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{most common}} <b>cause</b> of <b>hypopituitarism</b> is {{pituitary}} adenoma. However, {{in the case}} of suprasellar masses different etiologies are possible. We report an unusual case of primary suprasellar lymphoma presented with hypopituitarism. Case presentation A 26 year old woman presented with amenorrhea, galactorrhea and neurological disorders. Also, the laboratory work-up revealed partial hypopituitarism. The magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed a suprasellar mass. A presumptive diagnosis of granulomatous processes was made and the patient was given steroid therapy. Repeated brain MRI detected new lesions in the brain with regression of the suprasellar mass. Stereotactic biopsy of the paraventricular lesion revealed the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. Conclusion This case presentation reports a rare <b>cause</b> of <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Primary suprasellar lymphoma is extremely rare and represented a real diagnostic challenge. Besides, suprasellar masses are varied in aetiology and can present diagnostic problems for a radiologist. Also, because of the increased incidence of PCNSL, lymphoma must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of lesions in the suprasellar region. </p...|$|R
