500|$|At 16:56, Taylor {{was again}} asked {{to turn on}} his {{transmitter}} for YG if he had one. He did not acknowledge but {{a few minutes later}} advised his flight [...] "Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes." [...] About the same time someone in the flight said [...] "Dammit, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> fly west we would get home; head west, dammit." [...] This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own. It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline.|$|E
2500|$|Bergman cited {{his desire}} to one day perform in Graceland as another {{influence}} on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he {{would one day be}} able to perform there. Bergman commented [...] "I used to sit in my bedroom and think, 'Damn, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single [...] "They Live".|$|E
2500|$|Temperley {{revealed}} in a mid-September, pre-album release {{interview that the}} band felt [...] "dusty" [...] following the decreased popularity of Ghosts of the Past. He explained, [...] "We needed a third party to come in so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be a band" [...] and stated that the band was motivated to hire producer Burke Reid after {{he admitted that he}} was not a fan of their music. Temperley also provided insight into the album's musical influences, citing Leonard Cohen and stating, [...] "I always refer back to the sounds I have always loved and for me Beck and LCD Soundsystem are where it's at." [...] Two synthesizers that belonged to Temperley, a Jupiter 4 and a Roland Compurhythm 100, were used during the entire recording process.|$|E

I think we did all <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> <b>We</b> <b>just</b> came up a tiny bit short." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin John Coyne, {{reviewing}} the song for Country Universe, {{gave it a}} B rating. He says that Keith makes [...] "a surprisingly earnest attempt to soften his image, wishing <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>just</b> agree to disagree before our debates turn to angry words, and praying for peace on earth, even though war is sometimes necessary." ...|$|R
2500|$|Past {{comments}} {{came back}} to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think this country {{would be better off}} if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a Johnson television commercial, as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary, and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, Ed Droste {{described}} Shields as Grizzly Bear's [...] "most verbose album" [...] yet, noting, [...] "It's funny, because I {{think back}} to a song like [...] "Colorado", where I was basically singing ten words {{over and over again}} for five minutes straight – and that's it. There's nothing on this album like that. There's a lot more there, verbally, and it's definitely emotionally charged." [...] Bassist and producer, Chris Taylor stated, [...] "For this record, it was really important to us to try and make sure that lyrics had a weight to them and at least some sense of a narrative, even if it was loose. There were lyrics in previous albums that seemed to have no meaning whatsoever. And that always really annoyed me. We agreed it'd be really important and awesome if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> try and make all the lyrics tell something. [...] I was definitely able to use lyrics as a frame to how I would let the arrangements build and then fall away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zaghba (born 1995 in Fez, Morocco) was at {{the time}} of the attack living in east London where he worked in a fast food outlet. He also worked at an Islamic {{television}} channel in London. Zaghba was born to a Moroccan Muslim father and an Italian Catholic Christian mother who had converted to Islam to marry. Zaghba had dual Moroccan and Italian nationality. When his parents divorced, he went to Italy with his mother. In 2016, Zaghba was stopped at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by Italian officers who found ISIS-related materials on his mobile phone; he was stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Italian authorities said Zaghba was monitored continuously while in Italy and that the UK was informed about him. Giuseppe Amato, an Italian prosecutor, said [...] "We did our best. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> monitor and surveil... and send a note to British authorities, that's all we could do and we did it. Since he moved to London, he came back to Italy once in a while for a total of 10 days. And during those 10 days we never let him out of our sight." ...|$|E

5000|$|Around 1942, Göring's art agent Sepp Angerer, and {{the local}} German consul Gerhard Wolf, went {{on a tour of}} Contini-Bonacossi's collection.

2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do. At this point, the reader will appreciate the vacuity of the EMH argument.|$|E

5000|$|Aili Jõgi has {{described}} why the two schoolgirls blew up a monument they considered {{a symbol of}} occupation and repression:"How long should we watch this red star, a memorial for Russian looters. At the time when all our statues are being destroyed. We just couldn't get our heads around it. We decided that if such robbers are raging in Estonia, they should see how one of their memorials gets blown up. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> doused the wooden thing with gasoline and set fire to it, but we wanted it {{to go with a}} bang!" ...|$|R

[...] "Road signs were always masked and replaced with period signage.

2500|$|If {{war broke}} out, we {{would then be}} able to clear the entire central Galilee with one fell swoop. But we cannot empty the central Galilee - that is, {{including}} the [...] refugees - without a war going on. The Galilee is full of [...] residents; it is not an empty region. If war breaks out throughout the entire country, this would be advantageous for us as far as the Galilee is concerned because, without having to make any major effort - <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use <b>just</b> enough of the force required for the purpose without weakening our military efforts {{in other parts of the}} country - <b>we</b> <b>could</b> empty the Galilee completely.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, daddy, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> have an orchard!" [...] she {{had been}} wont to say wistfully, when other farmhouses in White Sands were smothered whitely in apple bloom.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to Winkler and Hanson, the band asked other musicians {{to be involved}} with the writing of several songs. [...] Winkler said that [...] "We went around and wrote with anybody <b>we</b> <b>could</b> think of, <b>just</b> {{to see what would happen}} and to get a different vibe.

500|$|Lucian Pintilie himself {{notes that}} Dumitriu's book, {{authored}} during the internationalist stage of communism, and before nationalism made a comeback with {{the rule of}} Nicolae Ceauşescu, is valid as a critique of interwar realities. According to Doinel Tronaru, the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial, and {{seen by many as}} [...] "indigestible". Tronaru writes: [...] "the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict, but Pintilie is telling us [...] not to tune out believing we are somehow better, that, if need be, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be <b>just</b> as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors." ...|$|R
5000|$|With The Room, {{the goal}} was [...] "to make the best iOS game <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> not <b>just</b> {{try to make a}} big console game for iOS", {{according}} to Fireproofs' Barry Meade. They wanted to emphasise the use of the touchscreen of mobile devices in its own unique way, similar to the success of Cut the Rope and Angry Birds. At the same time, they wanted to create a game that would be immersive for the player, and had devised the appropriate touch controls to provide tactile responses that worked alongside their art and music assets to help towards this.|$|R
