5|$|An era in {{the history}} of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of Camulos bade {{farewell}} to the homestead <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lived in successive generations since Antonio del Valle. It was the passing of the old regime.

5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered. If they do not catch any food, they will enter a torpor similar to hibernation that day, awakening at night to hunt again.|$|E

The Legion seizes Hoover Dam, forcing the NCR to retreat, allowing Caesar's Legion to gain control over New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland.|$|E

5|$|Many Phellodon {{species are}} {{known from the}} southeastern United States, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been {{extensively}} researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct Phellodon species from Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains.

5|$|Several bear {{species are}} {{dangerous}} to humans, especially in areas <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans.

5|$|The United States is {{a melting}} pot {{consisting}} of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music. Some nationalities have produced local scenes in {{regions of the country}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> clustered, like Cape Verdean music in New England, Armenian music in California, and Italian and Ukrainian music in New York City.|$|E

They are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Metroid: Other M, it was {{reported}} to have a bug where the door in Sector 3 is permanently locked and impassable, preventing players from continuing. Nintendo revealed that a bug is triggered when the player backtracks to the room within Sector 3 <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> previously obtained the Ice Beam. The company has set up a program that allows players affected by the bug to send in an SD card or their Wii console with their save files to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found food before.|$|E
