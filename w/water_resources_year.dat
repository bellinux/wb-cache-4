The spatial variation of the temporal distribution characteristics and the temporal variation of the spatial distribution characteristics were both analyzed. In addition, the relationships between the numerical characteristics of the cloud model of temporal and spatial distributions of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> and precipitation were also studied. The results show that, using a cloud model, it is possible to intuitively describe the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> in cloud images. <b>Water</b> <b>resources</b> in Guangdong Province and their temporal and spatial distribution characteristics are differentiated by their geographic locations.

Water supply security (WSS), which {{is the state of}} <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> and their capacity and their capacity to meet the demand of water users by water supply systems, {{is an important part of}} water security. Currently, WSS is affected by the amount of <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>water</b> supply projects, water quality and water management. Water shortages have also led to water supply insecurity.

2500|$|Hydrologists today {{typically}} assess {{water scarcity}} {{by looking at}} the population-water equation. This is done by comparing the amount of total available <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> per <b>year</b> to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> available per person.

At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces [...] "water scarcity". The United Nations' FAO states that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. The World Bank adds that climate change could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and use, thereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity, both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Increasing {{national}} and international interest in <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> in recent <b>years</b> has stimulated much new activity and progress in hydrology. It is now generally recognized that the science of hydrology is basic {{to an understanding of}} <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> problems and to planning for <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> development. Accompanying this demand upon the science of hydrology is an urgent need for improved education at the university level. In resopnse to this need for improved education, the First International Seminar for Hydrology Professors was held at Urbana, Illinois, in July 1969. The Second International Seminar was held at Logan, Utah, during August 2 - 14, 1970, and was a continuation of the program to acquaint hydrology professors with modern concepts and technologies. The major overall objective of the second seminar was to emphasize the systems approach as applied to hydrology, in which the various fundamental hydrologic processes and their interrelationships were studied and examined. Because of the need to apply new concepts and technologies to the development and utilization of the limited supply of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> throughout the world, hydrologic programs in our colleges and universities generally require much improvement, particularly with reference to the application of systems concepts and methods. Accordingly, the specific objectives of the Seminar were as follows: 1. To impress upon hydrology professors the improtance of the systems approach to the science of hydrology, and to acquaint them with the fundamental and basic concepts of the the hydrologic system. 2. To present concepts for defining or describing the hydrologic system in terms of particular management objectives. 3. To examine various techniques for monitoring the hydrologic system, including the design of monitoring networks in terms of particular objectives. 4. To acquaint the participants with several methods of modeling hydrologic systems, and to provide them with experiences which demonstrate the utility of modeling for (a) examining various system interrelationships and sensitivies; and (b) maximizing particular objective functions subject to given external contraints and production functions...|$|R

Comprehensive <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> assessment is the conventional assessment where the frequency distribution of <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> in basins or provincial regions are analyzed. For the annual <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> assessment, <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> {{of the last year}} in basins or provincial regions are usually assessed. For the industrial project <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> assessment, the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> situation before the construction of industrial project has to be assessed. To address the climate and environmental changes, hydrological and statistical models are widely applied for studies on assessing <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> changes. For the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> prediction in China usually the monthly runoff prediction is used. In most low flow seasons, the flow recession curve is commonly used as prediction method. In the humid regions, the rainfall-runoff ensemble prediction (ESP) has been widely applied for the monthly runoff prediction. The conditional probability method for the monthly runoff prediction was also applied to assess next month runoff probability under a fixed initial condition...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} very {{useful in the}} process of {{desalination}} especially for areas that suffer from a lack of clean <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> In recent <b>years,</b> many people have been using solar still. Therefore the raising of the productivity and efficiency of solar still represents the most important problems that need further research. The present work aims to study the effect of preheating the water en-tering to still and the effect of reducing pressure inside the still on the productivity of the solar still. Therefore in present work two identical single basin typical double slope solar stills of the inner basin dimensions for each still 2 m × 1 m × 0. 08 m, have been designed and fabricated with mild steel plate. One of them is conventional solar still and the other is modified with flat plate collector and vacuum pump to study the effect of preheating and vacuum on the performance of solar still. The experimental measurements are made to enhance the solar still productivity by firstly preheating the water entering the still using flat plate collector and secondly by integratin...|$|R

The sustainable development is defined as supply objectives and needs of today without jeopardizing objectives and demands of future generations.
