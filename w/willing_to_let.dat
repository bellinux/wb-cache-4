5|$|Mido {{eventually}} {{signed for}} Roma {{on the final}} day of the 2004 summer transfer window, for a fee of €6million, signing a five-year contract. It was confirmed that he would miss the opening game of the season, and possibly the following two games. Mido was penciled in to make his Roma debut against Messina in September 2004, a game in which he did actually play, but Roma lost 4–3. Reports suggested that Mido could be sold to Valencia in a swap deal with Bernardo Corradi and was also linked with a move to Premier League side Manchester City. Southampton were believed to have had Mido on their shortlist of targets, but his agent Christophe Henrotay said Roma would not be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Mido leave the club. It was even reported that he had been offered to Southampton on loan but his new agent, Mino Raiola, repeated the earlier claims that Roma wanted to keep Mido until, at least, the end of the season. He was linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, with his agent confirming he wanted a move away from Roma.|$|E
5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
25|$|A {{surge of}} {{national}} unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.|$|E

25|$|When {{it comes}} to {{contracts}} where one party disputed whether it had been properly formed, rather than the validity of a formed contract, the Court has been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> a court decide the issue. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for a unanimous court in First Options v. Kaplan that upheld a district-court decision reversing an arbitration award where {{it was not clear}} that the respondents had agreed to submit the arbitrability of the question to the arbitrator.|$|E
25|$|However, the peloton {{proved to}} stay {{together}} all the way until the Champs-Élysées, except for brief escapes to nab the final intermediate sprint and two small climbs. Tradition held up; Discovery successfully led Contador onto the famous street before the sprinting began. Freddy Bichot briefly got away on the second circuit. Chris Horner of Cadel Evans' Predictor-Lotto team tried to get away soon after, but the peloton was much less <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him leave. When Alejandro Valverde and Axel Merckx counter-attacked Bichot {{to bring him back}} into the field, Discovery faded back.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae also earns a {{significant}} portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its single-family Fannie Mae MBS and on the single-family mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio. Investors, or purchasers of Fannie Mae MBSs, are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Fannie Mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk; that is, Fannie Mae's guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults.|$|E

25|$|Though Hitler hated Jewish {{people and}} wanted them {{expelled}} from Germany, in 1933 the Nazis were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> {{a large number}} of Jewish refugees flee to the surrounding nations. This was because Reich officials were concerned that fleeing Jewish refugees would lend large numbers to a growing international movement for the economic boycott of Germany. Adding to Hitler's worries, German financial advisers warned the Nazi government that a mass exodus of Jewish laborers from the German workforce would badly damage Germany's economic stability. The Nazis needed a convenient solution to rid themselves of Jews without a political or economic backlash.|$|E
25|$|Public furore {{attracted}} interest of various other would-be inventors {{who wanted to}} demonstrate their own death rays to the War Office. None of them were convincing. On 28 May Commander Kenworthy asked in the House of Commons what the government intended to do to stop Matthews from selling the ray to a foreign power. The Under Secretary for Air answered that Matthews was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them investigate the ray to their satisfaction. A government representative also stated that one ministry official had stood before the ray and survived. Newspapers continued to root for Matthews.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{the time}} that Straffen was in prison, the Home Secretary had to agree to the release of any life {{sentence}} prisoner; no occupant of the office was ever <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Straffen out. In 1994, Michael Howard decided to compile a select list of about 20 prisoners serving life sentences who must never be released, and Straffen's name was said to be on it. The whole list was published by the News of the World in December 1997; this report confirmed that Straffen would indeed {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Nicholas Balabkins {{notes that}} the Allied restrictions placed on German steel production, and their control over where the produced coal and steel was delivered, meant that offers by Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed German coal and machinery were rejected. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of lard a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. The Allies were however not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the Germans trade.|$|E
25|$|Though Messier was {{actually}} {{under contract to}} the Oilers until 1993, his agent and father Doug Messier unsuccessfully pressed Sather for a new deal {{in the summer of}} 1990. After the 1990–91 season, Messier was upset that the Oilers were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Adam Graves leave the team. Messier issued a public trade demand during the Canada Cup tournament saying that he wanted out if the Oilers were not willing to do what was necessary to keep important players. On October 4, 1991, in one of many cost-cutting moves by Edmonton management, Messier was traded to the New York Rangers for Louie DeBrusk, Bernie Nicholls, and Steven Rice.|$|E
25|$|At age 20, Nguyen {{acted on}} her {{interest}} in rock music and started looking for bands <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Beyond Betty Jean eventually broke up and Nguyen started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and wrote music. Later, she became the lead singer of a band called Jealousy, which released a few songs online before breaking up. In 2003, Nguyen was a contestant on VH1's Surviving Nugent, a reality TV show where participants performed compromising tasks and stunts for rock star Ted Nugent.|$|E

25|$|NBC got its {{chance in}} the late 1980s, when Kohlberg Kravis Roberts put CBS {{affiliate}} WTVJ (then on channel 4, now on channel 6) on the market. NBC's then-corporate parent General Electric purchased that station in 1987, but WTVJ's affiliation contract with CBS was not set to expire until December 1988. CBS was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> WTVJ out of its contract one year early. However, Ed Ansin {{was not interested in}} letting NBC out of its affiliation agreement with WSVN, which also expired at the same time; Ansin even made an unsuccessful petition to the FCC to stop NBC's purchase of WTVJ. He wanted channel 7 to air NBC's strong fall 1988 lineup, which included the Major League Baseball World Series and the Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Where Michael is concerned, Fiona is {{not entirely}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of their past relationship, which {{continues}} to simmer. In {{the latter half of}} season 3, it is shown {{that the two of them}} are close to reigniting their relationship. As season 5 starts, the two move in together, but tension in their romantic relationship remains. However, she is accused of the British Consulate bombings as the antagonist Anson Fullerton tricks her into confessing to a crime she did not commit. Anson uses this leverage over Michael and forces him to do work for himself. To remove this leverage, Fiona eventually surrenders and is arrested by the FBI as Michael watches in vain. In the series finale, she and Michael are living happily and raising Charlie as their son.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} a screenplay for The Terminator, Cameron {{decided to sell}} it {{so that he could}} direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures, which was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him direct. Gale Anne Hurd, who had started her own production company, Pacific Western Productions, had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as a producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. Orion Pictures distributed the film. Hurd and Cameron were married from 1985 to 1989.|$|E

25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking his collar bone. Not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him go on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E
25|$|In August 1946, Torsten Nilsson {{suggested}} merging Aerotransport and SILA, {{but this}} had been rejected by both companies. A meeting was held on 28 May 1947 with the main owners of SILA, where Nilsson proposed a 50–50 state–private ownership in a merged company. While both parties saw the advantage of merging to rationalize operations, neither party was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the other receive the chair. At the time, Aerotransport had just ordered ten DC-6 and was planning to start intercontinental flights to Africa and Asia. The minister appointed Torsten Nothin to lead a board to make a recommendation, and then negotiate with SILA's owners for a merger. One issue was that the Swedes perceived that the privately owned DDL and DNL would not agree with a nationalization of SILA. The Swedish government chose not to contact the two other social democratic Scandinavian governments about partially nationalizing their own flag carriers.|$|E
25|$|After {{she almost}} kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it {{and goes to}} Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie {{that she wants to}} get back {{together}} with him, but he tells her that he is not ready as {{he does not want to}} hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and they talk about the past and the future. Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to make a statement about Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son. Later, a content Kat returns to Walford and tells Stacey and Alfie that she has finally made her peace with the past and is no longer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Harry control her.|$|E
