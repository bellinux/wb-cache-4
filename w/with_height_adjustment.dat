40|$|OBJECTIVES: Height is {{inversely}} {{associated with}} cardiovascular disease mortality risk and has shown variable associations with cancer incidence and mortality. The {{interpretation of findings}} from previous studies has been constrained by data limitations. Associations between height and specific causes of death were investigated in a large general population cohort {{of men and women}} from the West of Scotland. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Renfrew and Paisley, in the West of Scotland. SUBJECTS: 7052 men and 8354 women aged 45 - 64 were recruited into a study in Renfrew and Paisley, in the West of Scotland, between 1972 and 1976. Detailed assessments of cardiovascular disease risk factors, morbidity and socioeconomic circumstances were made at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths during 20 years of follow up classified into specific causes. RESULTS: Over the follow up period 3347 men and 2638 women died. Height is inversely associated with all cause, coronary heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease mortality among men and women. Adjustment for socioeconomic position and cardiovascular risk factors had little influence on these associations. Height is strongly associated with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and adjustment for FEV 1 considerably attenuated the association between height and cardiorespiratory mortality. Smoking related cancer mortality is not associated with height. The risk of deaths from cancer unrelated to smoking tended to increase with height, particularly for haematopoietic, colorectal and prostate cancers. Stomach cancer mortality was inversely associated <b>with</b> <b>height.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> for socioeconomic position had little influence on these associations. CONCLUSION: Height serves partly as an indicator of socioeconomic circumstances and nutritional status in childhood and this may underlie the inverse associations between height and adulthood cardiorespiratory mortality. Much of the association between height and cardiorespiratory mortality was accounted for by lung function, which is also partly determined by exposures acting in childhood. The inverse association between height and stomach cancer mortality probably reflects Helicobacter pylori infection in childhood resulting inor being associated withshorter height. The positive associations between height and several cancers unrelated to smoking could reflect the influence of calorie intake during childhood on the risk of these cancers...|$|E

30|$|The {{accurate}} {{control for}} the vehicle <b>height</b> and leveling <b>adjustment</b> system of an electronic air suspension (EAS) still is a challenging problem {{that has not been}} effectively solved in prior researches. This paper proposes a new adaptive controller to control the vehicle height and to adjust the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body (leveling control) during the vehicle <b>height</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedures by an EAS system. A nonlinear mechanism model of the full-car vehicle <b>height</b> <b>adjustment</b> system is established to reflect the system dynamic behaviors and to derive the system optimal control law. To deal with the nonlinear characters in the vehicle <b>height</b> and leveling <b>adjustment</b> processes, the nonlinear system model is globally linearized through the state feedback method. On this basis, a fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) is designed to improve the control accuracy of the vehicle <b>height</b> <b>adjustment</b> and to reduce the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method more accurately, the full-car EAS system model programmed using AMESim is also given. Then, the co-simulation study of the FSMC performance can be conducted. Finally, actual vehicle tests are performed with a city bus, and the test results illustrate that the vehicle <b>height</b> <b>adjustment</b> performance is effectively guaranteed by the FSMC, and the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body during the vehicle <b>height</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedures are also reduced significantly. This research proposes an effective control methodology for the vehicle <b>height</b> and leveling <b>adjustment</b> system of an EAS, which provides a favorable control performance for the system.|$|R

The methodology allows designers to generate sub modules and creates relationships or network between these modules to form to functional structure of the design.
