In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

5000|$|Simplicity {{boils down}} to two steps: Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest. Leo Babauta Some people {{practice}} simple living by reducing consumption. By lowering expenditure on goods or services, the time spent earning money can be reduced. The time saved {{may be used to}} pursue other interests, or help others through volunteering. Some may use the extra free time to improve their quality of life, for example pursuing creative activities such as art and crafts. Developing a detachment from money has led some individuals, such as Suelo and Mark Boyle, to live with no money at all. Reducing expenses may also lead to increasing savings, which can lead to financial independence and the possibility of early retirement.
