40|$|As {{interest}} {{in the use of}} supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO 2) in power cycles increases, it is important to determine if commonly used design and analysis techniques are applicable to S-CO 2. The thermophysical properties of S-CO 2 can vary greatly, especially near the pseudo-critical point. This can result in large property variations through process equipment such as heat exchangers, particularly at low temperatures. Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation (BMPC) is currently operating a 100 kW closed Brayton test loop using S-CO 2 as the working fluid. The Integrated Systems Test (IST) loop contains two shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or precooler, consists of two units with the S-CO 2 on the shell side and chilled water counter flowing through the tubes. The Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX), which serves as the heat source, has the S-CO 2 flowing though the tubes and a heated mineral oil heat transfer fluid on the shell side. These heat exchangers were modeled with Xist ® shell-and-tube heat exchanger design software from the Heat Transfer Research Institute (HTRI). Heat transfer data from IST operations are compared to model predictions and conclusions are made as to the applicability of this tool for S-CO 2 analysis. BACKGROUN...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOn {{industrial}} {{induction heating}} devices, induction coils are water cooled {{at a high}} flow rate: this {{large amount of energy}} (10 to 60 % of the total energy consumption) is often lost. A heat recovery test bench has been built to collect the coil losses and reuse them when needed. The main parts of the test bench are made up two heat exchangers which can be bypassed according to the control and regulation system. The " recovery heat exchanger " collects the heat to be recovered and transfers it to the reuse, the recovery circuit. The " <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> " evacuates the remained energy to ensure a safe use of the induction heating device. These two exchangers are designed for a 100 kW power transfer. A " Predictive Functional Control " (PFC) regulation has been implemented to drive the bench. This system is more efficient compared to a conventional PID controller. Thanks to a precise modeling of the bench parts and the induction device, it is possible to anticipate disturbances such as induction power fluctuations and to adapt the recovering in order to always work in a safe way.

The <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are {{to be used in}} the power plant for the purposes of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery, recuperation and intercooling. In selecting an optimum <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> for use, the PCHE was identified as the best candidate for <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery and recuperation. In order to ascertain the viability of this assertion the PCHE was designed and a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB using the conditions that the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> for <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery would be subjected to. The choice of using the conditions that the <b>waste</b> recovery <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> would be subjected to was due to the fact that, it is the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> that would be subjected to much harsh conditions (thus higher temperatures of up to 650 ºC). The PFHE was also designed and similarly a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB. The decision to consider the design of the PFHE was to offer a platform to compare and contrast the performance of the PCHE in order to have a strong basis for deciding on whether to stick to the choice for the PCHE or otherwise. The results obtained from the 1 D modeling of the design of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> indicates that the PCHE performed better with regards to pressure drops across the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> (with values of 1. 17 and 2. 47 % for the cold and hot sides respectively), compactness (with a value of 1300 m 2 /m 3 for the PCHE compared to the 855 m 2 /m 3 recorded from the PFHE), however the PFHE recorded higher heat transfer coefficients, and a subsequent higher overall transfer coefficient.

Lindgren came into service in 2010 and has since been primarily used for complex numeric simulations of fluid mechanics and computational chemistry and biology. The heat exchange system collects the <b>wasted</b> <b>heat</b> from Lindgren’s 36, 384 CPU cores and transfers it via the standard district heating and cooling system to a neighboring building which houses the Chemistry laboratories. We analyze the impact of Lindgren’s heat recycle system {{as a function of}} outside temperature and we estimate the system’s carbon emission savings. Since the original installation of Lindgren in 2010, it has become common practice to use water cooling systems for supercomputers, as water is a better heat transfer medium than air. We discuss the relevant design lessons from Lindgren as they relate to practical and sustainable <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery designs for today’s platforms. Finally, we estimate that the recovered heat from Lindgren reduced the carbon emissions by nearly 50 tons over the 2012 - 13 winter, the sample period of our analysis.

40|$|Momentum {{transport}} in porous media {{exists in}} numerous engineering and process appli-cations, e. g., ground water pollution, storage of nuclear <b>waste,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> and chemical reactors. In many of such applications, the porous medium is confined by solid boundaries. These impermeable boundaries {{give rise to}} shear stress and boundary layers. The Brinkman-extended Darcy equation describes the momentum transport due to Newto-nian fluid flow in confined porous media. This equation is solved analytically in a cylin-drical system, employing an existing fully-developed boundary-layer concept particular to porous media flows. The volume-averaged velocity increases as {{the distance from the}} boundary increases reaching a maximum at the center. The mean and maximum veloc-ities are obtained and their behavior is investigated in terms of pertinent flow parameters. The friction factor is defined based on the mean velocity and is found to be inversely pro-portional to the Reynolds number, the Darcy number, and the mean velocity. The analyti-cal results are verified by experiments using two types of metal foam. In the Darcy regime, reasonably good agreement is found between the analytical and the experimental friction factors for the 20 -pore-per-inch foam, while a poor agreement is found for the 10 -pore-per-inch foam.

This paper explains and discusses the simulation, performance, and successful applications of thermosyphon <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> (THE’s) for recovering <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from exhaust gases in industrial plants. The advantages of this system are compactness, flexibility of system size, ease of operation, and minimum maintenance requirements. The thermosyphon <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> can satisfactorily act as a pre-heater of air in boilers and furnaces using the heat recovered from the exhaust. In this work, one successful industrial practice is explained using thermosyphon <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The THE was simulated to recover <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> from the exhaust of a nearly 7 ton boiler in the SAMEN company. The energy recovered from the flue gas is used to preheat the incoming air to the boiler. The average rate of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery and thermal effectiveness obtained from computer simulation are 100 kW and 40 %, respectively. The payback period was less than two years. The evaluation of the thermal performance of the THE {{was based on the}} effectiveness-NTU and LMTD methods to obtain the heat transfer characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Many modern Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU) process <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> {{recovery}} <b>exchangers</b> {{operate in}} high temperature environments. These exchangers {{are associated with}} the thermal reactor system where the tubesheet/tube/ferrule assemblies are exposed to gasses at temperatures approaching 3000 °F. Because sulfur compounds are present in the process gas, the carbon steel tubesheet and tubes in the assembly will be deteriorated by sulfidation as the operating metal temperature rises above 600 o F. Ferrule systems are used to protect the carbon steel from exposure to excessive temperatures. The temperature distribution in the steel tubesheet/tube/ferrule system is affected by process gas flow and heat transfer through the assembly. Rather than depend upon “assumed ” heat transfer coefficients and fluid flow distribution, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) investigation was conducted to study the flow fields and heat transfer in the tubesheet assembly. It was found that the configuration of the ferrule installation has a large influence on the temperature distribution in the steel materials and, therefore, the possible sulfidation of the carbon steel parts...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{is equally}} {{important}} to power density or efficiency for the adoption of <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery thermoelectric generators (TEG) in many transportation and industrial energy recovery applications. In many cases the system design that minimizes cost (e. g., the $/W value) can be very different than the design that maximizes the system's efficiency or power density, {{and it is important}} to understand the relationship between those designs to optimize TEG performance-cost compromises. Expanding on recent cost analysis work and using more detailed system modeling, an enhanced cost scaling analysis of a <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery thermoelectric generator with more detailed, coupled treatment of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> has been performed. In this analysis, the effect of the heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the hot-side and cold-side conductances that maximize power output are considered. This coupled thermal and thermoelectric treatment of the exhaust <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> recovery thermoelectric generator yields modified cost scaling and design optimization equations, which are now strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, exhaust mass flow rate, and <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> effectiveness. This work shows that <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> costs most often dominate the overall TE system costs, that it is extremely difficult to escape this regime, and in order to achieve TE system costs of $ 1 /W it is necessary to achieve <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> costs of $ 1 /(W/K). Minimum TE system costs per watt generally coincide with maximum power points, but Preferred TE Design Regimes are identified where there is little cost penalty for moving into regions of higher efficiency and slightly lower power outputs. These regimes are closely tied to previously-identified low cost design regimes. This work shows that the optimum fill factor Fopt minimizing system costs decreases as heat losses increase, and increases as exhaust mass flow rate and <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> effectiveness increase. These findings have profound implications on the design and operation of various thermoelectric (TE) <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> 3 recovery systems. This work highlights the importance of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> costs on the overall TEG system costs, quantifies the possible TEG performance-cost domain space based on <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> effects, and provides a focus for future system research and development efforts...|$|R
