5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed it was the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and {{would continue to be}} offered.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, {{that it is the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E
500|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Johnson {{was raised}} as the {{youngest}} of three siblings. Johnson began fighting {{at the age of}} 10, after his father's fatal heart attack. The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing. Now that I think of it, of course, it was the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> especially putting all that burden on my mom having to deal with it." [...] Athletic, Johnson was a three-sport varsity athlete at Marquette High School in Chesterfield, Missouri. Johnson later received a full scholarship to play football at Central Methodist University, but transferred after one year to Meramec Community College where {{he was one of the}} top NJCAA wrestlers in the country.|$|E

500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They {{had the good sense to}} give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{progressive}} {{news magazine}} The Nation, the rider [...] "curtailed already weak oversight over {{the handful of}} agro-giants that control the GMO market by allowing crops that a judge ruled were not properly approved {{to continue to be}} planted." [...] According to Blunt, who did not add the rider to the bill but who supported it, [...] "What it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it". He later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt claimed all the amendment did [...] "was repeat [...] authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri Approp committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn't require the secretary to do anything that the secretary thought was the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Which {{is one of the reasons}} I thought it was fine..." ...|$|E

One should never personally accept such a lie. Not because I want to annoy others, but because I recognize therein a mockery of the Eternal Providence. I am glad if I have no internal connection with them." ...|$|R
25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> John agrees <b>to</b> falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|R
50|$|He says it {{took five}} years to write the script.I work on them really slowly. I {{do a lot of}} stand-up, so time's at a minimum, and then, after two years I looked at it and thought it was the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> - so I started again, and got it done within {{a year and a half}} after that. I then noticed I had two stories mixed into one, so I had to pick one story over the other - that's {{probably}} why it took five years, I had to realise that... I wanted the second film to have a broader appeal, then I could get more money to make it - so it would be a better looking picture. It's not a film about films - there's not a lot of film jokes in it. I'm really hoping people discover it.|$|R
60|$|I {{hear from}} England {{that you have}} {{dedicated}} a book to me with too kind and most touching words. To thank you for such a proof of sympathy, to thank you from my heart, cannot surely be a <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it seems so natural and comes from so irresistible an impulse.|$|E
60|$|So Peter hunted and hunted {{all through}} the Green Forest for Sammy Jay, and asked {{everybody}} he met if they had seen Sammy. But no one had, though every one took pains to tell Peter that they had heard Sammy in the night. At last Peter found Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. He was muttering and grumbling to himself, and he didn't see Peter. Peter stopped to listen, which was, of course, a very <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and what he heard gave Peter an idea.|$|E
60|$|You see, Danny {{knew that}} if Grandfather Frog was going to jump like that every time he was frightened, he wouldn't get very far in the Great World. It might be {{the right thing to}} do in the Smiling Pool, where the {{friendly}} water would hide him from his enemies, but it was just the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest. Danny had learned, when a very tiny fellow, that there the only safe thing to do when danger was near was to sit perfectly still and hardly breathe.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Golden Rule" [...] {{was given}} by Jesus of Nazareth, who used it to {{summarize}} the Torah: [...] "Do to others what you want them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> you. This {{is the meaning of}} the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets" [...] (Matthew 7:12 NCV, see also Luke 6:31). The common English phrasing is [...] "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583).The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the Hebrew Pentateuch as well as the Prophets and Writings. [...] ("Forget about the <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> people <b>do</b> <b>to</b> you, and <b>do</b> not try <b>to</b> get even. Love your neighbor as you love yourself."; see also Great Commandment) and [...] ("But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.").|$|R
5000|$|In a later episode, The French Connection, it is {{revealed}} that Holly got married {{the previous summer}} (i.e. shortly after she presumably graduated from high school). Hoping {{to find out what}} married life is like, Summer meets up with her. Holly introduces Summer to a couple of other recently married young Newport girls who collectively refer to themselves as the [...] "Newpsie-weds" [...] and live an incredibly shallow lifestyle of going to the gym, going to lunch and shopping. The [...] "Newpsie-weds" [...] try to help Summer plan her wedding to Seth and suggest that Pancakes (Summer's pet rabbit) should be the ring-bearer. As they've decided that the wedding should be pink-themed, Holly is about to dye Pancakes pink as a test to see how she will look. Summer realises that marrying Seth is the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> that she doesn't want to live like them, and she saves Pancakes from Holly's big pot of pink dye.|$|R
60|$|In after life, {{that child}} may settle {{far away from}} his father's home. He may go up into the temptations and bustle of some great city. He may cross to far lands beyond the sea. But need he love his parents less? need the bond between them be broken, though he may never set eyes on them again? God forbid. He may be settled far away, with children, business, {{interests}} of his own; and yet he may be doing all the while his father's will. The lessons of God which he learnt at his mother's knee may be still a lamp {{to his feet and}} a light to his path. Amid all the bustle and labour of business, his father's face may still be before his eyes, his father's voice still sound in his ears, bidding him be a worthy son to him still; bidding him not to leave that way wherein he should go, in which his parents trained him long, long since. He may feel that his parents are near him in the spirit, though absent in the flesh. Yes, though they may have passed altogether out of this world, they may be to him present and near at hand; and he may be kept from doing many a <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> and encouraged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> many a right one, by the ennobling thought, My father would have had it so, my mother would have had it so, had they been here on earth. And though in this world he may never see them again, he may look forward steadily and longingly to the day when, this life's battle over, he shall meet again in heaven those who gave him life on earth.|$|R
60|$|The scene {{took place}} in the {{conservatory}} of Mr. Merton's house, in Park Lane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual. Sybil had never seemed more happy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted to play the coward's part, to write to Lady Clementina for the pill, and to let the marriage go on as if there was no such person as Mr. Podgers in the world. His better nature, however, soon asserted itself, and even when Sybil flung herself weeping into his arms, he did not falter. The beauty that stirred his senses had touched his conscience also. He felt that to wreck so fair a life {{for the sake of a}} few months' pleasure would be a <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was a madness, but {{she refused}} to {{consider}} the madness. She was no longer herself but a woman, with a woman's clinging need; and though she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. She was no longer tired. Martin did not speak. Had he, the spell would have been broken. But his reticence of love prolonged it. He was dazed and dizzy. He could not understand what was happening. It was too wonderful {{to be anything but}} a delirium. He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms. His intuition told him it was the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation. But he luffed the boat less delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore. The shore would compel him to go about, and the contact would be broken. He sailed with skill, stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against him on his shoulder.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} moral relativism, {{most people would}} {{agree that it is}} {{ethically}} wrong to use wealth to control a situation and to ‘force’ people into renegotiating clauses in contracts if they are unable to afford the legal bill accompanying a dispute. However, as moral relativism is subject to a one’s own beliefs on what is right and wrong, some may not view using wealth as a means to control as being the <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In situations such as these, the ‘little man’ usually loses out and will ultimately succumb {{to the power of the}} other party or parties.|$|E
