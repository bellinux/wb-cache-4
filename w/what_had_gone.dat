5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong with his expedition.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E

25|$|Compared with <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> {{before and}} what {{followed}} {{it was a}} small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to be after the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever be persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E

I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted them to know that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E

The senators did not escape infamy either. By spring 1992, a deck of playing cards was being marketed, called [...] "The Savings and Loan Scandal", that featured on their face Charles Keating holding up his hand, with images of the five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers. Polls showed that most Americans believed {{the actions of the}} Keating Five were typical of Congress as a whole. Political historian Lewis Gould would later echo this sentiment, as well as Cranston attorney Dershowitz's argument, writing that, [...] "the real problem for the 'Keating Three' who were most involved was that they had been caught." ...|$|E

500|$|An early {{draft of}} the episode {{originally}} featured an Opera house explosion, which was changed because the writers felt using a dam would be more exciting.

The original script was run by the Frasier producers {{to make sure they}} were okay with it, and they only had one problem. There was a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character and refers to her as [...] "Maris", who in Frasier is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier said the scene should go. The writers spent a long time trying to figure out a civilization that considered chief hydrological engineer a true calling and chose the Cappadocians, who were famous for underground cities although not specifically dams.|$|E
500|$|After the verdict, the District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced {{a furious}} gay {{community}} to explain <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong. The prosecutor admitted to {{feeling sorry for}} White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who had recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, {{he did not want}} to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court. Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind, lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified on the last day of the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury whom he claimed had been [...] "taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [...] trial".|$|E

Mark Jones, writing for theguardian.com, called the episode [...] "suitably spooky" [...] and a [...] "fitting end to a second series that has excelled at times", and Chris Bennion, writing for The Independent, similarly described it as a [...] "brilliant series finale". A contrary opinion was offered in a review in the Liverpool Echo; the author called [...] "Séance Time" [...] a [...] "decent enough watch", but felt that it was [...] "a relatively disappointing episode" [...] which was [...] "unable to match <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> before". Baylis and Bennion stressed that the episode was very scary, with Bennion comparing it to [...] "The Harrowing"; he was complimentary of both, particularly their respective final scenes.

500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Romantics emerged {{at the end}} of the 18th century, {{they were}} not {{assuming}} a radically new invention of the subjective self themselves, but merely formalizing <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> before. [...] Similarly, the later 18th century saw a ballad revival, with Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. The relics were not always very ancient, as many of the ballads dated from only the 17th century (e.g. the Bagford Ballads or The Dragon of Wantley in the Percy Folio), and so what began as an antiquarian movement soon became a folk movement. [...] When this folk-inspired impulse combined with the solitary and individualistic impulse of the Churchyard Poets, Romanticism was nearly inevitable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a number}} of his comics, where he was taking over from earlier writers, {{including}} Marvelman, Swamp Thing, and Supreme, he used the [...] "familiar tactic of wiping out <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> before, giving the hero amnesia and revealing that everything we'd learned to that point was a lie." [...] In this manner he was largely able to start afresh with the character and their series and was not constrained by earlier canon. While commenting on the artistic restrictiveness of serialised comic books, artist Joe Rubinstein gave the example that a comics creator would be limited in what he could do with Spider-Man, and added, [...] "unless you're Alan Moore, who would probably kill him and bring him back as a real spider or something".|$|E
