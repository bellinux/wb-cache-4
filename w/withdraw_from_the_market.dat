The price paid by pharmacists and doctors is determined mainly by the number of license holders, the sales value of the original brand, and the ease of manufacture.

50|$|Bounces {{happen when}} the average selling price falls below a license holder's {{manufacturing}} cost, making the product unprofitable. License holders and manufacturers then <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> {{reducing the amount of}} competition and allowing the price to rise. They may later re-enter the market when higher prices make the product profitable once more. This usually forces the average price down again to levels lower than that seen {{before the start of the}} bounce.|$|E

50|$|As Sylvania had hoped, {{commercial}} {{interest in}} a small, low-cost, robust computer system seemed widespread. MOBIDIC was adapted into the Sylvania 9400 that was marketed towards factory automation systems.

However, as the costs of trying {{to compete in the}} commercial computer market became clear, Sylvania decided to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and General Telephone canceled their order.

50|$|Thus {{the process}} is {{continually}} evolving and correcting for anomalies {{that occur in the}} process. Eventually the process can evolve into periodic monitoring once sufficient data demonstrates that {{the process is}} in a state of control. Any anomaly that occurs once a process {{is in a state of}} control may result in the process being invalidated and not in control and could potentially result in product <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> to ensure patient safety. A formal product withdraw is only done when the quality, safety or efficacy of a product is questionable. A single anomaly would not necessarily require a product withdraw if there is sufficient stability data that demonstrates that excursions will not affect product quality.|$|E
5000|$|When {{information}} asymmetry is pertinent, a situation {{known as a}} “Market for Lemons” may occur. [...] This theory states that when a seller is more informed than a buyer, the buyer should assume {{that the quality of}} the product is average at best {{due to the lack of}} information. Therefore, sellers of high quality products will not be able to get the value that they want from buyers and have no choice but to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> unless they are willing to receive an unfair price. This leaves only lower quality items left for sale. The result is that trading occurs only at low levels of quality, leaving out both those who want to buy and sell high quality products.|$|E

50|$|After the February 2014 Ukrainian {{revolution}} {{and due to}} the War in Donbass, Ukraine's economy shrank 6.8% in 2014 and mergers and acquisitions of banks came to a standstill.

In early 2016, 117 banks were operating in Ukraine with assets amounting to 1.254 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia. By August 2016, eight more financial institutions had been declared insolvent. Since July 2015, foreign firms have started to buy Ukrainian banks again. On 17 December 2016, the National Bank of Ukraine withdrew the banking license of Finance and Credit and liquidated the bank.

5000|$|The first {{ice cream}} {{factories}} in Norway {{were established in}} the 1920s, and {{towards the end of}} the decade the Norwegian Dairies established their own brand, Diplom Is in Oslo, with its first advertisement appearing in 1930. By 1931 the production went on continually through the year, and Oslo got its own ice cream truck. Production was low during World War II, and after the war there were numerous independent ice cream manufacturers. Many of these were owned by the regional dairy cooperatives. In 1951 these were all branded as Diplom-Is and the brand became national. Though having a common brand, it was not until 1991 that all the production of ice cream by the dairies was collected in one company, Norsk Iskrem BA (lit. Norwegian Ice Cream). The following four years saw the [...] "ice cream war" [...] between Diplom-Is and the Swedish GB Is, but by 1995 GB had to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> At the same time Diplom-Is started to franchise produce the Swiss brand Mövenpick.

The RD-175 was based on the Maxxum/Dynax 505si 35 mm film SLR and used three different ½-inch CCD image sensors—two for green and one for red and blue—supplied with images by a light splitting mechanism using prisms mounted behind the lens. The RD 3000 used Minolta V-mount APS format lenses and again used multiple CCDs—this time two 1.5 MP ½-inch sensors stitched to give a 2.7 MP output image.It was not until late 2004 (after the merger with Konica) that they launched the Dynax/Maxxum/α 7D, a digital SLR based on the very successful Dynax/Maxxum 7 35 mm SLR body. The unique feature of this camera is that it features an in-body Anti-Shake system to compensate for camera shake. However, by 2004 Canon and Nikon had a whole range of digital SLR cameras and many serious photographers had already switched, thus leading Konica Minolta to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and transfer assets to Sony. The only two Konica Minolta digital SLRs to reach production before the company's withdrawal were the Dynax/Maxxum 7D and the Dynax/Maxxum 5D (which is an entry-level model that shared the 7D's sensor and Anti-Shake technology).|$|E

With private information about one’s own solvency, the best illiquid banks will not borrow but rather will liquidate some premature assets.
