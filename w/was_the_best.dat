40|$|Abstract—Optimum {{band and}} band {{combination}} for retrieving total nitrogen, water and fiber content in tealeaves with remote sensing data is investigated based on regressive analysis. Based on actual measured data of total nitrogen, fiber and water content in tealeaves {{as well as}} remotely sensed visible to near infrared reflectance data with 5 nm of wavelength steps and ASTER/VNIR onboard Terra satellite, regressive analysis <b>is</b> conducted. As <b>the</b> results, it <b>is</b> found that 1045 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for retrieving total nitrogen content while 945 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for fiber content retrieval.
