CNN-IBN reported that although Kahaani was ready before The Dirty Picture, distributors deferred its release, fearing that Vidya's role of a sexy siren (in The Dirty Picture) after that of a pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> not be received well. STAR TV bought the exclusive right to broadcast the film for a price of , which was the highest-ever price paid for a female-centric film in India. The Indian television premiere of the film was on Star India's channel Movies OK on 3 June 2012. The DVD of the film {{was released}} on 17 May 2012 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained additional content, such as behind-the-scene footage, video of celebration parties after its theatrical release, and music videos of the songs of the film. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time.|$|E

Intra-operatively, the patient must be rotated {{during the course of the}} procedure. There exists a possibility that the contour of the tissue donor-site could cause a deformity high upon the buttocks area; and the <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> have asymmetrical buttocks in the case of a unilateral breast reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{violence}} {{committed by}} men is {{to a large}} extent rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement. These belief systems grant women extremely few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances. Some men thus simply exclude the possibility that their sexual advances towards a <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> be rejected or that a woman has the right to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. In some cultures women, as well as men, regard marriage as entailing the obligation on women to be sexually available virtually without limit, though sex may be culturally proscribed at certain times, such as after childbirth or during menstruation.|$|E

25|$|Vaginal births {{are more}} common, {{but there are}} {{sometimes}} complications and a <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> undergo a caesarean section (commonly known as a C-section) instead of a vaginal delivery. The vaginal mucosa has an abnormal accumulation of fluid (edematous) and is thin, with few rugae, a little after birth. The mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately three weeks once the ovaries regain usual function and estrogen flow is restored. The vaginal opening gapes and is relaxed, until it returns to its approximate pre-pregnant state by {{six to eight weeks}} in the period beginning immediately after the birth (the postpartum period); however, it will maintain a larger shape than it previously had.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 1972, in Langenhagen, Fritz Rodewald, {{a teacher}} who had been {{providing}} accommodation to deserters from the U.S. Armed Forces, was approached by a stranger asking for an overnighting house the next day for herself and a friend. He agreed but later became suspicious that the <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> be involved with the RAF and eventually decided to call the police. The next day the pair arrived at Rodewald's dwelling while the police watched. The man was followed to a nearby telephone box and {{was found to be}} Gerhard Müller who was armed. After arresting Müller, the police then proceeded to arrest the woman – Ulrike Meinhof.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E

500|$|Donald McCormick wrote The Red Barn Mystery (1967) {{which brought}} out a {{connection}} between Corder and forger and poisoner Thomas Griffiths Wainewright when Corder was in London. According to McCormick, Caroline Palmer, an actress who was appearing frequently in the melodrama based on the case and researching the murder, [...] concluded that Corder may have not killed Maria, but that a local gypsy <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> have been the killer. [...] However, McCormick's research has been brought into question on other police- and crime-related stories, and this information has not been generally accepted.|$|E
500|$|Semonides 7 is {{generally}} considered to have been written for performance in a symposium: Robin Osborne, for example, suggests that each description {{of a different kind}} of <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> be sung to a different guest. [...] However, the treatment of women – as wives, rather than erotic or mythological figures – is significantly different from other sympotic poetry. [...] Leslie Schear argues that the poem, with its focus on wives, is related to marriage; she suggests that it was intended as a poem to be performed at a wedding feast, initiating the new groom into the ranks of married men.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

500|$|Plumlee often {{responded to}} cases {{involving}} child abuse or abandonment. Records {{show that she}} also participated in undercover investigations, including an anti-homosexual campaign organized by Mayor of Portland Dorothy McCullough Lee. In 1949, the Women's Protective Division sent Plumlee and Edna Trout to Music Hall, which was known at the time for catering to gay men and lesbians, with the intention to [...] "apprehend lesbians who might approach them and solicit attentions". Plumlee also helped educate women on how to avoid victimization. In a 1955 article by The Oregonian called [...] "Pickpockets Beware", she was photographed illustrating how a <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> be susceptible to pickpocketing by opening her billfold in public. In 1957, the paper published a photograph of Plumlee and five other women at a shooting range, with the caption: [...] "Feminine pistol team makes good showing in contest with all-male team from North precinct as interdivisional tournament gets under way". In 1959, two brothers were charged with disorderly conduct and destroying city property after tearing the speaker system from a police car occupied by Plumlee and another female officer. Plumlee also participated in civic events such as luncheons. At a 1964 Portland Yacht Club luncheon called [...] "Women with the Badge", she told female attendees how they should protect themselves and their children. In 1967, she presented slides depicting dangers to women on urban streets to the Women's Council of the Portland Board of Realtors at the Hoyt Hotel.|$|E
500|$|The Libellus {{consists}} {{of a series of}} responses (responsiones) by Gregory to [...] "certain jurisprudential, administrative, jurisdictional, liturgical and ritual questions Augustine was confronted with as leader of the fledgling English church". The numbering and order of these responses differ across the various versions of the Libellus (see below). But in the most widely known version (that reproduced in Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica) there are nine responses, each of which begins by re-stating or paraphrasing Augustine's original questions. Gregory's first response addresses questions about the relationship of a bishop to his clergy and vice versa, how gifts from the laity to the church should be divided amongst the clergy, and what the tasks of a bishop were. The second response addresses why the various northern European churches of which Augustine was aware had differing customs [...] and liturgies, and what Augustine should do when he encounters such differences. The third response was in answer to questions about the proper punishment of church robbers. The fourth and fifth response deal with who might marry whom, including whether it was allowed for two brothers to marry two sisters, or for a man to marry his step-sister or step-mother. The sixth response addresses {{whether or not it was}} acceptable for a bishop to be consecrated without other bishops present, if the distances involved prevented other bishops from attending the ceremony. The seventh response deals with relations between the church in England and the church in Gaul. The eighth response concerns what a pregnant, newly delivered, or menstruating <b>woman</b> <b>might</b> do or not do, including whether or not she is allowed to enjoy sex with her husband and how long after child-birth she has to wait to re-enter a church. The last response answers questions about whether or not men might have communion after experiencing a sexual dream, and whether or not priests might celebrate mass after experiencing such dreams. An additional chapter, not included by Bede in his Historia is known as the [...] "Obsecratio": it contains a response by Gregory to Augustine's request for relics of the local British martyr Sixtus. Gregory responds that he is sending relics of Pope Sixtus II to replace the local saint's remains, as Gregory has doubts about the actual saintly status of the British martyr. Although the authenticity of the [...] "Obsecratio" [...] has occasionally been questioned, most modern historians accept that it is genuine.|$|E
