25|$|Medieval cranes were {{occasionally}} {{powered by}} cranks, although more often by <b>windlasses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Materials : Early <b>windlasses</b> were {{individually}} hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their <b>windlasses</b> 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. <b>Windlasses</b> are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|E
25|$|Socket: Traditionally, <b>windlasses</b> had {{a single}} socket, {{designed}} for a particular canal. When undertaking a journey through several canals with different lock-gear spindle sizes {{it was necessary to}} carry several different <b>windlasses.</b> A modern windlass usually has two sockets for use on different canals: the smaller is for the British Waterways standard spindle, fitted in the early 1990s almost everywhere, the larger for the gear on the Grand Union Canal north of Napton Junction, which they were unable/unwilling to convert.|$|E

50|$|After {{leaving the}} shipyard, <b>Windlass</b> {{conducted}} diving operations off Cape Charles, Virginia before she proceeded to Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, {{to assist in}} rigging YC-1060 for technical tests. On 14 February 1952, <b>Windlass,</b> towing YC-1010, got underway for Norfolk. Two days later, while the salvage ship and her charge were en route to their destination, an explosion occurred in <b>Windlass</b> port engine crankcase, injuring one man and starting a fire. After the crew extinguished the blaze with no further damage, <b>Windlass</b> proceeded {{the remainder of the}} way to Norfolk on one engine. After arrival, both of <b>Windlass</b> engines were inspected carefully and again overhauled.|$|R
50|$|In general, a slow <b>windlass</b> {{shall be}} {{selected}} for ship launching. The veering {{speed of the}} <b>windlass</b> shall be 9 m/min to 13 m/min.|$|R
25|$|On the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the lockkeepers were {{required}} to remove the <b>windlasses</b> from all lock paddles at night, to prevent unauthorized use.|$|E
25|$|Crossbow Chamber; 98 {{crossbows}} called 'rods'; 12 crossbows called 'lathes'; 120 <b>windlasses</b> for them; 14 benders {{for small}} crossbows; archery accessories, sal ammoniac, asafoetida, quick silver, green copperas, rosalgere, camphor, etc.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and <b>windlasses</b> to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Windlass</b> {{have also}} been used in gold mining. A <b>windlass</b> would be {{constructed}} above a shaft which allowed heavy buckets to be hauled up to the surface. This process would be used until the shaft got below 40 metres deep when the <b>windlass</b> would {{be replaced by a}} 'whip' or a 'whim'.|$|R
5000|$|After {{conducting}} a channel survey at Charleston, in April, <b>Windlass</b> {{returned to the}} Hampton Roads area, where she was present when the seaplane tender [...] caught fire on 14 May 1951. <b>Windlass</b> rendered fire fighting assistance, pumped necessary compartments dry, and maintained flooding boundaries while rigging temporary gasoline lines and removing the volatile aviation gas from the seaplane tenders storage tanks. <b>Windlass</b> divers subsequently inspected that ship for underwater damage, and <b>Windlass</b> herself received a commendation for her part in averting a near disaster.|$|R
25|$|Grampus {{needed a}} <b>windlass</b> {{in order to}} work her gear, and the Fish Commission opted for a steam <b>windlass.</b> United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Zera Luther Tanner, an {{influential}} inventor and oceanographer of the era, commanding officer of the Fish Commissions fisheries research ship USFC Albatross, and previously the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, received the task of determining what type of steam apparatus Grampus should carry. He chose a steam <b>windlass</b> with engines of 35-horsepower (26.1-kW). Operating the <b>windlass</b> required the installation of a boiler, steam pump, iron water tanks, and associated piping.|$|R
25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, often seen {{in the works of}} those such as the German {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser. Devices depicted in Kyeser's Bellifortis include cranked <b>windlasses</b> (instead of spoke-wheels) for spanning siege crossbows, cranked chain of buckets for water-lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells. Kyeser also equipped the Archimedes' screws for water-raising with a crank handle, an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading. The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The Monitor was a high-winged {{aircraft}} with an all-metal fuselage {{and wooden}} wings. It was originally stipulated that the aircraft would incorporate the Bristol Beaufighter wing and landing gear {{to speed up}} design and production, but owing to increased demand for the Beaufighter only the landing gear was used, and a new all-wood one-piece wing was designed. The aircraft was powered by two Wright Cyclone R-2600-31 radial engines driving Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers. It was fitted with a novel hydraulic winch as the normal <b>windlasses</b> {{could not be used}} at speeds of much more than , while the Monitor was required to tow targets at double this speed.|$|E
25|$|Received {{from the}} charge of Sir Anthony Denny; 6 forest bills, 2 with black staves, 4 white; 2 partisans. (staff-weapon for {{ceremonial}} use), party gilt with the King's arms graven on them, garnished with green passementerie, fringed with green and white silk; 3 partisans party gilt garnished with blue velvet and fringed with blue silk; 37 partisans party gilt garnished with green velvet and fringed with green and white silk; more partisans, pikes and targets; 7 crossbows of sundry making with 4 pairs of <b>windlasses</b> being broken; a rack to bend a crossbow; a crossbow for stone shot; a quiver for prick arrows for crossbows.|$|E
50|$|Finally, however, a {{solution}} was worked out. With <b>Windlass</b> and Salvager in keystone positions, the various tugs, salvage ships, and submarine rescue vessels were utilized {{so as to}} maximize their pulling power. As {{a result of that}} combined effort, Missouri finally slid free but nearly ran down several of the salvage ships, including <b>Windlass.</b> For her part in that operation, <b>Windlass</b> received a commendation.|$|R
50|$|The Aeronaut's <b>Windlass</b> is {{the first}} novel of The Cinder Spires series written by Jim Butcher. It is a steampunk fantasy series. The Aeronaut's <b>Windlass</b> mixes steampunk technologies, magical wars and {{intelligent}} cats.|$|R
50|$|A trawl <b>windlass</b> is {{a similar}} machine that restrains or manipulates the trawl on a {{commercial}} fishing vessel. The trawl {{is a sort of}} big fishing net that is wound on the <b>windlass.</b> The fishermen either let-out the trawl or heaves-up the trawl during fishing operations. A brake is provided for control and a <b>windlass</b> is usually powered by an electric or hydraulic motor operating via a gear train.|$|R
25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and <b>windlasses</b> to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and <b>windlasses</b> or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{undermining}} a structure, some besiegers used borers {{to drill}} holes in the outer walls {{in an effort to}} destroy them; such methods were more effective than rams on brick walls (which tended to absorb the shocks from the ram). [...] Borers differed in size and mechanism, but a typical machine was made from a log of wood, tipped with iron and supported and driven by <b>windlasses</b> or ropes. [...] Once a series of holes had been bored along the length of a wall, the holes were typically filled with rods of dry wood, saturated with sulfur or pitch and then ignited. [...] Bellows could be used to encourage a blaze.|$|E
50|$|In September, <b>Windlass</b> {{returned}} to Norfolk where she resumed her local operations. Two months later, on 8 November 1954, <b>Windlass</b> headed {{to a point}} off Cape Henry where she commenced salvage operations trying to raise two sunken planes. One broke up while being raised {{and could not be}} recovered. On 13 November, <b>Windlass</b> recovered the body of one aviator that had been lost in one of the downed planes.|$|R
50|$|A <b>windlass</b> {{shall be}} used to control the {{movement}} of the ship. Tow system that comprises <b>windlass,</b> steel wire rope and pulley set shall be securely fastened to the ground anchor in front of the berth.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Windlass</b> and Salvager {{assisted}} in a four-point moor over [...] on 10 August 1948 and conducted salvage tests off Piney Point, Maryland {{on the former}} German U-boat until 25 August. Hurricane Carol interrupted operations as she swept through the area on 30 and 31 August, but both salvage vessels rode out the storm without damage, despite the force 5 winds. <b>Windlass</b> took the almost-submerged U-1105 undertow, supporting her partially with pontoons, and moored the ship on 28 September. <b>Windlass</b> and Salvager then performed various moors and salvage operations on the submarine's hulk off Piney Point until 18 November before returning to Bayonne. There, <b>Windlass</b> remained into 1949.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the trireme {{differed}} from modern practice. The {{construction of a}} trireme was expensive and required around 6000 man-days of labor to complete. The ancient Mediterranean practice was to build the outer hull first, and the ribs afterwards. To secure and strengthen the hull, cables (hypozōmata) were employed, fitted in the keel and stretched by means of <b>windlasses.</b> Hence the triremes were often called [...] "girded" [...] when in commission.|$|E
2500|$|A boatswain's skills {{may include}} cargo rigging, winch operations, deck maintenance, working aloft, and other duties {{required}} during deck operations. The boatswain is {{well versed in}} the care and handling of lines, and has knowledge of knots, hitches, bends, whipping, and splices as needed to perform tasks such as mooring a vessel. The boatswain typically operates the ship's <b>windlasses</b> when letting go and heaving up anchors. [...] Moreover, a boatswain may {{be called upon to}} lead firefighting efforts or other emergency procedures encountered on board. [...] Effective boatswains are able to integrate their seafarer skills into supervising and communicating with members of deck crew with often diverse backgrounds.|$|E
60|$|Suiting {{the action}} to the word, Jack gave forth, {{at the top}} of his voice, one or two of those peculiarly {{nautical}} howls wherewith seamen are wont to constrain <b>windlasses</b> and capstans to creak, and anchors to let go their hold.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Windlass</b> {{received}} a summons {{to assist in}} refloating the grounded destroyer [...] off Fort Story. Rough weather hampered the operations which were begun on 5 January 1956, and [...] also ran aground during the attempt to pull Basilone free. Wires snapped on board , and <b>Windlass</b> dragged dangerously near the destroyer and the beach but managed to cut loose and steer clear. With ice on her decks and rigging, <b>Windlass</b> returned to Norfolk the next day.|$|R
5000|$|Again {{in company}} with Salvager, <b>Windlass</b> moved to Newport, Rhode Island, in early February 1949, {{for a period}} of upkeep {{alongside}} [...] Later that month, <b>Windlass</b> shifted to Newport and trained there before she returned to Bayonne on 23 March.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Windlass</b> {{can be used}} {{to raise}} water from a well. The oldest {{description}} of a well <b>windlass,</b> a rotating wooden rod installed across the mouth of a well, is found in Isidore of Seville's ( [...] 560-636) Origenes (XX, 15, 1-3).|$|R
60|$|The <b>windlasses</b> {{groaned and}} twisted, and then, of a sudden, one broke from its {{fastenings}} {{and hit the}} side of the ship, letting the steel cable slip down into the water. This allowed the bow to rise and the stern to go down.|$|E
60|$|The ferry {{bumped into}} its slip, the <b>windlasses</b> sang loudly {{as they took}} up the chains, the gates folded back, and Honora was forced with the crowd along the bridge-like passage to the right. Suddenly she saw Cousin Eleanor and the girls {{awaiting}} her.|$|E
60|$|Captain Williamson was {{now trying}} to raise the vessel by means of steel cables slipped under the bow and stern. The cable ends on the ice pack side were {{fastened}} down by crowbars set in deep holes, and the other ends were hauled as near taut as possible by means of temporary <b>windlasses.</b>|$|E
50|$|After salvage {{operations}} on Kellar were completed on 11 November, <b>Windlass</b> began preparations for decommissioning. On 23 November 1965, <b>Windlass</b> was decommissioned at New Orleans and {{converted to a}} non-self-propelled craft over the ensuing months. Re-classified as a medium salvage craft on 16 October 1967 and given the hull number YMLC-4, <b>Windlass</b> was placed in service with Advanced Bases, Pacific area, but was used minimally in ensuing years. Since replacement craft attained superior lift capability, the need for <b>Windlass</b> services diminished; she was accordingly struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1972 and sold on 6 March 1973 to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corporation, New York City, where she was cut up for scrap.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Windlass</b> then {{sailed to}} Cape Fear, North Carolina, later that summer and {{surveyed}} {{the area around the}} sunken YSD-68. A hurricane caused a brief change in plans, however, as the salvage ship shifted briefly to Charleston to avoid it. On 29 September, <b>Windlass</b> began dragging the bottom with a [...] "hawk" [...] anchor and, on 6 October, located the self-propelled seaplane wrecking derrick on the bottom, upside down. Despite a period of [...] "unusually adverse weather" [...] and what <b>Windlass</b> command history termed [...] "the usual salvage job setbacks," [...] <b>Windlass</b> raised YSD-68 early in November. The bad weather during that period had meant frequent interruptions to put into the nearest port, Southport, North Carolina.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The human foot, {{which is}} the part of the body that interacts with the {{environment}} during locomotion, consists of rich biomechanical design. One of the unique designs of human feet is the <b>windlass</b> mechanism. In a previous simulation study, we found that the <b>windlass</b> mechanism seems to improve the energy efficiency of walking. To better understand the origin of this efficiency, we here conduct both simulation and experimental studies exploring the influence of foot compliance, {{which is one of the}} functionalities that the <b>windlass</b> mechanism embeds, on the energetics of walking. The studies show that walking with compliant feet incurs more energetic costs than walking with stiff feet. The preliminary results suggest that the energy saved by introducing the <b>windlass</b> mechanism does not originate from the compliance it embeds. We speculate that the energy savings of the <b>windlass</b> mechanism are related more to its contribution to reducing the effective foot length in swing than to providing compliance in stance.
