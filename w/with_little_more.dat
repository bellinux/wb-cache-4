5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than their lives intact.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> {{than a few}} {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} and popular pressure for reform {{had grown so}} great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority {{in the general election}} of 1831. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.|$|E

A few hours later, they spotted land-based white terns (Gygis alba) followed by a diminution of the trade-wind swell. That night, they spotted Mataiva. After a brief stopover, <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than another day's sailing they made landfall at Tahiti where they were welcomed by 17,000 people, half the population of Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

25|$|Several {{dependencies}} {{and similar}} territories with broad autonomy {{are also found}} within or {{in close proximity to}} Europe. This includes Ã…land (a region of Finland), two constituent countries of the Kingdom Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three Crown dependencies, and two British Overseas Territories. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three countries of the United Kingdom with devolved powers and the two Autonomous Regions of Portugal, which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a unique tax status, such as Heligoland and the Canary Islands, are also not included for this reason.|$|E

25|$|In August 1927, {{when the}} {{conflict}} {{was at its}} height, the Inyo County bank collapsed, which massively undermined valley resistance. An audit revealed that there were shortages in both cash in the vault and amounts shown on the books. The Watterson brothers were indicted for embezzlement, then tried and convicted on thirty-six counts. Since all local business had been transacted through their bank, the closure left merchants and customers <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than {{the small amount of}} money they had on hand. The brothers claimed that the fraud was done {{for the good of the}} Owens Valley against Los Angeles, and this excuse was generally believed to be true in Inyo County. The collapse of the bank wiped out the lifetime savings of many people, including payments gained from the sale of homes and ranches to Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|After his {{banishment}} from Cambridge Empson supported {{himself for}} a brief period as a freelance critic and journalist, living in Bloomsbury until 1930, when he signed a three-year contract to teach in Japan after his tutor Richards had failed to find him a post teaching in China. He returned to England in the mid-1930s only to depart again after receiving a three-year contract to teach at Peking University. Upon his arrival he discovered that, because of the Japanese invasion of China, he no longer had a post. He joined the exodus of the university's staff, <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a typewriter and a suitcase, and ended up in Kunming, with Lianda (Southwest Associated University), the school created there by students and professors who were refugees from the war in the North. He arrived back in England in January 1939.|$|E
25|$|When Franklin Richards {{was kidnapped}} by Onslaught, Doom joined the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk {{was able to}} crack open Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught {{remained}} as pure psionic energy, separated Hulk and Banner, planning to spread across the planet. Thor Odinson plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, {{the majority of the}} Avengers, and the Hulk-less Banner followed in short order, with Doom being forced to join the sacrifice when Iron Man tackled the villain into the energy mass. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth, except for Doom, who remained there for a time. Doom uncovers the secret power {{at the heart of the}} planet, an avatar of his arch-foe Reed Richards' son, Franklin, the super-powered youth who conjured this globe and left a bit of himself behind to guide it from within. Doom managed to convince the little boy to relinquish control of this world <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a few errant promises of a better life.|$|E

25|$|The {{president}} of the Real Audiencia authorized that classes should start while they were awaiting the authorization to build the new school for the students; {{at the time they}} only had one classroom in the Dominican convent where, in theory, they gave the Arts, Theology and Religion classes. After several decades, discussions and petitions, king Carlos II on 31 January 1676, granted a license to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala to found a University. This would be third royal university in the Spanish Empire in America, and the second in New Spain, after the one in Mexico. After the disputatious process of organization, and five years after the royal decree, the university started officially its lectures of five of the nine classes, on 7 January 1681, <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> of sixty registered students and with its first president, Dr. JosÃ© de BaÃ±os y Soto Mayor, {{who was in charge of}} the Cathedral, Preacher of the King of Spain and Doctor from the University of Osuna. The university started under the protection of San Carlos Borromeo, with its first directive written by Francisco Saraza y Arce, who copied from those of the University of MÃ©xico which, in turn, were adapted from the Universidad de Salamanca in Spain.|$|E
25|$|For {{four centuries}} after the Norman invasion, {{the growth of}} Leeds was slow. Its site had no {{particular}} military advantages: the great strategic position of that part of Yorkshire was at Pontefract, close by. It had, at first, no commercial valuesâ€”it may have been that its first beginnings in its staple wool trade sprang from the wool growing of the Cistercians at Kirkstall Abbey, on its western borders. The township was concerned <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than agriculture, and such trade as it knew was confined to those retailings which establish themselves wherever communities spring upâ€”dealings in the necessities of life, which, reduced to a minimum, are merely food and clothing. The town itself was smallâ€”it was probably confined within a triangle formed on {{the lines of the}} present lower Briggate, Kirkgate, and the River Aire, with the parish church at one angle somewhere about, perhaps on, the site of the modern one. The streets would be narrow, unpaved and unlighted. The houses, {{in spite of the fact}} that stone is so plentiful in the district, were of wood, whitewashed, in many cases, thatched. All around the town lay the open fields and meadows, cultivated on the principle of strip-farming. And beyond these lay the forest of Elmet.|$|E
25|$|He did {{not remain}} there for much longer, however, as, in September 1942, he was {{promoted}} to become GOC II Corps as the British Army's youngest acting lieutenant general. However, the corps was actually II Corps District, a static formation, with responsibility for the defence of northern East Anglia against invasion. By this time, the threat of invasion had much receded and, by early 1943, much of Templer's command had been posted away, the 1st Division moving to North Africa and the 76th Division being reduced to a reserve division, leaving Templer <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 30 Home Guard battalions. Then, in April 1943, he took command of XI Corps, with the 54th and 61st Divisions and numerous smaller units under command. In May XI Corps absorbed II Corps and assumed responsibility for the defence of all of East Anglia. Despite this, Templer was growing impatient at training troops and wished for a field command. To this end, in July, he approached General Sir Bernard Paget, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces (and formerly one of Templer's instructors at the Staff College), and offered to give up his rank of acting lieutenant general so that he could command a division on active service. His offer was accepted and, together with Gerard Bucknall (a fellow student at the Staff College who, like Templer, had risen rapidly but was presumably sharing his mindset), Templer, reverting to major general on 30 July, flew out to Algiers, arriving there the day after.|$|E
