50|$|Because the Deutsche Bundesbahn had {{sufficient}} goods train locomotives, they could quickly phase out the DRB Class 52 engines, {{so that the}} ageing boilers on the Class 50s could be replaced by those of the Class 52s.

Thus 35 machines were given a boiler <b>with</b> <b>mixer</b> preheater and turbo feed pumps. Number 50 1503 was experimentally equipped with a Giesl ejector.

The score for the first act was released as a soundtrack album on the same day {{the first half of the}} game became publicly available. The soundtrack was released on vinyl in September 2016.|$|E

50|$|Eyebeam {{expanded}} its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops <b>with</b> <b>MIXER,</b> a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance {{artists in the}} field of live video and audio, in late 2007. The inaugural event, “Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),” was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of North Brother Island and Wards Island by media artist Benton C Bainbridge. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City’s underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including DāM-FunK, Extreme Animals, CHERYL, and D-Fuse AV. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir’s littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. The results of an experimental study {{of the process of}} convective heat transfer in the apparatus <b>with</b> <b>mixer</b> for the smooth and rough ring-shaped pipes are presented. It is established that the creation of two-dimensions! artificial roughness on the heated surface causes the essential (- 100 %) intensification of heat transfer for both the normal and crisis regimes of mixing. The similitude equation for calculating heat transfer coefficient, which generalizes well experimental data both for the smooth and the rough surfaces, is proposed. Considerations, satisfactorily explaining some special features of the process of the heat transfer of rough surfaces in the apparatus <b>with</b> <b>mixer</b> are given. ksb 201...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the scale-up of bread dough mixers. Previous research reports into dough mixer scale-up only consider the dough development aspect of mixing and neglect aeration, despite over-aeration being a known problem that occurs with scale-up. A series of experiments was performed on three scales of the Tweedy-type high-intensity mixer. A pressure step-change was introduced during mixing, and dimensionless aeration parameters for each mixer were found through measurement of the dough voidage response, using a previously reported aeration model. The degree of steady state aeration, the turnover rate and the volumetric entrainment rate were all found to increase <b>with</b> <b>mixer</b> scale, or alternatively with Reynolds number. The number density of bubbles in the dough and the mean bubble size could not be seen to vary significantly with scale, but both increased <b>with</b> <b>mixer</b> headspace pressure...|$|E
