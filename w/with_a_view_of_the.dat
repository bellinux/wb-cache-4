5|$|In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere {{hosted a}} visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. They stayed at Worsley Hall, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges. Large crowds had {{gathered}} to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge {{so much that they}} fell into the canal.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, the old visitor centre {{closed and}} work on a new visitor centre started. The new Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on Monday 11 April 2011. It {{includes}} a new entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a new Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, and a glass-walled cafe <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaping of the gardens including a new Galaxy Maze. A large orrery was installed in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car {{on the side of}} the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones {{was a member of}} the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E
5|$|It has two {{landscaped}} picnic areas. Facilities {{include a}} tea shop, with {{indoor and outdoor}} seating areas <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, {{but there is a}} boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{was intended as}} a home for Jack Malloch and his son, John Rolph Malloch. Both men were partners in a father/son architectural firm based in San Francisco, and both wanted to live on Telegraph Hill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Bay. They determined to build an apartment which would provide them with fine dwellings and also with income from the rental units it held. Irvin Goldstine (sometimes written Irving or Irvine) designed the building for them; he had recently graduated from l'École des Beaux-Arts but had not yet earned his architect's license, so he was not listed as the architect of record. Instead, the Mallochs were listed. Goldstine obtained his license in 1940, four years after he first sketched the Malloch Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern shore}} of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing {{of this little}} house – now {{the site of the}} Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of the house is a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E
5|$|The west {{facade of}} the house is the most ornate, and faces the Hudson River, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river from its terrace and west-facing windows. The curtain wall between the facade's pavilions {{contains}} a semicircular portico, and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-cochère, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a portico of Ionic columns over the entranceway.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slide and former lake. The roadbed {{was not expected}} to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
25|$|To {{commemorate the}} centennial of British Columbia, a silver dollar is issued. With a reverse {{designed}} by Stephen Trenka, a totem pole {{is the focal point}} of the design <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains in the background.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to report the effects <b>of</b> window <b>views</b> and indoor plants on human psychophysiological {{response}} in workplace environments. The effects <b>of</b> window <b>views</b> and indoor plants were recorded by measuring participant's electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), blood volume pulse (BVP), and state-anxiety. Photo Impact 5. 0 was used to simulate the environment in an office, where six conditions were examined: 1) window <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city, 2) window <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city and indoor plants, 3) window <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> nature, 4) window <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> nature and indoor plants, 5) office without <b>a</b> window <b>view,</b> and 6) office without <b>a</b> window <b>view</b> and indoor plants. Participants were less nervous or anxious when watching <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> nature and/or when indoor plants were present. When neither the window view nor the indoor plants were shown, participants suffered the highest degree of tension and anxiety...|$|R

25|$|In November 1976, {{when the}} storyline {{included}} the blossoming romance of Rick Redfern and Joanie Caucus, {{four days of}} strips were devoted to a transition from one apartment to another, ending <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two together in bed, marking the first time any nationally run comic strip portrayed premarital sex in this fashion. Again, the strip {{was removed from the}} comics pages of a number of newspapers, although some newspapers opted to simply repeat the opening frame of that day's strip.|$|E
