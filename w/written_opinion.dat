5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E

During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing Senator Orrin Hatch to fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 2008, {{following}} a two-day hearing, Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st Judicial District Court ordered {{all of the}} FLDS children {{to remain in the}} temporary custody of Child Protective Services. Judge Walther's ruling was subsequently reversed by the 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin, Texas in a ruling that Texas CPS was not justified in removing every child from the ranch. The 3rd Court of Appeals granted mandamus relief and ordered the trial court to vacate the portion of its order giving CPS temporary custody of the FLDS children. CPS petitioned the Texas Supreme Court requesting that the 3rd Court of Appeals' ruling be overturned, but the Texas Supreme Court, in a <b>written</b> <b>opinion</b> issued May 29, 2008, declined to overturn the ruling of the 3rd Court of Appeals.|$|E

As a result of the verdict being overturned, the costs of the appeal were assessed to Sega. The injunction remained in force, however, because Sega petitioned the appeals court to rehear the case.|$|E

500|$|Wood {{rested his}} case {{on behalf of}} the plaintiff; McNamara offered no {{evidence}} but again moved to dismiss, which Humphrey denied. The judge told the all-male jury that if the LIRR employees [...] "omitted to do the things which prudent and careful trainmen do for the safety of those who are boarding their trains, as well as the safety of those who are standing upon the platform waiting for other trains, and that the failure resulted in the plaintiff's injury, then the defendant would be liable." [...] The jury was out for two hours and 35 minutes, including the lunch hour, and they awarded Palsgraf $6,000 ($ today). Pursuant to statute, she also recovered costs of $142, an amount added to the verdict. A motion for a new trial was denied on May 27, 1927 by Justice Humphrey, who did not issue a <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> and a judgment was entered on the verdict on May 31, from which the LIRR appealed on June 14. Once Palsgraf had gotten her jury verdict, the Gerhardts also sued the railroad, with Wood as their counsel.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his <b>written</b> <b>opinion.</b> Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hand {{took part}} in three notable cases that posed a {{particular}} challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues: United States v. Coplon, United States v. Dennis, and United States v. Remington. Department of Justice worker Judith Coplon had been sentenced to 15 {{years in prison for}} stealing and attempting to pass on defense information. In 1950, her appeal came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand. It rested on her claim that her rights under the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by a warrantless search, and that details of illegal wiretaps had not been fully disclosed at her trial. Hand made it clear that Coplon was guilty of the charges. However, he rejected the trial judge's conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified. He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence. The trial judge's failure to disclose all the wiretap records, Hand concluded, made a reversal of Coplon's conviction necessary. In his <b>written</b> <b>opinion,</b> Hand stated that [...] "ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens." [...] Many followers of the trial sent Hand hate mail for his decision. By contrast, in the 1950 case United States v. Dennis, Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States for subversion. He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a [...] "probable danger" [...] to justify the invasion of free speech. After the case, he was attacked from the opposite political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism.|$|E
