500|$|Many {{people believe}} that Donen owed {{everything}} to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having [...] "no particular identity or evident talent... and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> from the south who {{wanted to make it}} in show business." [...] Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public, such as berating him {{for not being able to}} keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for Cover Girl. Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of It's Always Fair Weather. After Donen's recent hits Deep in My Heart and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.|$|E
