The <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Programme</b> provided about 58tons of food to 5,500families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1,300Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000people.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the United Nations <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Programme's</b> (WFP) Supply Chain Management Dashboard (SCM-D), {{a tool that}} increases operational efficiencies and effectiveness by enhancing Supply Chain (SC) visibility. Each year WFP assists an average of 80 million people across more than 80 countries. It is therefore critical for WFP to understand what processes are taking place at each stage of its global Supply Chain to allow for timely mitigation of risks, forward and contingency planning and optimization, as well as identification and propagation of best practices. The SCM-D provides this end-to-end visibility into the WFP Supply Chain, serving as a “one stop” holistic overview that condenses the SC situation for an operation. The SCM-D promotes integrated Supply Chain Management by facilitating collaboration amongst different business units and supporting better informed Executive Management decision making. An online platform applies the efficiency and effectiveness gains of the tool to all WFP operations, and makes the SCM-D accessible to staff anywhere and at any time. Simplicity {{is key to the}} design, with the information reflected on the SCM-D being detailed enough to allow for comprehensive understanding of an operation and identification of risks, challenges and opportunities; yet broad enough to provide a clear and integrated end-to-end SC picture. The tool increases operational transparency and efficiency, value for money of funds, and ultimately supports the delivery of critical food assistance to millions of vulnerable families. All of these gains bring WFP one step closer to achieving its goal of a world with Zero Hunger...|$|R

The efficacy {{of this strategy}} is unknown for the <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Programme's</b> Super Cereal Plus (SC+) and Super Cereal (SC) blends. The primary goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the increased energy intake from amylase-containing SC+ and SC compared to control porridges in Burkinabe children. Secondly, energy intake from amylase-containing porridges compared to CERELAC((R)), Vitazom, and eeZeeBAR was studied. Thirdly, caregivers' (n= 100) porridge acceptability was investigated. The design was a randomized double-blind controlled cross-over trial studying the effect of amylase addition to SC+ and SC flours on porridge energy and nutrient intake in healthy Burkinabe children aged 12 - 23 (n= 80) and 24 - 35 months (n= 40). Amylase added to porridges increased energy density from 0. 68 to 1. 16 kcal/g for SC+ and from 0. 66 to 1. 03 kcal/g for SC porridges. Among children aged 12 - 23 months, mean energy intake from all porridges with amylase (135 - 164 kcal/meal) was significantly higher compared to control SC+ porridges (84 - 98 kcal/meal; model-based average). Among children aged 24 - 35 months, mean energy intakes were also significantly higher from all porridges with amylase added (245 - 288 kcal/meal) compared to control SC porridges (175 - 183 kcal/meal). Acceptability of the porridges among caregivers was rated neutral to good, both for amylase-added and non-amylase-containing porridges. These findings suggest that, among 12 - 35 -month-old, adding amylase to fortified blended foods significantly increased energy and consequently nutrient intake per meal by 67 % for SC+ and 47 % for SC. Moreover, amylase-containing porridges were well accepted by the caregivers...|$|R
40|$|Masters of ArtDiversifying {{livelihoods}} {{has over}} the last two decades been identified as an important theme in the development work, particularly concerning the poverty reduction agenda. In the developing world, farm households, urged on by their survival instinct, diversify away from traditional subsistence agriculture to the production of high-value crops and at other times engage in off-farm and non-farm activities. This has become necessary due to the failures of agriculture to guarantee farm households sustainable livelihoods and improve their welfare. In sub-Saharan Africa, diversification is a vital instrument for reducing rural people’s risk to poverty. In recent years, however, diversification has been closely linked to food security. This is due to the fact that chronic food insecurity and its accompanying vulnerabilities continue to thwart poverty reduction efforts in the developing world. Paradoxically, whereas available statistics suggests that there is enough food to feed everyone, close to 900 million of the world’s population is still food insecure. By implication, the food security challenge hinge on ‘access’ rather than food availability. In sub-Saharan Africa and for that matter Northern Ghana, the phenomenon is quite pervasive, often affecting rural farm households. This signals one thing – a travesty to the existence of international human rights frameworks. Already, available empirical studies on the extent to which diversification amongst farm households impact on assuring household food security have revealed mixed results and are silent on the gender consequences. Using <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Programme’s</b> 2012 Comprehensive <b>Food</b> Security and Vulnerability Analysis survey conducted in northern Ghana and an ordinary least squares estimator, this study sought to examine how livelihood diversification contributes to household food security and subsequently validate its effect for male and female-headed farm households in the Bole district of the Northern region of Ghana. Results from the study revealed a significant positive relationship between livelihood diversification (the number of livelihood activities farm households engaged in) and household food security (household food consumption score). Whereas similar result was observed for male-headed households, that of female-headed households was insignificant even though positive. Following this, the study proposes a two-fold policy strategy for optimizing the impact of livelihood diversification on guaranteeing food security amongst farm households in the case study district in particular and northern Ghana in general. Firstly, support for boosting smallholder agriculture should be pursued rigorously, taking advantage of programmes such as the Savannah Plan for Accelerated Growth. Secondly, sustaining, up-scaling and re-orienting programmes such as Rural Enterprises Project and creating the policy milieu for farm households to explore local opportunities like eco-tourism should be mainstreamed, taking into account concerns of gender...|$|R
