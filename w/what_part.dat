These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> of the dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|Exactly <b>what</b> <b>part</b> each {{played in}} the authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George Woodcock noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (<b>what</b> <b>part</b> of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} <b>what</b> <b>part</b> of the tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood {{has been found in}} up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Welsh and the English persisted and spilled over in 1400 with the {{outbreak}} of the Glyndŵr Rising. It is uncertain <b>what</b> <b>part</b> the castle played in the conflict, but it seems to have survived intact. In 1416, the castle passed through Isabel le Despenser in marriage to her first husband Richard de Beauchamp, the earl of Worcester, and then to her second husband, Richard Beauchamp, the earl of Warwick. Isabel and her second husband invested heavily in the castle, conducting repairs and making it suitable for use as their main residence in the region. The castle passed to Richard Neville in 1449 and to Jasper Tudor, the earl of Pembroke, in 1486.|$|E

25|$|The {{serotonin}} neurotransmitter has {{the ability}} to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors. Depending on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> of the brain region serotonin is being acted upon, will depend on whether the output is either increasing or decreasing post-synaptic responses. The most popular and widely used drugs in the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap to be used.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June 1762, {{with the}} aid of her lover Grigory Orlov, Catherine rallied the troops of Saint Petersburg to her support and {{declared}} herself Catherine II, the sovereign ruler of Russia, later naming her son Paul as her heir. She had Peter arrested and forced him to sign an act of abdication. When he sought permission to leave the country, she refused it, intending to hold him prisoner for life. He had only a few days to live, however, as shortly after his arrest, he was strangled to death by Catherine's supporters, though no one knows <b>what</b> <b>part</b> Catherine had in Peter's death.|$|E
25|$|Mesrop, desirous {{to remedy}} {{this state of}} things, {{resolved}} to invent a national alphabet, in which undertaking Isaac and King Vramshapuh promised to assist him. It is hard to determine exactly <b>what</b> <b>part</b> Mesrop had in the fixing of the new alphabet. According to his Armenian biographers, he consulted Daniel, a bishop of Mesopotamia, and Rufinus, a monk of Samosata, on the matter. With their help and that of Isaac and the king, {{he was able to}} give a definite form to the alphabet, which he probably adapted from the Greek. Others, like Lenormant, think it derived from the Avestan. Mesrop's alphabet consisted of thirty-six letters; two more (long O and F) were added in the twelfth century.|$|E

Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly <b>what</b> <b>part</b> of his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, to attachment to a preconceived idea or to mere misinformation, his few writings on the subject do seem to display a certain level of short-sightedness regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had, by then, already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony’s potential for further development.|$|E
