500|$|Varian and {{her parents}} began using the farm name [...] "Varian Arabians" [...] in 1954. She {{credited}} her parents for helping her believe that she could do whatever she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> for trusting her own judgement, which gave her confidence in her own ability to work with horses. They worked as a team to build a horse business; Eric, an electrical contractor, built fences and managed the land, Wenonah studied pedigrees, and Sheila handled the horses. In time, their ranch expanded from 21 to 150 acres. As a young adult, Varian completed college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and taught high school physical education for three years, until 1963, when running the Varian Arabian ranch became her full-time job. The ranch was self-supporting from 1963 on, with the short-term assistance of loans from Sheila's aunt, Dorothy Varian, which were promptly repaid. Ultimately, the ranch grew to 230 acres.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld is {{considered}} the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence {{has been found in}} BioShock (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that [...] "all the things that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [...]" [...] Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had [...] "far more impact on me than Doom". Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include , Deus Ex, , , and Half-Life 2. Toby Gard stated that, when designing Tomb Raider, he [...] "was a big fan of ...

[...] Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later System Shock.|$|E

[...] However, several critics {{commented that the}} book was {{straightforward}} and presented few interesting stories. Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook."
