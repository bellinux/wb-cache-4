40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to compare {{morphological}} features and to evaluate wetting capabilities of two fiber-reinforced composites (FRCS); group A: Stick Tech®, by Stick Tech Ltd, Turku, Finland, and group B: Ribbond®, by Ribbond Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA, used in orthodontic retention, by scanning electron microscope (SEM). 6 groups were identified in relation to the fiber used, A: Everstick®, B: Ribbond®, and to the different times of exposition to a fluid wetting resin (Heliobond®, by Schaan, Liechtenstein) : A 1 -B 1 = 0 seconds, A 2 -B 2 = 5 seconds, A 3 -B 3 = 5 minutes. Wetting was followed by 40 seconds of light curing with a conventional halogen curing light Optilux 501 ® d with a light intensity of 930 mW|cm 2 and a wavelength range of 400 - 505 nm Samples were SEM analyzed both in cross section and lengthwise. SEM observation revealed a lengthwise direction of cylindrically shaped fibers immersed in a metacrylate matrix in group A 1 and straight but woven fibers in group B 1. In both control groups voids ranging between 0 μm and 20 μm were visible between the fibers and groups of fibers. Groups A 2 and B 2 showed uniform coverage with Heliobond® and microcracks were visible. In cross section views it is apparent that <b>wetting</b> <b>with</b> Heliobond for just 5 seconds was not sufficient for the adhesive to impregnate the fibers deeply. Groups A 3 and B 3 revealed a deeper penetration of Heliobond®; voids ranging between 5 μm and 15 μm could be observed only in the deepest portion of the fiber. The fiber’s preparation plays a decisive role: a longer fiber <b>wetting</b> time <b>with</b> <b>fluid</b> resin before curing, enhances the morphological features of FRC, making them more suitable for passive and active orthodontic systems, periodontology or prosthetic dentistr...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} a preliminary investigation {{on the role}} of wettability conditions on the flow of a two-phase system in porous media. Since such effects have been lumped implicitly in relative permeability-saturation and capillary pressure-saturation relationships, it is quite challenging to isolate its effects explicitly in real porous media applications. However, within the framework of pore network models, it is easy to highlight the effects of wettability conditions on the transport of two-phase systems. We employ quasi-static investigation in which the system undergo slow movement based on slight increment of the imposed pressure. Several numerical experiments of the drainage process are conducted to displace a <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>with</b> a non-wetting one. In all these experiments the network is assigned different scenarios of various wettability patterns. The aim is to show that the drainage process is very much affected by the imposed pattern of wettability. The wettability conditions are imposed by assigning the value of contact angle to each pore throat according to predefined patterns...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{the effect of a}} second phase on the distribution of fluid phase and dissolution of quartz grains. However, as most observations came from aggregates deformed under hydrostatic stress conditions and mica-bearing quartz rocks, 3 -D distribution of pores on quartz-quartz (QQB) and quartz-hematite boundaries (QHB) has been studied. Several fracture surfaces oriented according to finite strain ellipsoid were analyzed. The pore distribution characterizes the porosity and grain shape as highly anisotropic, which results from the nature and orientation of boundaries. QHB have physical/chemical properties very different from QQB, once the hematite plates have strong effect on wetting behavior of fluid, likewise micas in quartzites. They are pore-free flat surfaces, normal to compression direction, suggesting that they were once <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> a continuous <b>fluid</b> film acting as faster diffusion pathway. At QQB, the pores are faceted, isolated, close to its edges reflecting the crystallographic control and an interconnected network of fluid along grain junctions. The QQB facing the extension direction are sites of fluid concentration. As consequence, the anisotropic dissolution and grain growth were responsible for the formation of hematite plates and tabular quartz grains significantly contributing for the generation of the foliation observed in the studied rocks...|$|R
40|$|Phase change cooling schemes {{involving}} passive heat spreading devices, such as {{heat pipes}} and vapor chambers, are widely adopted for thermal management of high heat-flux technologies. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{are fabricated on}} a 200 micrometer thick sintered copper powder wick layer using microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. A physical vapor deposition process is used to coat the CNTs with a varying thickness of copper to promote surface <b>wetting</b> <b>with</b> the working <b>fluid,</b> water. Thermal performance of the bare sintered copper powder sample (without CNTs) and the copperfunctionalized CNT-coated sintered copper powder wick samples is compared using an experimental facility that simulates the capillary fluid feeding conditions of a vapor chamber. A notable reduction in the boiling incipience superheat is observed for the nanostructured samples. Additionally, nanostructured samples having a thicker copper coating provided a considerable increase in dryout heat flux, supporting heat fluxes up to 457 W/cm^ 2 from a 5 mm x 5 mm heat input area, while maintaining lower surface superheat temperatures compared to a bare sintered powder sample; this enhancement is attributed primarily to the improved surface wettability. Dynamic contact angle measurements are conducted to quantitatively compare the surface wetting trends for varying copper coating thicknesses and confirm the increase in hydrophilicity with increasing coating thickness...|$|R
40|$|The trochoidal-gear {{technology}} has been growing in groundbreaking fields. Forthcoming applications are demanding to this technology a step forward in the conceiving stage of positive displacement machines. The compendium of the qualities and the inherent characteristics of trochoidal-gear technology, especially towards the gerotor pump, together with scale/size factor and magnetic-driven transmission {{has led to the}} idea of a magnet-sleeve-sealed variable flow mini trochoidal-gear pump. From its original concept, to the last phase of the design development, the proof of concept, this new product will intend to overcome problems such as noise, vibration, maintenance, materials, and dimensions. The paper aims to show the technological path followed from the concept, design, and model, to the manufacture of the first prototype, where the theoretical and numerical approaches are not always directly reflected in the prototype performance results. Early in the design process, from a standard-commercial sintered metal mini trochoidal-gear unit, fundamental characteristics and dimensional limitations have been evaluated becoming the strategic parameters that led to its configuration. The main technical challenge to confront is being sealed with non-exterior driveshaft, ensuring that the whole interior is filled and <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> working <b>fluid</b> and helping the hydrodynamic film formation, the pumping effect, and the heat dissipation. Subsequently, the mini pump architecture, embodiment, methodology, materials, and manufacture are presented. The trend of applications of polymer composite materials and their benefits wanted to be examined with this new mini pump prototype, and a pure polyoxymethylene mini trochoidal-gear set has been designed and manufactured. Finally, both the sintered and the polymer trochoidal-gear units have been experimentally tested in an in-house full-instrumented mini test bench. Although the main goal of the presented work is the development of a new mini trochoidal-gear pump prototype rather than a numerical study, the results have been compared with numerical simulation. Subsequently, the prototype of the mini trochoidal-gear pump is a feasible proof of concept supported by functional indexes and the experimental results.

40|$|Fission Power Systems {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as potential multi-kilowatt power solutions for lunar, Martian, and extended planetary surface missions. Current heat rejection technology associated with fission surface power systems has focused on titanium water thermosyphons embedded in carbon composite radiator panels. The thermosyphons, or wickless heat pipes, are used as a redundant and efficient way to spread the waste heat from the power conversion unit(s) over the radiator surface area {{where it can be}} rejected to space. It is well known that thermosyphon performance is reliant on gravitational forces to keep the evaporator <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> the working <b>fluid.</b> One of the performance limits that can be encountered, if not understood, is the phenomenon of condenser flooding, otherwise known as evaporator dry out. This occurs when the gravity forces acting on the condensed fluid cannot overcome the shear forces created by the vapor escaping the evaporator throat. When this occurs, the heat transfer process is stalled and may not re-stabilize to effective levels without corrective control actions. The flooding limit in earth's gravity environment is well understood as experimentation is readily accessible, but when the environment and gravity change relative to other planetary bodies, experimentation becomes difficult. An innovative experiment was designed and flown on a parabolic flight campaign to achieve the Reduced Gravity Environments (RGE) needed to obtain empirical data for analysis. The test data is compared to current correlation models for validation and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Spray cooling is a {{powerful}} heat transfer technique in which an atomizing nozzle provides a flow of liquid droplets directed towards a hot surface. This dissertation explores two potentially powerful techniques capable of improving traditional spray cooling: nanofluids and extended surfaces. Nanofluids were experimentally studied in a pool boiling system to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of critical heat flux (CHF) enhancement. Dilute suspensions of nanoparticles {{were found to have}} a degrading or no effect on boiling performance. Greater concentrations (≥ 0. 5 g/L) lead to modest (up to ~ 37 %) increase in the CHF. The results were highly dependent on the working fluid/substrate combination, specifically wetting characteristics. Poorly wetting systems (e. g. water on copper) could be enhanced by nanofluids, whereas better wetting systems (e. g. ethanol on glass) showed no improvement. This conclusion was re-enforced when nanofouling caused by dryout of nanofluid was found to improve wetting as shown by a reduction in the advancing threephase contact angle. Interestingly, similar CHF enhancement was achieved without nanofluids using an oxidized surface, which is easily <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> pure <b>fluids.</b> In fact, surface treatment alone resulted in similar CHF enhancement at ~ 20 °C less wall superheat than required using nanofluids. Spray cooling was found to be adversely affected by the addition of nanoparticles due to changing thermophysical properties and/or nozzle clogging due to particle deposition. The addition of high aspect ratio open microchannels to the sprayed surface resulted in significant enhancement at all wall superheats and over 200 % enhancement in the low temperature single-phase regime. The two-phase regime began at lower temperatures with microchannels, which lead to heat transfer enhancements of up to 181 %. The onset of two-phase effects was found to be a strong function of channel depth. However, the onset of two-phase effects was found to occur at a temperature that was independent of nozzle pressure/mass flow rate. Therefore, nucleation and two-phase effects are likely triggered by the unique liquid distribution caused by the extended structures. Using high aspect ratio open microchannels, these mechanisms resulted in spray efficiencies approaching one, indicating almost complete utilization of the spray's ability to absorb heat...|$|R
