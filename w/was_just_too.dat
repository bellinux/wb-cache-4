Hambleton and Clark would have to spend another night behind the front lines. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E

Moreover, this law merely allowed {{the transfer of the}} landlordism from one area to another. This was because landlords were paid in bonds, which he could use to purchase agricultural lands. Likewise, the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the leasehold arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.|$|E

25|$|Brown and Bedser {{deserved}} {{at least}} two day's rest – but the whole English side {{was in and out}} while the sun was still shining. One of the saddest sights I have seen on a cricket field was the weary Bedser trudging out to bat less than two hours after his marathon bowling effort...Bailey batted one handed and Wright did not bat. It was a sickening blow for the Englishmen, to lose by an innings after such heroic efforts by the bowlers, but Iverson <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> good.|$|E
25|$|Schooled {{mostly in}} one-room schools, Bascom quit school while in grade three {{to work on}} the Hyssop 5H Ranch, east of Lethbridge. It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> young looking to be a {{seasoned}} cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old stagecoach pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to and from school.|$|E
25|$|Previously BRIC {{was coined}} by Jim O'Neill in 2001 as an acronym of 4 {{countries}} {{which are all}} deemed {{to be at a}} similar stage of newly advanced economic development, but in 2009 the leaders of BRIC countries made the first summit and in 2010 BRIC became a formal institution. South Africa began efforts to join the BRIC grouping and on December 24, 2010 South Africa was invited to join BRICS. The aim of BRIC is establishment of an equitable, democratic and multi polar world order, but later BRIC became a political organization, moreover after South Africa joined BRICS. Jim O'Neill, told the summit that South Africa, at a population of under 50 million people, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> small as an economy to join the BRIC ranks.|$|E

25|$|Cutolo’s NCO {{became more}} {{powerful}} by encroaching and taking over other group’s territories. The NCO {{was able to}} break the circle of traditional power held by the families. Cutolo’s organisation <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> aggressive and violent to be resisted by any individual families. Other Camorra families initially were too weakened, too divided, and simply too intimidated by the NCO. He requested that if other criminal groups wanted to keep their business, they had to pay the NCO protection on all their activities, including a percentage for each carton of cigarettes smuggled into Naples. This practice {{came to be known}} as ICA (Imposta Camorra Aggiunta – or Camorristic Sale Tax), mimicking the state VAT sale tax IVA (Imposta sul Valore Aggiunto). For instance, Michele Zaza, the biggest Neapolitan cigarette smuggler, was reported to have paid the NCO more than 4 billion lire in the first three months after the imposition of the racket.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to {{find someone}} who could sing backup vocals. Evans {{described}} disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, [...] "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much of a nice guy." [...] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.|$|E
500|$|Harrison later {{recalled}} his {{two months in}} the United States as having been [...] "such a good time", yet [...] "the moment I got back with the Beatles , it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> difficult". These difficulties included having to endure McCartney's habit of dictating how the others should play their instruments and Lennon's increasing withdrawal from the band and emotional dependence on his ever-present partner, Yoko Ono. The couple had recently descended into heroin addiction, leaving Lennon, in author Peter Doggett's words, [...] "emotionally removed and artistically bankrupt". In their study of the Get Back project, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that, as another frustration for Harrison, Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked his compositions, {{even when they were}} [...] "far better than their own".|$|E

500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E

[...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E

[...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E

500|$|In Alexandria, Owumi {{received}} a satisfactory offer from El-Olympi, a local team coached {{by one of}} Azmy's former players. Going against the will of his family, Owumi chose to follow his coach {{because he did not}} want his relatives to see him in his poor physical and mental state, and he felt that he could recover by playing basketball. He said, [...] "The real reason why I didn't come home was I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> raw. You know, I would look in the mirror, and I couldn't recognize myself." [...] He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma from Libya. However, during his stint, his father fell into a diabetic coma, giving Owumi additional stress. The Nigerian finished the final two weeks of the season with El-Olympi. He led his new team to 13 straight wins, won the championship, and was named postseason MVP.|$|E

[...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just to fuck with Jenny's head. As if Jenny's head needed the encouragement".|$|E
