500|$|Woodall came to {{prominence}} as co-host and fashion advisor for five {{series of the}} BBC television series <b>What</b> Not <b>to</b> <b>Wear.</b> She and Constantine worked on the show from 2001 to 2005, combining their knowledge of fashion to improve the dress sense of the candidates selected for the show. <b>What</b> Not <b>to</b> <b>Wear</b> made Woodall a household name, and she and Constantine became jointly known as Trinny and Susannah. They became infamous for their straight-talking advice. The New York Times wrote [...] "Trinny Woodall, one of the upper-crusty and scathingly blunt hosts of <b>What</b> Not <b>to</b> <b>Wear,</b> a hugely popular fashion makeover show on the BBC, does not mince words."

500|$|Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's {{decision}} to award Jenner with a [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman {{could be better}} than [...] "someone who is just born a woman." [...] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for statingin a BuzzFeed interview that the hardest part about being a woman [...] "is figuring out what to wear". McGowan argued: [...] "We are more than deciding <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn {{that we have had}} a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege." [...] McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: [...] "Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism." ...|$|E

While discussing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> for the Mother's Day episode, Verna suggests that Jenna wear an outfit that she made, but Jenna does not want to. Nonetheless, Verna and Jenna make up and wear each other's clothes on the broadcast. Meanwhile, TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) learns that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) does not know where his mother is, so he decides to cast actress Novella Nelson to be his mother for the Mother's Day episode. Tracy and Novella have a dislike to one another, however, the two make amends with each other and sing together on the holiday episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{being the}} series premiere, {{features}} the first {{usage of the}} theme song by pop punk band Nerf Herder. Parry Gripp, the band's songwriter, guitarist, and admitted fan of the show explained that the band created the theme song after [...] "fancy pants Hollywood" [...] failed to write a theme song that the producers approved. Eventually, [...] "they [...] asked a bunch of local, small time bands who they could pay very little money {{to come up with}} some ideas and they liked our idea and they used it." [...] Several songs by the band Sprung Monkey play during the episode. When Buffy is deciding <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear,</b> the song [...] "Saturated" [...] is playing faintly in the background. At The Bronze, the band plays their songs [...] "Believe", [...] "Swirl", and [...] "Things are Changing". All of the songs featured in the episode can be found on their 1995 album Swirl. The score for the episode, as well as all first season entries, was created by Walter Murphy.|$|E

500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear,</b> did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E

[...] However, etiquette for <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> in public in transit to and from black tie occasions was stiffer in earlier eras and remain an option: [...] Matching overcoats are usually black, charcoal, or dark blue, and traditionally of the Chesterfield style. A guards coat was also once popular, and a lighter topcoat can be worn in summer. Historically, an Inverness coat was also worn. Until the mid-20th century, gloves and scarves were always worn, and are still occasionally seen in gray leather and white silk, respectively. [...] White kid gloves have never been standard with black tie, remaining exclusive to white tie dress.|$|E

2500|$|Her 1977 {{appearance}} {{on the cover of}} Time magazine under the banner [...] "Torchy Rock" [...] was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear,</b> Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image {{she did not want to}} project. In 2004, she was interviewed for CBS This Morning and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, [...] "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her Svengali. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about." [...] Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a [...] "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold". Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the Time cover did not appear to help the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to see how she is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to look like this when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Constant Chaos was released, Jones had {{temporarily}} halted activity on his labels {{for almost a}} year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work {{out what to do}} next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled Green Velvet, which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark Whatever, which was a step away from his Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although Sleepwalking had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song When?), drug use (highlighted on Genedefekt and La La Land), alienation (highlighted on Sleepwalking), and being told <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> and do by the system (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track Gat). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of [...] "underground American industrial stuff." [...] He released the single La La Land in 2001, originally designed as a wake-up call for clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by Genedefekt. His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.|$|E
