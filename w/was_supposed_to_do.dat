5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E
25|$|Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He {{was able}} to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife {{returned}} to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a magazine article on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to Dune.|$|E
500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went against everything I <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the camera."

500|$|The game {{received}} strong {{reviews and}} publicity from other video gaming magazines at the time. In a review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment, the presentation and gameplay {{was compared to}} Castlevania, while the cinematic cutscenes were compared favorably to Karateka and other computer games by Cinemaware. The review praised the game's animation in these cutscenes and noted Tecmo's usage of close-ups and body movements. The reviewer {{said that while the}} cutscenes were not fluid, they were effective and entertaining and gave important information as to what the player <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He appreciated that the game had unlimited continues which slightly offset its difficulty, but he criticized it for having overdetailed background graphics especially in the indoor levels, saying that some bottomless pits and items in these levels become slightly camouflaged. From July to October 1989, the game was listed at No. 1 on Electronic Gaming Monthlys [...] "Top Ten Video Games" [...] list; it fell to No. 2 on the list behind Mega Man 2 in the following November issue. In their [...] "Best and Worst of 1989", it received awards for [...] "Best Game of the Year" [...] for the NES and [...] "Best Ending in a Video Game" [...] for all consoles. The staff said that Ninja Gaiden [...] "proved to be an instant winner" [...] with its cinematic cutscenes and unique gameplay. They added that the game's climax was better than some movies' climaxes at the time and that it established continuity for a sequel, which would be released the following year. Later in June 1994, the magazine ranked it at No. 4 in a special list of [...] "Top Ten Most Difficult Games" [...] of all time for all consoles.|$|E

2500|$|In Kosminski's defence, he was {{described}} as harmless in the asylum. He had originally been taken into custody for threatening either his sister or the sister of a witness to his admittance with a knife, and brandished a chair at an asylum attendant in January 1892, but these two incidents are the only known indications of violent behaviour. In the asylum, Kosminski preferred to speak his native language, Yiddish, which indicates that his English may have been poor, {{and that he was}} unable to persuade English-speaking victims into dark alleyways, as the Ripper <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The [...] "canonical five" [...] killings that are most frequently blamed on the Ripper ended in 1888 but Kosminski's movements were not restricted until 1891.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} match Los Psycho Circus faced Los Perros del Mal {{in a tournament}} final to {{determine}} the first ever AAA World Trios Champions. In the match Los Perros del Mal was represented by Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly, the same team that wrestled in the tournament's first round.

Just prior to the start of the match, the two teams agreed to make it an [...] "Extreme match", which meant that much like their many previous matches against each other, this also featured various weapons used by both Los Psycho Circus and Los Perros del Mal. Eventually, Halloween stopped Psycho Clown's top rope hurricanrana attempt with a low blow and dropped him with a top rope Death Valley driver through a table for the win. With their win, Los Perros del Mal were crowned the first ever AAA World Trios Champions.|$|E

[...] "He <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, but then he declined, which was a real shame", Albarn explained to New York magazine. [...] "It's a very dramatic song, very moving. Arabic strings. It's imagining Earth losing its gravitational pull and starting to fall". As it turned out, Humperdinck's manager had listened to the proposed selection and declined the offer for him without his knowing. Humperdinck later stated in an interview that his manager declining the collaboration offer was [...] "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz if he had known they asked. With or without Humperdinck, Albarn insists the tune will eventually be released. [...] "I'm going to finish that off", he said. [...] "It just needs the vocal. We've made contact with Indian singer Asha Bhosle and I think it's definitely going to happen. I'll maybe duet with her; the song has these answering phrases".
