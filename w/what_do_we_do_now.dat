50|$|During {{his early}} {{life as a}} painter - 1930 to 1950 - Weiss was {{influenced}} by old Dutch masters such as Pieter Breughel, and Hieronymus Bosch. After World War II his painting, {{as well as his}} work in film and literature, came under the lasting influence of Surrealism. He taught painting at Stockholm's People's University, and illustrated a Swedish edition of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. In 1952 he joined the Swedish Experimental Film Studio, where he directed several experimental short films, followed by several socially conscious documentary shorts: Gesichter im Schatten (Faces in the Shadow, 1956), Im Namen des Gesetzes (In the Name of the Law, 1957), Was machen wir jetzt? (<b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Now?,</b> 1958). In 1959 he directed his only full length (experimental) film Hägringen (The Disappeared). In the early 1950s, Weiss had begun to write again, producing a number of prose works, some in German, others in Swedish. Most are short, intense, surrealist text which suggest the influence of Kafka (whose work Weiss would later adapt for the stage).|$|E

Waterfront revitalization and resiliency go hand in hand with the restoration of the harbor, protection of the natural environment, and access to the water. A resilient city embraces all waterfront uses and continues to revitalize its waterfront.

40|$|So far, we {{have argued}} that the impact on {{development}} of the consider-able education progress recorded in the region has been less than ex-pected in terms of economic growth, the promotion of equality, and re-duction of poverty. How much of this outcome is the consequence of particular characteristics of the region’s education systems and how much is due to weak linkages between education and labor markets is dif-ficult to discern. We nevertheless conclude that the continuing gap be-tween education and development outcomes may lead policy makers to consider alternative paths of educational development in the future. Furthermore, the conditions under which education systems con-tribute to economic and social development have changed and this also argues for considering alternative paths of education development. The “road not traveled for education reform ” in the MENA region also refers to the fact that education systems must now travel over new and rela-tively unexplored terrain. Education systems have a tendency to spawn a new set of challenges for every problem resolved. Once everyone is in school, we must ensure that they do not drop out. Once they remain seated, we must make sure that they learn something. Once they appear to be ready to learn, we must make sure that the material is useful for their future and ours. Thus, some aspects of the new terrain that educa-tion systems must cross have been shaped by the education system itself. In this context, MENA countries have succeeded in providing most el-igible children with educational opportunities, thus narrowing gender, rural, and socioeconomic gaps in access to schooling. This has led to strains resulting from the maintenance costs of the established education apparatus; new demands for instruction at post-compulsory levels of ed-ucation; and the consequent costs of ongoing inefficiencies: dropouts, low graduate employment, and ambivalent learning outcomes. Essentially, the question facing education authorities in many MENA countries is: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> that we have almost reached education for all...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of this paper the 'user' {{includes}} all those involved in the management of a geothermal resource. The objective of reservoir modelling and simulation, in my view, should be to supply these 'users' with appropriate and reliable data so that they can make sound decisions, whether these be in financial or engineering fields. The scale of models would thus extend from a single w e l l, which may require a workover to remove mineral deposition costing, say, $ 30, 000, to a full geothermal field development, costing more than $ 100 million. Geothermal development work can involve high risks. With the aid of modelling {{it should be possible to}} quantify risks, and, if these are considered excessive, to identify what data should be obtained to reduce them. Schemes relying on a single well are particularly hazardous. In 1974 an alfalfa drying plant was built at Broadlands next to well BR 7. This well had previously been flow tested for three years, showing very reliable discharge characteristics. But when opened to supply the drying plant, the well did not perform satisfactorily and a 350 m pipeline was built to supply steam from another nearby productive w e l l. A l l geothermal developments involve drilling and this, also, is a risky business. In New Zealand, over the last six years, the time to drill a 1200 - 1400 m investigation well shows variations of 240 % about the average (using the same rig and equipment). The time for workovers is even more variable, due to unforeseen downhole conditions affecting progress - an overrun of 100 % would not be unexpected. What information does the user want? Basic data w i l l be the power-life and likely discharge characteristics of a field given certain operating conditions. For example, i f we have a liquid dominated field, the design engineers w i l l require information about changing enthalpy, gas and total flow for the system as a whole and for each individual well. There is no point in fitting a well with equipment to handle 100 t/h of separated steam if, after three years' production, it will only produce 50 t/h. Those providing finance for a scheme will require an assurance of its viability. How many years can the field sustain the projected withdrawal rate? For a well repair operation, those providing funds will want to know the chances of success and how much steam the well might produce if the operation succeeds. These factors must be balanced against the estimated cost of the operation, which itself identified in the first place. In a field which has been operating for some years, the question arises: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now?</b> Do we increase production, or do nothing, or maybe manage the field by operating only selected wells. Whatever the choice, predictions of future field and well performance are required to allow the field operator to evaluate the economics of alternative schemes...|$|E
