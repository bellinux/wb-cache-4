2500|$|There {{has been}} debate over {{what kinds of}} damage may have {{resulted}} from the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's identity as a CIA operative in Novak's column and its fallout, how far and into what areas of national security and foreign intelligence that damage might extend, particularly vis-à-vis Plame's work with her cover company, Brewster Jennings & Associates. Plame has characterized the damage as [...] "serious", noting, [...] "I can tell you, all the intelligence services {{in the world that}} morning were running my name through their databases to see, `Did anyone by this name come in the country? When? Do we know anything about it? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> stay? Well, who did she see?'" [...] In an op-ed published by the Los Angeles Times, Joe Wilson wrote [...] "She immediately started jotting down a checklist of things she needed to do to limit the damage to people she knew and to projects she was working on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You needn't mind {{sending up}} to me, {{if the child}} cries, nurse,' said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very likely it will be troublesome.

6000|$|Her {{voice was}} enough to show me what she thought.

I knew from my own inspection how bleak and bare a room it was. She certainly did not live there. But in that case <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come from? It could not be anyone of the household. They were all under the vigilant eyes of Mrs. Stevens. The visitor must come from without. But how? ...|$|E
60|$|The first {{excitement}} having worn itself out, {{a perfect}} volley of questions followed. What was the lady's name? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> live? How had {{she got the}} necklace? Had it been given to her? and, if so, who had given it? Where had it been made? Why had she {{brought it to the}} Judengasse? Did she want to sell it? or to borrow money on it? Aha! To borrow money on it. Very good, very good indeed; but--and then the detestable invitation to produce the reference made itself heard once more.|$|E

6000|$|As Mr. Clinch {{shouted out}} the last words, {{confused}} cries of recognition and welcome, not unmixed with some consternation, rose from the battlements: [...] "Ach Gott!" [...] "Mutter Gott--it is he! It is Jann, Der Wanderer. It is himself." [...] The chains rattled, the ponderous drawbridge creaked and dropped; and across it a medley of motley figures rushed pellmell. But, foremost among them, the very maiden whom he had left not ten minutes before flew into his arms, and with a cry of joyful greeting sank upon his breast. Mr. Clinch looked down upon the fair head and long braids. It certainly was the same maiden, his cruel enchantress; but <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> get those absurd garments? ...|$|E
6000|$|To the {{psychologist}} who objects that our modern instances are mere anecdotes, we reply by asking, 'Dear sir, {{what are your}} modern instances? What {{do you know of}} [...] "Mrs. A.," [...] whom you still persistently cite as an example of morbid recurrent hallucinations? Name the German servant girl who, in a fever, talked several learned languages, which she had heard her former master, a scholar, declaim! <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> live? Who vouches for her, who heard her, who understood her? There is, you know, no evidence at all; the anecdote is told by Coleridge: the phenomena are said by him to have been observed [...] "in a Roman Catholic town in Germany, a year or two before my arrival at Göttingen.... Many eminent physiologists and psychologists visited the town." [...] Why do you not name a few out of the distinguished crowd?'[8] This anecdote, a rumour of a rumour of a Protestant explanation of a Catholic marvel, was told by Coleridge at least twenty years after the possible date. The psychologists copy it,[9] one after the other, as a flock of sheep jump where their leader has jumped. An example by way of anecdote may be permitted.|$|E
60|$|Who was she? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come from? Wonderingly he {{took his}} eyes off her face to look round at the serried trees of the forest that stood big and still and straight, as if {{watching}} him and her breathlessly. He had been baffled, repelled, almost frightened by the intensity of that tropical life which wants the sunshine but works in gloom; {{which seems to be}} all grace of colour and form, all brilliance, all smiles, but is only the blossoming of the dead; whose mystery holds the promise of joy and beauty, yet contains nothing but poison and decay. He had been frightened by the vague perception of danger before, but now, as he looked at that life again, his eyes seemed able to pierce the fantastic veil of creepers and leaves, to look past the solid trunks, to see through the forbidding gloom--and the mystery was disclosed--enchanting, subduing, beautiful. He looked at the woman. Through the checkered light between them she appeared to him with the impalpable distinctness of a dream. The very spirit of that land of mysterious forests, standing before him like an apparition behind a transparent veil--a veil woven of sunbeams and shadows.|$|E

No, she warn't up at the house now. Well, then, lookee here. The lady was upon a journey all alone, strange as we might think it, and could she rest herself where you're a setten for a hour or so. Yes she could, and so she did.

6000|$|The Clavering {{family had}} indeed made a false start in life, and had got neither conduct, nor position, nor {{thanks for the}} hospitalities which they administered, nor a return of {{kindness}} from the people whom they entertained. The success of their first London season was doubtful; and their failure afterwards notorious. [...] "Human patience was not great enough {{to put up with}} Sir Francis Clavering," [...] people said. [...] "He was too hopelessly low, dull, and disreputable. You could not say what, but there was a taint about the house and its entourages. Who was the Begum, with her money, and without her h's, and <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come from? What an extraordinary little piece of conceit the daughter was, with her Gallicised graces and daring affectations, not fit for well-bred English girls to associate with! What strange people were those they assembled round about them! Sir Francis Clavering was a gambler, living notoriously in the society of blacklegs and profligates. Hely Clinker, who was in his regiment, said that he not only cheated at cards, but showed the white feather. What could Lady Rockminster have meant by taking her up? After the first season, indeed, Lady Rockminster, who had taken up Lady Clavering, put her down; the great ladies would not take their daughters to her parties; the young men who attended them behaved with the most odious freedom and scornful familiarity; and poor Lady Clavering herself avowed that she was obliged to take what she called 'the canal' into her parlour, because the tip-tops wouldn't come." ...|$|E
6000|$|Either the {{reluctance}} {{is from the}} natural desire that so recent a heroine should be founded on fact, or it is mere perverseness. Perhaps I ought to say; in justice to her, {{that it was one}} of her own sex who refused to be interested in her, and forbade Basil to care for her. When he had read of her exploit from the guide-book, Isabel asked him if he had noticed that handsome girl in the blue and white striped Garibaldi and Swiss hat, who had come aboard at Kingston. She pointed her out, and courageously made him admire her beauty, which was of the most bewitching Canadian type. The young girl was redeemed by her New World birth from the English heaviness; a more delicate bloom lighted her cheeks; a softer grace dwelt in her movement; yet she was round and full, and she was in the perfect flower of youth. She was not so ethereal in her loveliness as an American girl, but she was not so nervous and had none of the painful fragility of the latter. Her expression was just a little vacant, it must be owned; but so far as she went she was faultless. She looked like the most tractable of daughters, and as if she would be the most obedient of wives. She had a blameless taste in dress, Isabel declared; her costume of blue and white striped Garibaldi and Swiss hat (set upon heavy masses of dark brown hair) being completed by a black silk skirt. [...] "And you can see," [...] she added, [...] "that it's an old skirt made over, and that she's dressed as cheaply as she is prettily." [...] This surprised Basil, who had imputed the young lady's personal sumptuousness to her dress, and had thought it enormously rich. When she got off with her chaperone at one of the poorest-looking country landings, she left them in hopeless conjecture about her. Was she visiting there, or was the interior of Canada full of such stylish and exquisite creatures? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> get her taste, her fashions, her manners? As she passed from sight towards the shadow of the woods, they felt the poorer for her going; yet they were glad to have seen her, and on second thoughts they felt that they could not justly ask more of her than to have merely existed for a few hours in their presence. They perceived that beauty was not only its own excuse for being, but that it flattered and favored and profited the world by consenting to be.|$|E
