5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
25|$|This is Richard's CD. My only {{knowledge}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the studio}} {{was how he}} seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E
25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I {{think it would be}} a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end I wrote mine." ...|$|E

500|$|Ricki-Lee Dawn Coulter {{was born}} on 10 November 1985 in Auckland, New Zealand. Her mother Loretta Sheerin, of Māori descent, was a model. Coulter's parents {{separated}} before she was born, and she was raised by her mother. Coulter and her mother relocated to Gold Coast, Queensland when she was three months old. Coulter's father figure {{at the time was}} her grandfather Rocky. Coulter's mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child. [...] "He wasn't a part of my life. I'd go over there and stay with him and his family, [...] it was just weird to me. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> an age where I could speak up to Mum, about six or seven, I said, 'I don't want to go; I don't like it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> see the carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to}} be designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel right at home with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{was born}} in New York City, New York in 1985 and was raised in Lake Placid, a quiet village outside of New York. At age fifteen, she was sent to {{boarding}} school in Connecticut, before moving to New York City at eighteen to study metaphysics at Fordham University. While attending the university, according to Del Rey, her musical experience began here, discovering the right acquaintances on her own. After her uncle {{taught her how to}} play guitar, she realized that she could probably write [...] "a million" [...] songs with only those six chords. She then began performing in clubs in New York City, using various stage names such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena. Recalling the experience, Del Rey said, [...] "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn – I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point – and that was it".|$|E

500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut her throat two or three times. This was across her throat. The knife was in my left hand.

2500|$|About the goal, Maradona said, [...] "I {{made the}} play {{to give it}} to Valdano, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the area they {{surrounded}} me and I had no space.

[...] He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, [...] "I don't think I could have done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world".|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Grass {{published}} {{an account of}} his wartime experience in The New Yorker, including an attempt to [...] "string together the circumstances that probably triggered and nourished my decision to enlist." [...] To the BBC, Grass said in 2006: [...] "It happened as it did to many of my age. We were in the labour service and all at once, a year later, the call-up notice lay on the table.

2500|$|En {{route to}} Washington, D.C., {{he stopped at}} the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, Maryland, where a mimeographed {{publication}} titled Army Motors was put together.

2500|$|While {{a student}} at the University of California, Berkeley at age seventeen, Stuart wanted to join the Young Communist League.

[...] In Carmel, she notes that her friendship with muckraker Lincoln Steffens gave her [...] "...much deeper insight into the abuses of laborers and blue-collar workers and made me ready to work for liberal causes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood a few years later." ...|$|E
