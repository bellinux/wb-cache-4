5000|$|In the 1950s {{more than}} one French {{aircraft}} design was tested with larger scale glider models than could be put into <b>wind-tunnels.</b> These were piloted and launched {{from the top of}} a large aircraft like a SNCASE Languedoc, as was the SCAN 271 or alternatively towed to altitude. [...] The Arsenal 2301 was a full-scale model of a proposed rocket powered fighter aircraft which developed German ideas on swept wing aircraft expressed in the wartime DFS 346. It was a wooden aircraft, with swept, straight tapered mid-wings, square tipped at right angles to the leading edge. The fuselage was long and fine, with the cockpit well forward of the wing. The fuselage began to taper to the pointed nose just behind the canopy. The vertical tail was swept, straight tipped and tapered, though there was a curved fillet between the fin root and the fuselage. An all-moving tail, straight tapered, square tipped and with sweep on its leading edge, was placed about one-third the way up the fin. [...] The 2301 had a bicycle landing gear, with a fixed main wheel under the central fuselage and a small, retractable nose wheel; retracting stabilizing wheels were positioned near the wing tips. Its span was 8 m and length 14 m. Its primary purpose was to explore the low speed characteristics of the design.|$|E
5000|$|The FG01 {{had many}} influences. Its roots dated back to [...] when former Brabham {{designer}} Rinland left the British team {{before the season}} ended. Rinland set up Astauto Ltd. in Tolworth, England, hiring several of his former collaborators from Brabham when the team closed its doors. Brabham sold the building and wind tunnel at Chessington to Yamaha, facilities that Astauto rented to develop the new Fondmetal GR02, which was designed and built by June 1992, just six months after it was commissioned by Gabriele Rumi. The Fondmetal GR02 was a natural successor of the Brabham BT60, in concept, as it was conceived by the same design team. Due to Fondmetal's own severe financial troubles, the GR02 was run only in a few races before the team was closed. When in late , Forti bought {{the remains of the}} Fondmetal Team, acquiring all the spares of the GR02 in the process, the team then turned to Rinland to purchase the design of what would have been the [...] F1 car design by the Astauto Design Team {{after the collapse of the}} Fondmetal team. At that time, Rinland was living and working in California on a new ChampCar project. Forti sent his Chief Designer and former Astauto employee Chris Radage to California to gather all the technical information, data and drawings from Rinland, returning to Italy to design and develop the new Forti FG01. Rinland joined the team in early 1995 for a short period as Technical Director, once he had returned to Europe. Rinland assisted experienced Italian engineers Giorgio Stirano and Giacomo Caliri in designing the car. The car's aerodynamics were completed by former Brabham employee Hans Fouche using <b>wind-tunnels</b> in South Africa, and composite work was done by the Belco Avia company. However, it was rumoured that the FG01 was little more than a re-working of the GR02.|$|E

A newwind-tunnel has been designed, constructed and evaluated at theDept. of Mechanics, KTH. Special attention was directed to thedesign of turning vanes that not only turn the flow but alsoallow for a large expansion without separation in the corners. The investigation of the flow quality confirmed that theconcept of expanding corners is feasible and may besuccessfully incorporated into low turbulence <b>wind-tunnels.</b> Theflow quality in the MTL wind-tunnel at the Dept. of Mechanics,KTH, was as also in investigated confirming that it still isvery good. The results are in general comparable to thosemeasured when the tunnel was as new, {{with the exception of}} thetemperature variation ariation that has decreased by a factorof 4 due to an improved cooling system. Experimental data from high Reynolds number zeropressure-gradient turbulent layers have been investigated. These studies have primarily focused on scaling laws withe. g. confirmation of an exponential velocity defect lawin a region, about half the size of the boundary layerthickness, located outside the logarithmic overlap region. Thestreamwise velocity probability density functions in theoverlap region was found to be self-similar when scaled withthe local rms value. Flow structures in the near-wall andbuffer regions were studied ande. g. the near-wall streak spacing was confirmed to beabout 100 viscous length units although the relative influenceof the near-wall streaks on the flow was as found to decreasewith increasing Reynolds number. The separated flow in an asymmetric plane diffuser wasdetermined using PIV and LDV. All three velocity componentswere measured in a plane along the centerline of the diffuser.
