5|$|The botched arrest attempt <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> {{disastrous}} for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented {{invasion of the}} chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege.

Vladislav {{obtained}} the remains and buried them in the Mileševa monastery, which he had built intended to be his burial place.

5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E

Later, he hosted a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on {{a new generation of}} ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers.

5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7.

The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E

5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if {{it could not be}} used for offensive operations. This <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> embarrassing for the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be employed.|$|E
5|$|After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia <b>was</b> <b>politically</b> rehabilitated in 1979, but {{was unable}} to return to the stage because of her disability. Her {{performance}} in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994.

Until the winter of 1864, the town's location in a mountainous region had protected it from major fighting. In November 1864, George Stonemandeputy commander of the Department of the Ohio and in charge of all Union cavalry units in eastern Tennesseeproposed an expedition into southwest Virginia to disrupt the production of supplies and facilities beneficial to the Confederacy. This gained the approval of Maj. Gen. John Schofield on December 6, 1864.|$|E
