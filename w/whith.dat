Hodnotím Mn ocel z hlediska struktury a její vlastnosti vytvrzovat při obrábění (soustružení, frézování), což vyžaduje speciální metody při opracování. Obecně se zmiňuji o soustružení a frézování, kde jsem se soustředil hlavně na použití nejvhodnějších břitových destiček do obráběcích strojů. Popisuji výrobu destiček ze SK několikrát povlakovaných, které se nejlépe osvědčily při opracování konkrétních výrobků. Jedná se o srdcovky pro železnice a o kužely drtících mlýnů ve Slévárnách Třinec. Z parametrů použitých břitových destiček firmy PRAMET, které jsou z kubických karbidů a jsou opatřeny multivrstevnatým nanostrukturním povlakem, a z naměřených hodnot při frézování a soustružení jsem vypočítal náklady na frézování a soustružení. Tyto výsledky jsem porovnal z dřívějšími hodnotami při použití jiných břitových destiček z CBN a SK a stanovil úspory při novém způsobu opracování.
