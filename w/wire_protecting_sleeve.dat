Also on 1 April, Plan Alamo was implemented to utilize {{and defend the}} DAO compound and its annex as an evacuee holding area, intended to care for 1,500 evacuees for five days. By 16 April, Alamo was complete: water, C-rations, petroleum, oil and lubricants had been stockpiled, backup electricity generators had been installed, sanitary facilities were completed, and concertina <b>wire</b> <b>protected</b> the perimeter.|$|R
30|$|In this study, the {{selected}} method of fixation was to apply transfixing K <b>wires</b> <b>protected</b> with a hip spica cast {{for an average}} duration of 6  weeks. Transfixing K wires are versatile, malleable tools for stable fixation, even with larger angles of correction that cannot usually be addressed using plates without contouring them {{to such an extent}} that the plate strength may be comprised. The application of transfixing K wires requires less dissection, thus allowing the soft tissues around the proximal femur above the level of the trochanteric flare to be largely preserved and decreasing the healing time, it also completely avoids violating the femoral neck affording marked protection to the precious growth plate.|$|R

500|$|During this attack, {{the leading}} brigades of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division {{advanced}} {{to conform to}} the 181st Brigade's advance. As a consequence of accurate shrapnel fire the 231st Brigade moved slightly to the right forcing the 230th Brigade (on the left), to fill the gap with two supporting companies of the 10th Buffs. As the 74th (Yeomanry) Division's advance approached the Ottoman trenches, heavy machine-gun fire slowed their progress. By 10:40, the 231st Brigade was within [...] of the front line; the 230th Brigade was about [...] behind. These advances (and the capture of Hill 1070) made it possible for the EEF's heavy guns to move forward, to target barbed <b>wire</b> <b>protecting</b> the main Ottoman defensive line and Ottoman observation posts.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of the German Nahkampfmesser or (close combat knife), most early trench knives were fabricated by hand by individual soldiers or ordnance blacksmiths for the purpose of silently eliminating sentries and other enemy personnel during trench raids. [...] These early [...] "trench knives" [...] were often nothing more than shortened and sharpened Army-issue bayonets. One type of stabbing weapon, the French Nail, was made by cutting and pointing the steel stakes used to support the ubiquitous barbed <b>wire</b> <b>protecting</b> the trench lines. All trench knives share one common characteristic: they were designed specifically for military use in close combat encounters with enemy personnel. Some historians say that some trench knives models were inspired by the Bowie knife for its design.|$|R

40|$|The wire-shadow {{technique}} {{is a simple}} and easy-to-use preparation method of cross-section specimens for TEM investigations. The method has been optimised for thin films on silicon and oxide (sapphire, MgO) substrates. A wire is glued onto the films. During thinning in a modified commercial ion-milling sample holder {{the shadow of the}} small <b>wire</b> <b>protects</b> part of the film. Non-shadowed areas of film and substrate are removed by ion sputtering. During ion thinning a sharp edge evoves in the wire shadow. As a consequence, the interface between film and substrate becomes transparent to electrons just at {{the point at which the}} wire is eroded away. Different wire materials and thinning geometries were tested. The best results were achieved using an amorphous carbon fibre with a diameter of 7 mu m...|$|R
5000|$|The NEC also permits grounding-type {{receptacles}} in non-grounded <b>wiring</b> <b>protected</b> by a GFCI. The 1999 Code {{required that}} new 240 Volt receptacles be grounded also, which necessitates a fourth slot in their faces. These standards changes often cause problems for electrical work in older buildings.Unlike circuit breakers and fuses, which only open the circuit {{when the current}} exceeds a fixed value for a fixed time, a GFCI device will interrupt electrical service when more than 4 to 6 milliamperes of current in either conductor leaks to ground. A GFCI detects an imbalance between the current in the [...] "hot" [...] side and the current in the [...] "neutral" [...] side. One GFCI receptacle can serve as protection for several downstream conventional receptacles. GFCI devices come in many configurations including circuit-breakers, portable devices and receptacles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wires</b> must be <b>protected</b> from sharp {{metal edges}} of cut {{conduits}} or cabinet holes. The NEC specifies measures to <b>protect</b> <b>wire</b> insulation from damage by these edges during installation and use. For example, insulated cables {{may not be}} inserted directly through knockouts, due to the sharp edge around nearly all knockout holes. Clamping and other wire protection is often not required for plastic conduit parts, as plastic {{is not likely to}} damage insulation in contact with it.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a spin-orbit coupled {{semiconductor}} nanowire with Zeeman splitting and s-wave superconductivity is in symmetry class BDI (not D as is commonly thought) of the topological classification of band Hamiltonians. The class BDI allows for an integer Z topological invariant equal {{to the number of}} Majorana fermion (MF) modes {{at each end of the}} quantum <b>wire</b> <b>protected</b> by the chirality symmetry (reality of the Hamiltonian). Thus it is possible for this system (and all other d= 1 models related to it by symmetry) to have an arbitrary integer number, not just 0 or 1 as is commonly assumed, of MFs localized at each end of the wire. The integer counting the number of MFs at each end reduces to 0 or 1, and the class BDI reduces to D, in the presence of terms in the Hamiltonian that break the chirality symmetry.

5000|$|Many of the {{predominantly}} reinforced concrete structures {{are no longer}} extant, the recorded defences include: coastal beach defence batteries, with 4.7-inch gun batteries, other gun emplacements, numerous pillboxes, road blocks and road and railway antitank obstacles, including extensive anti-tank cubes on the beach, Royal Observer Corps posts, weapons pits and/or infantry trenches, barbed <b>wire</b> <b>protected</b> trackways and Army camps and associated facilities, including a camp [...] "Rolston camp", located east of the Hornsea Bridge suburb on ground now destroyed by coastal erosion, with associated infantry trenches, grenade ranges, strongpoints and minefields, some farm buildings were also fortified. Other Second World War structures also included air raid shelters, and 'Diver' anti-aircraft battery designed to destroy V1 flying bombs.By {{the middle of the}} 20th century Hornsea had continued to grow, with new housing built or under construction south of Hornsea Town station, and at the coastal resort.

25|$|In June 1916 the British {{preliminary}} bombardment cut much of {{the barbed}} <b>wire</b> <b>protecting</b> the Mametz defences and destroyed many of the trenches in the first position occupied by Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division. When the 7th Division advanced behind a creeping barrage, {{much of the}} German front line was quickly overrun and many prisoners taken; delays further forward caused the infantry to lag behind the barrage and suffer far more casualties. Mametz was occupied during the morning by the 20th Brigade but a German counter-attack forced most of the British troops out, until a second attack during the afternoon, when the advance of the 18th (Eastern) Division on the right flank, had cut the Germans in the village off from Montauban to the east. The German defence collapsed and the 7th Division reached all its objectives {{on the right and}} in the centre and began to consolidate, ready to receive a German counter-attack.|$|R
50|$|Flexible, flat cables {{are used}} in place of round cables for easy cable management, {{especially}} in high-flex applications. They usually take up less space than round cables, often offering better EMI/RFI suppression and eliminating wire-coupling issues. In addition, because the <b>wires</b> are <b>protected</b> individually and not wrapped many times over by different materials as round cables are, they are lighter in weight and offer greater flexibility.|$|R

50|$|Inside the package, {{the lower}} half has the leads embedded, and {{at the center of}} the package is a {{rectangular}} space, chamber, or void into which the IC die is cemented. The leads of the package extend diagonally inside the package from their positions of emergence along the periphery to points along a rectangular perimeter surrounding the die, tapering as they go to become fine contacts at the die. Ultra-fine bond wires (barely visible to the naked human eye) are welded between these die periphery contacts and bond pads on the die itself, connecting one lead to each bond pad, and making the final connection between the microcircuits and the external DIP leads. The bond wires are not usually taut but loop upward slightly to allow slack for thermal expansion and contraction of the materials; if a single bond wire breaks or detaches, the entire IC may become useless. The top of the package covers all of this delicate assemblage without crushing the bond <b>wires,</b> <b>protecting</b> it from contamination by foreign materials.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{was born}} in Bradford, Wiltshire in Southern England, the son of Francis Glass. He was educated at King's College London. [...] In 1846 with George Elliot, he {{provided}} capital for an insolvent wire-rope manufacturers Heimann & Kuper, and by 1851 the firm was trading as Glass, Elliott & Company. The company produced submarine communications cables and in 1854 ran a circuit from Denmark to Sweden and undertook the manufacture of long cables for the French Mediterranean Telegraph Company of J W Brett. The cables with a resin-insulated conducting <b>wire</b> <b>protected</b> by an armour of iron wire proved to be very long-lasting, and in the later 1850s the company introduced anti-corrosive compounds to coat the finished cable. The firm merged with the Gutta-Percha Company in 1864, and Glass became {{managing director of the}} resulting Telegraph Construction & Maintenance Company. Glass's company provided half of the first Transatlantic telegraph cable and all the cable laid by the Great Eastern in 1866. Glass was knighted for these services on 26 November 1867.|$|R
5000|$|Brillant {{volunteered for}} service with the 89th (Temiscouata and Rimouski) Regiment (from 1920 the Fusiliers du St-Laurent) {{and held the}} rank of lieutenant. In 1916, eager to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he {{declared}} 13 years' service with this unit. On 20 March 1916 Brillant left {{his job as a}} telegrapher. After about six months’ training in Valcartier, he embarked for England with the 189th on 27 September 1916; on disembarking at Liverpool on 6 October, he was assigned to the 69th Infantry Battalion. He left for France on 27 October and joined the 22e Battalion (Canadien Francais) at Bully-Grenay. During the night of 27/28 May 1918, in the vicinity of Boiry-Becquerelle, Brillant was called to lead a group of volunteers to help silence an outpost defended by about 50 men. Troops charged the enemy position, cut through the barbed <b>wire</b> <b>protecting</b> it, and took it. He was injured in the attack, yet captured enemy soldiers who had [...] "valuable information". Remaining in action that day despite his wounds, Brillant would be awarded the Military Cross on 16 September 1918.|$|R

25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed <b>wire</b> <b>protecting</b> enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small circular saw, driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of caterpillar tracks was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small circular saw was replaced by a large vertical saw with thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal circular saw was added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large deflection shields being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|R
