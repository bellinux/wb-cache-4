5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
5|$|Yen {{described}} the {{role as the}} most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career. He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day, training in Wing Chun, and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the hopes of portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun. Yen even {{went as far as}} to stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns. While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye. Yen also had a masseur on set as he could not raise his right shoulder due to an injury.|$|E

These manuscripts included original string quartets, sonatas, nocturnes, and other orchestral forms written by Edgar during his music conservatory days.|$|E

25|$|Whilst this {{match was}} {{designated}} as a timeless Test, the ship that was due to take the tourists to New Zealand was set to depart {{on the morning of}} 4 January. The authorities pushed back the departure time to 3:45 pm in the hope that match would yield a result. However, it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> vain as after 55 overs bowled in the 4th innings Australia were still 156 runs short of their target with three wicket down.

25|$|The Knights {{scored on}} seven {{of their first}} eight possessions, jumping out to an early 21–0 lead. Late in the second quarter, Rutgers {{executed}} a fake punt for a gain of 38 yards, which led to their first touchdown of the game. With 41 {{seconds left in the}} half, Rutgers blocked a UCF punt, recovering it in the endzone for a touchdown. The Knights took a 28–14 lead into halftime. The second half <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> favor of UCF. A touchdown in the fourth quarter put the game well out of reach, and the Knights lengthened their winning streak to six straight.|$|E
25|$|Waller's army tried its best, {{but some}} of its {{elements}} were of doubtful quality and the ground <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> Maurice's favour. The Battle of Roundway Down did not last long. The combined attack of the Oxford force from Roundway and of Hopton's men from the town practically annihilated Waller's army. Very soon afterwards, Rupert came up with fresh Royalist forces, and the combined armies moved westward. Bristol, the second port of the kingdom, was their objective. On 26 July, four days from {{the opening of the}} siege, it was in their hands. Waller, with the beaten remnant of his army at Bath, was powerless to intervene. The effect of this blow was felt even in Dorset. Within three weeks of the surrender, Maurice, with a body of fast-moving cavalry, overran that county almost unopposed.|$|E

25|$|Karunanidhi always {{appeared}} to prefer his younger son, M. K. Stalin, {{former mayor of}} Chennai and former Deputy Chief minister of Tamil Nadu, for succeeding him {{as the leader of}} Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Azhagiri shifted his base to Madurai during 1989 and did not hold any post officially in the party. In spite of holding no posts, he <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> command in the Madurai region and senior leaders in the party were unhappy about the factionalism created within the party. The DMK general secretary, K Anbazhagan, in 2001, directed the party men to have any contact with Azhagiri. During the period of 2008, Azhagiri was instrumental in the party winning three by-elections, the notable of which was Thirumangalam, where the party won with a massive difference. Based on the victory, Azhagiri was appointed as the organizing secretary of the party for southern districts. Following the by-poll victories in the state, Azhagiri was given the ticket for Madurai Lok Sabha Constituency in 2009 general elections, which he won eventually and later {{went on to become a}} cabinet minister.|$|E
25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in those poor conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E

[...] "These were not people who wrote things down in the computer or in notebooks.

[...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Largely unchanged, the {{structure}} was {{designed in the}} Gothic Revival style by an unknown architect, with masonry-bearing walls with timber framing at the roof and floors, and brownstone foundation walls and exterior door and window trim. The front facade (west, on Norfolk Street) is [...] "stuccoed and scored to simulate smooth-faced ashlar", though the other elevations are faced in brick. Window tracery <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> wood. Much of the original work remains on the side elevations. Characteristically Gothic exterior features include [...] "vertical proportions, pointed arched window openings with drip moldings, three bay facade with towers". Gothic interior features include [...] "ribbed vaulting" [...] and a [...] "tall and lofty rectangular nave and apse." [...] Originally the window over the main door was a circular rose window, and the two front towers had crenellations in tracery, instead of the present plain tops. The square windows below are original, but the former quatrefoil wooden tracery is gone in many cases. The bandcourse of quatrefoil originally extended across the center section of the facade.|$|E
