5|$|Since their inception, U2 have {{developed}} and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound, <b>with</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals. This approach is rooted partly {{in the early}} influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite {{at a time when}} the band was not known for musical proficiency. The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay to craft his distinctive guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately yields a well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, <b>with</b> <b>emphasis</b> <b>on</b> vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock.

Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E
