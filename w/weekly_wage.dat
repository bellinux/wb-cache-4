5|$|In May 2012, the {{unemployment}} rate in Canberra was 3.4% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> in Canberra is $1702 compared with {{the national average of}} $1485.80 (May 2013).|$|E
5|$|Manhattan is the {{economic}} engine of New York City, with its 2.3million workers in 2007 {{drawn from the}} entire New York metropolitan area accounting for almost two-thirds of all jobs in New York City. In {{the first quarter of}} 2014, the average <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> in Manhattan (New York County) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States. Manhattan's workforce is overwhelmingly focused on white collar professions, with manufacturing nearly extinct. Manhattan also has the highest per capita income of any county in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

30|$|Finally, our {{findings}} {{also indicate that}} although contemporaneous levels of cultural diversity strongly and positively affect <b>weekly</b> <b>wages,</b> the impact of previous levels of diversity on <b>weekly</b> <b>wages</b> is not conclusive. This may explain the variation in the literature where some studies report that cultural diversity increases wages across time (Bellini et al. 2013; Ottaviano and Peri 2006) while others do not (Longhi 2013). Future research should explore this further to examine whether the type of data used to construct diversity and the time lag employed {{has an effect on}} the outcome of diversity in studies.|$|R

5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and {{during the war years}} there was a considerable {{increase in}} the membership of the various unions. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Liddell {{became one}} of many players to be offered a {{transfer}} to Colombia by agents representing Independiente Santa Fe and Club Deportivo Los Millonarios. The clubs belonged to the DIMAYOR, unrecognised by FIFA because of a dispute between the league and the domestic governing body. Restrictions in England limited the <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> (£12 in the season and £10 during the summer) and impeded a player's ability to transfer to another club, which caused much discontent in British football until the system was reformed in the 1960s. Liddell chose to reject the contract offer, reportedly estimated at £12,000. His wife Phyllis, whom he married in 1946, later attributed the decision to club loyalty and the recent birth of twins. He later recalled that the proposal had been tempting, acknowledging that the decision {{would have been more}} challenging {{had it not been for}} the births. Many footballers did agree to contracts, including Alfredo Di Stefano, Neil Franklin, Charlie Mitten, and Hector Rial.|$|E
5|$|As a pupil at Dunfermline High School, Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and {{two other}} languages. He became a {{reluctant}} rugby player, {{under the guidance of}} retired Welsh international Ronnie Boon, while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys. By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, Hamilton Academical, and Partick Thistle. Liverpool manager George Kay became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish defender Matt Busby, who learned of the teenager from Manchester City's Alex Herd while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take Willie McAndrew, manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon. Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938 and became a professional in 1939 on a <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> of £3. Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant at a company in the club's city.|$|E

25|$|The {{strength}} {{of support for}} rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (T'owd Tin Pot) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams {{found it difficult to}} play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a <b>weekly</b> <b>wage</b> could easily lead to financial hardship.|$|E
30|$|The {{saturated}} OLS model (column 4, F[*]=[*] 240.1) explained 60.7  % of {{the variance}} with diversity having a statistically significant effect. The corresponding FE models (columns 5 – 7) all indicated no relationship between cultural diversity and <b>weekly</b> <b>wages.</b> This indicates that controlling for individual differences eliminated {{the positive effects of}} diversity. The result corroborates previous OLS and FE results obtained using UK data (Longhi 2013). Although contemporaneous diversity appears to have strong effect on <b>weekly</b> <b>wages,</b> it is not robust to the estimator type when the dependent variable is lagged. In an alternative analysis where contemporaneous diversity is categorised (results not shown), the authors found diversity to be statistically significant in the OLS but not in the FE estimation. This contradicts the expectation that higher levels of diversity yield negative labour market outcomes due to communication issues and polarisation that can possibly arise in the workplace (Zhan et al. 2015).|$|R

Second, the effect of diversity, {{as measured by the}} degree of concentration of foreign nationals at the LGA level, on wages varies depending on the model specification.
