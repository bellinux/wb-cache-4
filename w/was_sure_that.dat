5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of the march. The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> she would be fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she {{was familiar with the}} topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E

5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

25|$|The German Depression-Help Trust (Stiftung Deutsche Depressionshilfe) {{warned of}} stigmatizing mentally ill people in {{reaction}} to the shooting. Ulrich Hegerl, chairman of the Trust and director of Leipzig University Psychiatry, said the school <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> depression was not the cause for the perpetrator's actions, as such a diagnosis would not have necessarily played a role.|$|E
25|$|The inventions of Hieronymus were {{championed by}} Astounding Science Fiction editor John W. Campbell in late 1950s and early 1960s editorials. A series of correspondences {{between the two}} men show that while Hieronymus <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> someday his {{theories}} of eloptic energy would be proven and accepted by physical scientists, Campbell was convinced that the machines were based on psionics, related to the user's paranormal or ESP powers.|$|E

25|$|During Petipa's {{sojourn in}} Paris for the staging of Le Marché des Innocents, he {{acquired}} a scenario from the dramatist Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges for a ballet titled La Fille du Pharaon (The Pharaoh's Daughter), inspired by Théophile Gautier's Le Roman de la Momie. Throughout the Victorian era Europe was fascinated with all things concerning {{the art and}} culture of ancient Egypt, and Petipa <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> a ballet on such a subject {{would be a great}} success.|$|E
25|$|E. Marryatt {{proposed}} William John Dyer, seconded {{pro forma}} by H. Clark. Before {{he announced his}} nomination, John Lillie Gillies signalled {{that he was about}} to propose someone who was well known among those who lived in the electorate. After a speech, Gillies announced his nomination and stated that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the electors could not find a more honest candidate than Arthur John Burns, who he then announced as the candidate he would like to propose. James Smith seconded that nomination.|$|E
25|$|It was {{generally}} {{thought that the}} next Pope would be the candidate chosen by Cardinal Borghese, {{because he was the}} most influential person in the Sacred College. He wanted to elect his friend Cardinal Campori, and already before opening the conclave he had obtained twenty four declarations in his favor. Although Campori had two significant opponents (Republic of Venice and Cardinal Orsini), Borghese <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be able to}} achieve his election on the first day of voting, by acclamation.|$|E

25|$|Paul Mantz, Hollywood's leading stunt pilot, {{was paid}} the then-unprecedented sum of $4,500 to crash-land a B-17 bomber for one early {{scene in the}} film. Frank Tallman, Mantz' partner in Tallmantz Aviation, wrote in his {{autobiography}} that, while many B-17s had been landed by one pilot, {{as far as he}} knew this flight {{was the first time that}} a B-17 ever took off with only one pilot and no other crew; nobody <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> it could be done.“ The footage was used again in the 1962 film The War Lover.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the {{parliamentary}} elections of November 2, 2003, in which the New Rights overcame the 7-percent threshold, were abolished. New general elections were called. There was very little time left before the March 28, 2004 elections. The revolutionary sentiments were gaining momentum. Therefore, everyone {{inside and outside of}} the country <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> none of the opposition parties would be able to succeed. From the so-called non-revolutionary parties, only the New Rights were able to overcome the 7-percent barrier. They made a coalition with another party of centre-right orientation, the Industrials and consequently successfully overcame the 7-percent threshold. David Gamkrelidze {{was in charge of the}} Industrial’s and New Right’s election campaign on March 28, 2004 as well.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the new {{propeller}} steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying {{a load of}} wheat. At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E

25|$|The men's race saw Lukas Verzbicas {{fulfill his}} promise to Kevin McDowell and win his first world title. Verzbicas had {{decided to return to}} triathlon for one more season to win the world title for McDowell. McDowell was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in March and Verzbicas <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he would have won the world title in 2011. The American defeated European Champion Justus Nieschlag and another American, Tony Smoragiewicz in to second and third. Olympic Champion Aaron Barclay and bronze medallist Alois Knabl were first out of the swim in a group of eight as two groups formed on the bike. Verzbicas {{and the rest of the}} chase pack caught the leaders on the first climb of the bike. On the run, Verzbicaks pulled away to seal an emotional world title.|$|E
25|$|The three brigades {{gathered}} by Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth from the Austrian Hereditary Provinces neared the Vág and Garam rivers, receiving a brigade from {{the division of}} Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich and the Jablonowski division defeated at Vác some days earlier. Welden <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> this Austrian army corps, now containing around 20 000 men, would stop the Hungarian advancement. But the contradictory orders given by Welden and Jelačić, prevented that this corps to arrive on time {{in the vicinity of}} the Garam river. Welden on 17 April gave him order to march towards Vác, and enter in contact with Wohlgemuth, but the Croatian ban was not very willingly to obey, agreeing to move only on 20 April (a day after the battle of Nagysalló actually took place).|$|E
25|$|Barks {{started taking}} various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, {{stubborn}} and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At {{the same time}} he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: Walt Disney's Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck.|$|E
