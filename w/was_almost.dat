40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} almost Armendariz ring which is the generalization of Armendariz ring and discuss some of its properties. We prove that a ring R <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> Armendariz {{if and only if}} n X n upper triangular matrix ring T_{n}(R) <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> Armendariz ring. Similarly, If R <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> Armendariz if and only if R[x] <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> Armendariz. It <b>is</b> observed that every <b>almost</b> Armendariz ring <b>is</b> weak Armendariz but converse need not be true. But, if R is semicommutative ring, then weak Armendariz ring <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> Armendariz ring. Moreover, the class of minimal noncommutative <b>almost</b> Armendariz rings <b>is</b> completely determined, up to isomorphism (minimal means having smallest cardinality) ...|$|R

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Massachusetts—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The {{total cost of the}} ship <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates and guns caused a delay. Her keel was laid down on 25 June 1891 and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert and commander George Dewey. Her preliminary sea trial did not take place until March 1896 because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries. At this point Massachusetts <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> complete, and her official trial was held a month later.|$|E

We give a negative answer in this paper, and the counterexample relies on an explicit construction of a scalar almost periodic function whose derivative <b>is</b> not <b>almost</b> periodic. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the derivative DxF to <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> periodic...|$|R
