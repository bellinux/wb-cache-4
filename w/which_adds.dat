5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area.

The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, <b>which</b> <b>adds</b> another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E
