50|$|<b>Wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> {{can also}} be used in fine art {{printing}} applications to transfer a color photocopy image or color laser print to a high-rag-content art paper, such as a hot-press watercolor paper. The transfer method involves coating the source image with the <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> then placing it face-down on the target paper and pressing the pieces of paper together under pressure using a standard etching press.|$|E

40|$|Plant {{essential}} oils from eight plant species were tested for their insecticidal activities against the red imported fire ant,  Solenopsis invcita, {{by using a}} fumigation bioassay. This study reveals that the mortalities after treatment of the workers of red imported fire ants varied according to the classification of workers, oil type, dosage, and exposure time. Among the {{essential oils}} tested, strong insecticidal activity was observed with the essential oils of camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), artemisia annua (Artemisia annua), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), mugwort (Artemisia argyi), and wintergreen (Ilex chinensis). Ant mortalities from chrysanthemum oil (Dendranthema indicum), turpentine oil (Pinus massoniana), and forsythia oil (Forsythia suspense) treatments were significantly lower than those from the previously mentioned five essential oil treatments. This study showed that camphor, artemisia annua, eucalyptus, mugwort, and <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oils</b> may have potential {{to be used as}} substitutes for chemical insecticides. </span...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wintergreen</b> {{essential}} <b>oil</b> {{is usually}} obtained by steam distillation {{of the leaves}} of the plant following maceration in warm water. Methyl salicylate is not present in the plant until formed by enzymatic action from a glycoside within the leaves as they are macerated in warm water. [...] <b>Oil</b> of <b>wintergreen</b> is also manufactured from some species of birch, but these deciduous trees are not called wintergreens. Spiraea plants also contain methyl salicylate in large amounts and are used similarly to wintergreen. Wintergreen has a strong [...] "minty" [...] odor and flavor; however, the Gaultheria-genus plants are not true mints, which belong to the genus Mentha.|$|R
50|$|Odorizers {{are used}} in carbon dioxide fire {{extinguisher}} systems, the odorizer assembly injects <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> into the carbon dioxide stream when the agent is discharged. Approximately 50 cc of <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a protective housing attached to the discharge piping {{in such a manner}} as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge, atomizing the oil and dispersing it. The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard.|$|E
50|$|Methyl {{salicylate}} (oil of wintergreen or <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil)</b> is {{an organic}} ester naturally produced by {{many species of}} plants, particularly wintergreens. It is also synthetically produced, used as a fragrance, in foods and beverages, and in liniments.|$|E
50|$|Also, when sugar {{crystals}} are crushed, tiny electrical {{fields are}} created, separating {{positive and negative}} charges that then create sparks while trying to reunite. Wint-O-Green Life Savers work especially well for creating such sparks, because <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> (methyl salicylate) is fluorescent and converts ultraviolet light into blue light.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> is an {{ingredient}} in some popular vegetable-oil based lubricants used in firearm maintenance. These products, sold under the names Seal1 and Frog Lube, are proprietary blends of vegetable oils intended to clean, lubricate {{and preserve the}} metal surfaces of firearms. They have the advantage over petroleum-based products of being non-toxic and biodegradable.|$|E
5000|$|The twigs, when scraped, have {{a slight}} scent of <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil,</b> though not as {{strongly}} so as the related sweet birch {{which is the only}} other birch in North America to also smell of wintergreen. However, the potency of the odor is not considered a reliable identification method unless it is combined with other characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|The Gaultheria species {{share the}} common {{characteristic}} of producing oil of wintergreen. <b>Wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> is a pale yellow or pinkish fluid liquid that is strongly aromatic with a sweet, woody odor (components: methyl salicylate (about 98%), α-pinene, myrcene, delta-3-carene, limonene, 3,7-guaiadiene, and delta-cadinene) that gives such plants a distinctive [...] "medicinal" [...] smell whenever bruised. Salicylate sensitivity {{is a common}} adverse reaction to the methyl salicylate in oil of wintergreen; it can produce allergy-like symptoms or asthma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> is used topically (diluted) or aromatherapeutically as a folk {{remedy for}} muscle and joint discomfort, arthritis, cellulite, obesity, edema, poor circulation, headache, heart disease, hypertension, rheumatism, tendinitis, cramps, inflammation, eczema, hair care, psoriasis, gout, ulcers, and broken or bruised bones. The liquid {{salicylate}} dissolves into tissue and also into capillaries, so overuse is as risky as overuse of aspirin. Wintergreen also {{is used in}} some perfumery applications and as a flavoring agent for toothpaste, chewing gum, soft drinks, confectionery, Listerine, and mint flavorings. One application is rust removal and degreasing of machinery. Wintergreen is particularly effective for breaking through sea water corrosion.|$|E
40|$|Apart from {{isolated}} {{reports of}} severe salicylate poisoning after ingesting {{an unusually large}} amount of a medicinal oil, there are no published data on the threat arising from attempted suicide with topical medicaments containing methyl salicylate or <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> compared with aspirin tablets. In this retrospective study, the admission plasma salicylate concentrations and clinical presentations were compared in 80 subjects who had taken aspirin tablets (n = 42) or topical medicaments (n = 38). The proportions of subjects being symptomatic were similar in the two groups. Although the admission plasma salicylate concentrations were generally higher in subjects who had ingested aspirin tablets, the two highest readings (4. 3 and 3. 5 mmol/ 1) belonged {{to two of the}} subjects who had taken topical medicaments. Because of its liquid, concentrated form and lipid solubility, methyl salicylate poses the threat of severe, rapid-onset salicylate poisoning. The toxic potential of topical medicaments containing methyl salicylate or <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> should be fully appreciated by both physicians and the general public...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{essential}} oils have been advocated {{for use in}} complementary medicine for bacterial and fungal infections. However few of the many claims of therapeutic efficacy have been validated adequately by either in vitro testing or in vivo clinical trials. The objective {{of the study was}} to study the antifungal activity of nine commercially available {{essential oils}} against Candida albicans in vitro and to compare the antifungal activity between each material. Methodology: Nine pure essential oils; <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil,</b> lime oil, cinnamon oil, spearmint oil, peppermint oil, lemongrass oil, cedarwood oil, clove oil and eucalyptus oil were selected for the study. Candida albicans was inoculated at 37 ˚C and seeded on Sabourauds dextrose agar medium. Sterilized filter paper saturated with the oils were placed on the seeded agar plates and inoculated for 48 hours. Zone of inhibition were measured around the filter paper in millimeters with vernier caliper. Results: Cinnamon oil showed highest activity against Candida albicans followed by Lemongrass oil and cedarwood oil. <b>Wintergreen</b> <b>oil,</b> lime oil, peppermint oil and spearmint oil showed no antifungal activity. Conclusion: The use of these essential oils against Candida can be a viable alternative to other antifungal agents as these are an effective module used in the control of both bacteria and yeasts responsible for oral infections.

40|$|Various flow {{visualization}} {{techniques were}} used to define the secondary flows near the endwall in a large heat transfer data. A comparison of the visualized flow patterns and the measured Stanton number distribution was made for cases where the inlet Reynolds number and exit Mach number were matched. Flows were visualized by using neutrally buoyant helium-filled soap bubbles, by using smoke from oil soaked cigars, and by a few techniques using permanent marker pen ink dots and synthetic <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil.</b> Details of the horseshoe vortex and secondary flows can be directly compared with heat transfer distribution. Near the cascade entrance there is an obvious correlation between {{the two sets of}} data, but well into the passage the effect of secondary flow is not as obvious...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSix {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. The natural compounds capsaicin and menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive TRPV 1 and cold-sensitive TRPM 8, respectively. The burning and cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. We show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon oil, <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil,</b> clove oil, mustard oil, and ginger all activate TRPA 1 (ANKTM 1). Bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its G protein-coupled receptor, also activates TRPA 1. We further show that phospholipase C is an important signaling component for TRPA 1 activation. Cinnamaldehyde, the most specific TRPA 1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that TRPA 1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived as burning pain...|$|E
40|$|Microencapsulation of {{geraniol}} and <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> by the maize protein, zein, was investigated. The {{efficiency of}} encapsulation, the morphology of micro-particles and the controlled-release kinetics of the geraniol-zein system were studied. The main findings were the following: ? Geraniol-to-zein mass ratios lower than unity showed very low particle yields. At ratios higher than unity an abrupt increase in particle yield was observed. It reached values {{as high as}} 85 %. Concurrently high geraniol mass fractions up to 78 % were realised. This unusual behaviour is proposed to be attributed either to the inversion of the zein globular structure driven {{by an increase in}} the hydrophobicity of the surrounding medium or to the increased phase separation kinetics of the geraniol. ? Insignificant particle yields for the wintergreen oil-zein system may be attributed to the high polarity of methyl salicylate. ? Geraniol and wintergreen oil-containing micro-particles had a spherical geometry prior to lyophilisation. Scanning electron and confocal microscopy revealed that the geraniol-zein micro-particles can be classified as reservoir systems. Release kinetics approaching zero-order release, consistent with a glassy reservoir system, were observed. ? Kinetic modelling predicts that 80 % of encapsulated geraniol can be released over a period of 17 days at 20 ?C. ? The results mean that the geraniol-zein microcapsule system holds promise and that {{it should be possible to}} produce it for large-scale, sustainable agricultural use as an aphid repellent. It is recommended that the release kinetics of the geraniol-zein system be studied in an aqueous environment and that other polar biopolymers be investigated.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effects of a {{spearmint}} (/-carvone) and <b>wintergreen</b> <b>oil</b> (methyl salicylate) emulsion (CMSE) on age 1 landlocked Atlantic salmon Salmo salar sebago (hereafter salmon). Salmon were immersed in either 257 µl/L CMSE or 75 mg/L tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222) to induce anesthesia (stage 4), useful for emersion and noninvasive husbandry procedures, and then salmon were recovered in fresh water. Induction was quicker in the CMSE group; however, recovery was quicker in the MS- 222 group. A second experiment was conducted in which salmon were immersed in 257 µl/L CMSE for 8. 5 min, or 75 mg/L MS- 222 for 8. 5 min in order to compare electrocardiographs during deeper anesthesia (stage 5) between salmon continuously immersed in CMSE to those continuously immersed in MS- 222. Because salmon remained sedated longer after CMSE exposure than after MS- 222 exposure, a third group of salmon was immersed in 257 µl/L CMSE for just 2. 5 min before undergoing the 6 -min electrocardiograph procedure. Anesthesia induction rates, recovery rates, and electrocardiographs of salmon anesthetized with CMSE were comparable to salmon anesthetized with MS- 222. Salmon anesthetized with CMSE and then transferred immediately to fresh water had more stable heart rates than salmon anesthetized with either MS- 222 or CMSE continuously. Salmon bathed continuously in CMSE showed clinical signs of increasing anesthetic depth including decreasing heart rate, decreasing respiration rate and electrocardiograph abnormalities. The CMSE, with its mint and wintergreen concentrations less than in household products such as chewing gum, toothpaste, and mouthwash, is a potent, rapid-acting immersion fish anesthetic comparable to MS- 222 for stages 4 and 5 anesthesia...|$|E
