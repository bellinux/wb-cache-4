500|$|Four {{days before}} the race, the September 11 attacks took place, causing most major American {{sporting}} events scheduled on the same weekend as the German 500 to be postponed, including National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) games, and a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race, the New Hampshire 300, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The Italian Grand Prix, a Formula One race, was held that weekend. According to Ronald Richards, {{the vice president of}} CART, the series decided to continue with the race prior to the cancellation of that week's NFL games, a decision followed by other American leagues. Richards acknowledged that [...] "We wish <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the input regarding the NFL's decision prior to making our decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Malick and Toll {{shot for}} 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 {{days in the}} Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the {{historic}} battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, [...] "It's still a bit difficult to get {{on and off the}} island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense". The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.|$|E
500|$|Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was {{to start}} in mid-2007, before Singer halted {{development}} in favor of Valkyrie. Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped {{out in favor of}} directing Jack the Giant Slayer. In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Because of its {{previous}} {{contributions to the}} series—Halo 2s Blastacular and Halo: Reachs Defiant map pack—Certain Affinity was approached by 343 Industries to streamline the multiplayer maps to take Halo: Reachs gameplay options into account. The multiplayer is powered by the Halo: Reach engine. 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said {{that the decision to}} use Reach for the multiplayer was controversial, even within the studio. [...] "In Halos day, there was never a proper networking mode," [...] O'Connor explained. [...] "We couldn't roll back the technology; [...] just wouldn't have worked with things like latency and all other modern Xbox Live-related problems. So <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to build it from scratch, and it still wouldn't have been the experience [...] remember." [...] An additional consideration O'Connor mentioned was that producing a full replication of Combat Evolveds multiplayer would have divided the Halo player base and interrupted Reachs lifespan. In choosing which seven Halo maps to remake, 343 Industries set a number of rules—the map could not have been previously remade for a 360-era Halo title, it had to work with Reachs gameplay sandbox, and {{it had to be a}} fan favorite. The company retained the same art director between the campaign and multiplayer elements of Anniversary to make sure the two halves of the game looked visually cohesive.|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, Warner Bros. {{suggested}} a reboot {{of the film}} series. Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011, explaining [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film {{in the way that}} we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all." [...] Paul Levitz stated in an interview that Batman holds the key to the Superman reboot. He elaborated, [...] "Everyone is waiting for Nolan to sign on for another Batman, once that happens, the release date for Superman and all other future projects will follow." [...] In February 2009, McG, who previously planned to direct Superman: Flyby, expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise. August 2009 saw a court ruling in which Jerry Siegel's family recaptured 50% of the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's share of the copyright in Action Comics#1. In addition, a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films. However, if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Siegel estate {{would have been able to}} sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{commissioned}} {{husband and}} wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film in February 2007, halting development for the Superman Returns sequel. The Justice League script was submitted to Warner Bros. the following June, which prompted the studio to immediately fast track production. Singer went on to film Valkyrie the following month, and George Miller signed to direct Justice League: Mortal in September 2007. The script would have featured a different Superman in a separate continuity from Singer's film; Routh was not approached to reprise his role for Justice League: Mortal, which ended up going to D. J. Cotrona. The film nearly went into production in March 2008, but the Australian Film Commission denied Warner Bros. their 40 percent tax rebate and Catrona's options eventually expired. With Justice League: Mortal canceled, Singer renewed {{his interest in the}} Superman sequel that same month, stating that it was in early development. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, still expected Routh to reprise the title role, but Routh's contract for a sequel expired in 2009. [...] "Superman Returns didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to," [...] Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov admitted in August 2008.

500|$|Music writers offered various {{interpretations of}} the video's style and concept. David Peisner of Spin wrote of the close-ups {{featured}} in the music video, [...] "As the camera sucks him in, it feels intimate and intrusive, revealing and voyeuristic". Music critic Jim Farber commented that D'Angelo's torso [...] "sways in grinding rhythm, tensing and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction", while claiming that the video has [...] "nothing but close-ups of D'Angelo's buff body on the apparent receiving {{end of one of}} life's great payoffs". In his essay [...] "'Untitled': D'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body" [...] for his 1999 Wide Angle journal, journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". In his review of D'Angelo's Voodoo, Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R and hip hop at the time, stating [...] "One could call the video for 'Untitled (How Does it Feel)' narcissistic, but in an era when most R videos are nothing but 'bling, bling' and booty, D'Angelo's bare naked torso was refreshing". On the video's camera range and angle, Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, had stated [...] "It stopped just north of the line where, you know, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> issues". A 2008 press release for D'Angelo described the music video as [...] "featuring D'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond {{joined the}} Bomb Squad, newly formed in January 1971 due to concern over The Angry Brigade. Bond became the unit's first {{commander}} on 23 June 1971, being promoted to that position in 1969. The unit served at Tintagel House, and Bond's name was theoretically {{meant to be}} kept secret {{and he should be}} called 'Commander X', so that he was not bombed, but journalists have since claimed to have known his name within days of his appointment. The press lauded Commander X as a [...] "mystery supremo to hunt down the Angry Brigade." [...] The Angry Brigade was a new political group; [...] "a small group [...] of leftwing radicals and anarchists," [...] who claimed responsibility for about 20 small bombings which began on 20 November 1970, with the bombing of a BBC van. At its formation, the Bomb Squad comprised around 30 men, one third from CID, the rest from Special Branch. The Angry Brigade's decline came in 1971, when various conspirators were arrested. At the 1971–72 trial, the nine conspirators were denied bail at Clerkenwell Court after Bond opposed the move, and the judge, J Purcell, [...] "remanded all nine in custody for a week." [...] There were concerns that the police had [...] "over-reached themselves." [...] The Angry Brigade member John Barker later said that [...] "the police framed a guilty man," [...] and Bond was called an [...] "old-fashioned plod" [...] by a defendant. He told the Purcell that [...] "I am quite certain that, sooner or later, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> somebody killed." [...] Due to his success, in 1972 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Operations).|$|E
500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere she went {{in the days after}} the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} year, vocalist and guitarist Arie {{as well as}} bassist Remy quit the band. According to Bart this {{decision}} was influenced by several factors; [...] "I had wanted to bring in someone into the band for vocals {{all the way back}} in 2001, this was not possible at the time as some ex-members of the band felt that it would diminish their importance or feel threatened." [...] He added, [...] "...you see, back in 2002, we weren't expecting all this to happen a month before recording - and to have to write {{the other half of the}} album in 4 weeks... if there had been no changes at all, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to deal with similar issues anyway. That's because, little did we know at the time, the other guitarist had only one song ready a month before studio (despite telling us he had material for four songs) so either way <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> four weeks to write the rest of the album. Maybe he chose to deal with it by leaving the band, I don't know and I don't really care." ...|$|E

Crusader was [...] "won by a hair’s breadth" [...] by the newly designated Eighth Army, but [...] "had we lost it, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to fight the battle of Alamein six {{months or a year}} earlier, without the decisive weapon of the Sherman tank".|$|E

[...] In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: Lemuria and Sirius B. The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and a 32-member choir.

2500|$|Let me {{make one}} other point clear {{for the benefit of}} the {{millions}} in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a vastly greater shortage than we face today.

[...] Mullen said, [...] "If we had {{two or three more}} months to work, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a very different record.

2500|$|Gaines's Mill was {{an intense}} battle, {{the largest of}} the Seven Days and the only {{clear-cut}} Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured). Since the Confederate assault was conducted against {{only a small portion of}} the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. Lee's victory, his first of the war, could have been more complete if it were not for the mishaps of Stonewall Jackson. Historian Stephen W. Sears speculates that it were not for Jackson's misdirected march and his poor staff work, the major assault that Lee unleashed at 7 p.m. could have occurred three or four hours earlier. This would have put Porter in grave jeopardy, without any last-minute reinforcements and the cover of darkness. He quotes Edward Porter Alexander, prominent Confederate artillery officer and postwar historian: [...] "Had Jackson attacked when he first arrived, or during A.P. Hill's attack, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an easy victorycomparatively, & would have captured most of Porter's command." ...|$|E

Subsequent legislatures, I hope, will {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide early last year, without outside interference, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every way that I can, but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide."
