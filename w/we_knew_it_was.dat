500|$|Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, {{a former}} {{resident}} of New York, had conceived {{the idea of}} having the family travel to the city to locate their missing car and believed it to be [...] "a classic Manhattan problem". Bill Oakley, who had visited the World Trade Center when the construction of the towers was completed in 1973, suggested parking the car in the plaza of the buildings. Josh Weinstein observed that, [...] "When we realized that there was a plaza between the two towers, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a perfect spot to have Homer's car." ...|$|E
500|$|Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures {{experienced}} financial difficulties. Spielberg {{estimated the}} film would cost $2.7million {{to make in}} his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4million. Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to cost that much, we wouldn't have greenlighted it because we didn't have the money." [...] Spielberg hired Joe Alves, his collaborator on Jaws, as production designer. In addition the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A {{large portion of the}} sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike. Columbia raised $7 million from three sources: Time Inc., EMI, and German tax shelters.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be a}} completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

[...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to kill people right and left.

500|$|Fincher {{wanted the}} {{vignette}} to be a [...] "personal nightmare" [...] for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. [...] "Early on, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to feel}} like a nightmare," [...] Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, {{standing in the middle of}} a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the [...] "gooey" [...] element that was so desired. [...] "David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette," [...] Miller recalled. [...] "It ties everything together other than the black on black." ...|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone <b>we</b> <b>knew...</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{descendant}} of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, Cornwell {{was born on}} June 9, 1956 in Miami, Florida, second of three children, to Marilyn (née Zenner) and Sam Daniels. Her father {{was one of the}} leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the last time we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad 'How's work?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 2006, the Dixie Chicks {{released}} the single [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{in advance of}} their upcoming album. [...] Written by the Dixie Chicks and songwriter Dan Wilson, it directly addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the previous three years. Robison said, [...] "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And once we had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." [...] She said writing the song had become their [...] "therapy", since they had to hold in so many stored emotions for so long. Thus, the band considered the album not so much political as very personal.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E

We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that was a really good feeling.
