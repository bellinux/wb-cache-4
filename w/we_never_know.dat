25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, NBC ran {{a two-part}} fictionalized mini-series titled [...] which starred Amy Irving and won her a Golden Globe nomination. In {{the words of}} Hal Erickson, [...] "Irving plays the leading {{character}} in a lady-or-the-tiger fashion, so that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> if she truly swallows her own tale or if she's merely a clever charlatan." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> a {{healthier}} set {{of boys and}} girls. They were so full of energy and dash.|$|R
6000|$|... "And only to think," [...] cried Dorothy, [...] "that Button-Bright {{has been}} {{carrying}} you {{in his pocket}} all this time, and <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> it!" ...|$|R
60|$|How long Jim and I {{sat there}} <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew.</b> The second tragedy, not so pitiful but as heart sickening as the first, crushed our spirits.|$|R
2500|$|Thompson had {{concerns}} about federal judges deciding social {{policy in this}} area: [...] "Many federal judges seem intent on eliminating God from the public schools and the public square {{in ways that would}} astound our founding fathers. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when a five to four Supreme Court decision will uphold them. They ignore the fact that the founders were protecting the church from the state and not the other way around." ...|$|E
60|$|PRESS. We don't know. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> {{whether we}} {{come before the}} event, or it comes before us.|$|E
60|$|YOUNG OFF. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> {{unless it}} happens to be hand to hand; I haven't come in for that yet.|$|E
6000|$|We rebuked him {{severely}} {{for this}} remark and said <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> an ignorant person yet but was prejudiced. The Frenchman spoke again, {{and the doctor}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leslie!" [...] cried Anne in amazement. [...] "Where {{have you}} sprung from? <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> you were coming. Why didn't you write? We would have met you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paying taxes with naught to {{pay them}} with is {{what the rest of}} France has been doing these many years, but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> the {{bitterness}} of that before. We shall know it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ah!' {{he would}} cry bitterly to himself, 'it {{is the old}} story, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> {{the value of a}} thing until we have lost it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{then this}} is not my natural manner?' she rejoined. 'Now you must really bear with me, because I ask for information. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" [...] murmured Mrs. Cliff, [...] "he {{never comes}} to any point. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> {{anything}} clear and distinct. This {{is not any}} answer at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't talk of that, dearest. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> {{how little}} <b>we</b> could live on till we tried; and if No. 12 is taken, {{and you are}} paid for the new edition of the lectures, and Walter's pay besides--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How are you, {{good old}} Barka?' {{they said to}} the negro; 'and how comes it that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>we</b> had a sister till now?' and they greeted Udea warmly, while she shed tears of relief and gladness.|$|R
60|$|Whether or not my {{accident}} {{had produced}} this result <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew,</b> {{but at least}} one thing was certain--the secret was out and Whiteman would not enter upon a search for the cement mine this time. We were filled with chagrin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fish {{and make}} berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've bin a week aboard. It's all new to you, but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what {{may come to}} us. Now, take me--Tom Platt--I'd never ha' thought--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't there a proverb," [...] said Pauline, who at {{the time}} was busy making cordage while Otto was {{breaking}} sticks for the fire, [...] "which says that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> our mercies till we lose them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O child, {{the human}} heart can suffer! It can hold more tears than the ocean holds waters. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how deep, how wide it is, till misery begins to unbind her clouds, and fill it with rushing blackness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I speak; as I find, Mr Sweedlepipes,' said Mrs Gamp. 'Forbid {{it should}} be otherways! But <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> wot's hidden in each other's hearts; and if we had glass winders there, we'd need keep the shetters up, some on us, I do assure you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed," [...] Rupert answered. [...] "The letter which, we doubted not, {{that you}} wrote to my grandfather, never came to hand, and <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> what Monsieur Dessin's real name was, so that Colonel Holliday did not know to whom to write in France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is going'--he {{repeated}} feebly and then, quite {{suddenly he}} {{fell back on}} the pillows and his soul passed. And <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> which way it was going.

6000|$|... "Your Royal Highness {{is always}} very kind," [...] said Rosina, which was true; {{but how much}} better and wiser {{it is not to}} begin to deceive! <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how far we may be carried, and so Jaqueline found out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are a {{handsome}} body of men,' said the miller in a disinterested voice. 'Faith! I didn't {{know they were}} coming, {{though it may be}} in the newspaper all the time. But old Derriman keeps it so long that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> things till they be in everybody's mouth.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> 'ow much we' like {{anything}} till we lose it. A week arterwards, as Ginger was being 'elped {{out of a}} pawnshop by Peter, he said 'e would give all he 'adn't got for the locket to be near enough to Sam to hear 'im laugh agin.|$|E
60|$|No doubt Emily {{went through}} a great deal, but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> exactly <b>knew</b> what.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{what these}} [...] "bad berries" [...] were I cannot tell. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> their real name. They were small, red-clustered berries of a glossy, seductive appearance, {{and we were}} {{forbidden}} to eat them, because it was thought they might be poisonous. Dan picked a cluster and held it up.|$|R
60|$|How {{long did}} it last? <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew.</b> It may have been ten minutes or two hours, for in such a scene time loses its proportion. Only we became aware that the wind had fallen, while the noise of {{grinding}} snow and hurtling boulders ceased. Very cautiously we gained our feet and looked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} do {{anything}} to this house till he comes back," [...] said Mrs. Phipps. [...] "I expect {{he would like to}} have a voice in it. He always used to admire it and say how comfortable it was. Well, well, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what is before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis all over, Jasper," [...] said he,--"'tis all over. Ah's me! Poor Sergeant Dunham has {{finished}} his march, and that, too, {{by the hand}} of a venomous Mingo. Well, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what is to happen, and his luck may be yourn or mine to-morrow or next day!" ...|$|E
60|$|This story {{should teach}} us {{the folly of}} condemning others for actions {{that we do not}} understand, for <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what may happen to ourselves. It may also serve as a hint to be careful about leaving parcels in public places, and, incidentally, to let other people's {{packages}} severely alone.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Clark began hosting Offbeat America for HGTV, {{where he}} could be seen {{traveling}} the country in search of places we've never been and things <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> existed. The highly rated show aired Sunday evenings at 6 PM (ET/PT). Patrick interviewed the people behind these extraordinary American treasures, revealing their passions and inspirations.|$|R

5000|$|Norrie also {{shares the}} belief that John's {{travelling}} to the future returns {{to the beginning of}} the franchise, signalling [...] "John's role in the beginning of the resistance. Terminator 3 aside, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> how exactly John Connor came to lead the resistance". Norrie concludes that the development [...] "aligns perfectly and makes sense in more ways than one." ...|$|R
