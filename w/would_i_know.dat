2500|$|There is {{evidence}} [...] that Marais' time {{and research in}} the Waterberg brought him great peace and joy and provided him with artistic inspiration. In the poem Waar Tebes in die stil woestyn, he writes (as translated into English by J. W. Marchant) 'There <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> peace once more, where Tebes in the quiet desert lifts it mighty rockwork on high ...'. (Tebus {{is one of the}} principal peaks of the area). That said, Marais was a long-term morphine addict and suffered from melancholy, insomnia, depression and feelings of isolation.|$|E
2500|$|Xun You {{was known}} for being a highly {{profound}} and insightful thinker {{who was able to}} hide secrets very well. Since he started accompanying Cao Cao on his military campaigns, he has often helped Cao devise and develop strategic plans. Many people, including his family members and relatives, hardly knew what was on his mind or what he had said. The Wei Shu recorded that Xin Tao (辛韜), a maternal cousin of Xun You, once asked Xun You on why he urged Cao Cao to attack Ji Province. Xun You replied, [...] "Since Zuozhi has come on behalf of Yuan Tan to surrender, it's expected that the Imperial Army will go there to pacify the area. How <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> why?" [...] Xin Tao and others did not dare to ask Xun You again about state and military affairs after that.|$|E

I sometimes think, my brother, that you would do better to give me even more of your confidence. You are a very clever man, but you do keep yourself so secret. If I too were not clever, how <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> to send you this news, how <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that it will make you glad? But there, you will go your way. I know it! ...|$|E

6000|$|Mill. But how {{to hinder}} it, I cannot {{possibly}} tell; {{for my father}} presses me to it, and will take no denial: <b>Would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> some way! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not expect}} you <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you too well; but I {{want to hear what}} you have been doing--what he said,' {{answered}} Charles, in short, impatient sentences.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would it {{be quite}} regular, dear?" [...] she asked. [...] "For if it <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{of no other}} place in which I should rather be married to my forest god than beneath the shade of his primeval forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But is it {{impossible}} to do this?" [...] Gervaise asked eagerly. [...] "My father has money, and <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> be ready, if I could communicate with him, to pay a handsome sum, if sure that it would result in my obtaining my freedom." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Beshrew me, Flibbertigibbet," [...] replied Wayland, [...] "but {{thou art}} sharper than a Sheffield whittle! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> by what charm you muzzled yonder old bear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{the most}} fitting and beseeming mode to do so," [...] said Heriot, [...] "were it but to {{instruct}} our poor countrymen in better fashions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laugh on," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "laugh on, my masters," [...] shrugging his shoulders; [...] "it is {{not for me to}} be offended--yet <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> full fain {{from that}} squire who is {{laughing}} with the loudest, how he had discovered this unhappy blot in an otherwise spotless lineage, and for what purpose he hath made it known?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the man. I shouldn't think you'd {{have much}} trouble with Skinner in the future. By the way, I've got {{you for a}} fag this term. You don't have to do much in the summer. Just rot around, you know, {{and go to the}} shop for {{biscuits}} and things, that's all. And, within limits of course, you get the run of the study.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In my grandfather's time," [...] he said, [...] "two hundred Armstrongs, {{and their}} followers, could gather {{in case of}} need; but the family was grievously thinned, {{in the days when}} Edward carried fire and sword through Scotland; and for the last fifty years Roxburgh and these parts have been mostly under English rule, and in that time we have never {{gathered}} as a family. Still, all my kin <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> take up this quarrel; and I should say that, in twelve hours, we could gather fifty or sixty stout fighting men.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must then}} {{be some of}} these flaunting {{silkworm}} sirs about the court," [...] said the armourer, his natural heat of temper kindling from disappointment and vexation--"some of those who think they carry it off through the height of their plumed bonnets and the jingle of their spurs. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> which it was that, leaving his natural mates, the painted and perfumed dames of the court, comes to take his prey among the simple maidens of the burgher craft. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> but his name and surname!" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{have a real}} {{hatred for}} those dreary fools and knaves who would have me suppose that Henley, that {{crippled}} Titan, may conceivably be tapping at the underside of a mahogany table or scratching stifled incoherence into a locked slate! Henley tapping!--for the professional purposes of Sludge! If he found himself among the circumstances of a spiritualist seance he <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> instantly smash the table with that big fist of his. And as the splinters flew, surely York Powell, out of the dead past from which he shines on me, would laugh that hearty laugh of his back into the world again.|$|E
60|$|Any {{suggestion}} of yours, even were it conveyed {{in the less}} tender shape of {{the text of the}} 'Baviad', or a Monk Mason note in Massinger, [1] would have been obeyed; I should have endeavoured to improve myself by your censure: judge then if I shall be less willing to profit by your kindness. It is not for me to bandy compliments with my elders and my betters: I receive your approbation with gratitude, and will not return my brass for your Gold by expressing more fully those sentiments of admiration, which, however sincere, <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> be unwelcome.|$|E
6000|$|... "ISN'T she?" [...] They both faced about, {{and stood}} looking at the mare, and the light, shining, open buggy behind her. The {{sunshine}} had the after-storm glister; the air was brisk, and the breeze blew balm {{from the heart of}} the pine forest. [...] "Miss Breen," [...] he broke out, [...] "I wish you'd take a little dash through the woods with me. I've got a broad-track buggy, that's just right for these roads. I don't suppose it's the thing at all to ask you, on such short acquaintance, but I wish you <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you'd enjoy it: Come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came because}} {{he asked me}} to read to him your letters, and I found they comforted him so much that your {{presence}} <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> comfort him more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a mystery}} in this,--a mystery that I cannot fathom," [...] he said. [...] "And now <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what {{measures}} it would be proper to take." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So please you, my Lord," [...] said Osmond, {{stopping}} short, [...] "we go not rashly {{into the}} midst of them. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what were best to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|And as for you, Doctor Reynolds, {{and your}} sociates, {{how much are}} you [...] bound to his Majestie's clemencye, {{permitting}} you contrary to the [...] statute 'primo Elizabethae', so freely to speak against the liturgie [...] and discipline established. Faine <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the end you aime at, [...] and whether you be not of Mr. Cartwright's minde, who affirmed, that [...] we ought in ceremonies rather to conforme to the Turks than to the [...] Papists.

6000|$|DEAR FRIEND,--I do {{not know}} your name, but I think these [...] few lines will reach you, which I wrote {{to thank you for}} [...] your {{kindness}} to me the night I left Weatherbury in a [...] reckless way. I also return the money I owe you, which you [...] will excuse my not keeping as a gift. All has ended well, [...] and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young [...] man who has courted me for some time--Sergeant Troy, of [...] the 11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this town. He [...] <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> object to my having received anything except [...] as a loan, being a man of great respectability and high [...] honour--indeed, a nobleman by blood.|$|E
60|$|It is my duty to-night {{to speak}} about the study of Biology, and while it may be that there are many of my {{audience}} who are quite familiar with that study, yet as a lecturer of some standing, it <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> by experience, be very bad policy on my part to suppose such to be extensively the case. On the contrary, I must imagine that there are many of you who {{would like to know what}} Biology is; that there are others who have that amount of information, but would nevertheless gladly hear why it should be worth their while to study Biology; and yet others, again, to whom these two points are clear, but who desire to learn how they had best study it, and, finally, when they had best study it.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not look}} at her, but I could feel her standing, {{watching}} me. If I had looked up, she <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> have held out her arms to me....|$|R

6000|$|... "It is lucky, indeed," [...] {{the girl}} said to herself, when he had finished, [...] "that I found {{that my father had}} left Nombre de Dios, and had come down to his house here; for, assuredly, the people would have made short work of these poor lads, had I not been here to aid them. But, after all, what can I do? My father <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> do {{anything}} for my sake; and I have told him how this lad jumped overboard, to save my life; but there is one here greater than he, that terrible Inquisition. These boys are heretics, and it will be impossible to conceal, for any time, from the priests that they are here. Still, at any rate, for a time we might hide them; and in gratitude only, I would do all in my power for them." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{about seven}} o'clock Charley {{came in from}} his trip to Ramsgate, and very hearty and cordial was he in the {{pleasure}} he felt at my happiness. Mrs. Mapleside took a great fancy to him, and their three days' stay was altogether a delightful time. On Monday morning they returned to town, as Charley could not stay away longer from his business. Polly and he tried hard to persuade me now {{to give up my}} plan of a residence at Canterbury, and to go and live with them; but this I would not do. I am very comfortable and happy where I am, and Mrs. Mapleside looks upon me quite as her own child, and <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> miss me dreadfully; and as at farthest I thought Percy would be back in two years, I made up my mind to remain as I was till then, but I promised to pass a good deal of my time with Polly.|$|E
6000|$|The {{manner to}} be adopted for Magny's retreat was {{proposed}} by myself, and was arranged so as to consult the feelings of delicacy of both parties.

I know the Duke's gracious wish is, that my attentions should be received favourably; but, as time has not appeared to alter your attachment elsewhere, and as I have too much spirit to force a lady of your name and rank to be united to me against your will, the best plan is, that I should make you, for form's sake, a proposal UNauthorised by his Highness: that you should reply, as I am sorry to think your heart dictates to you, in the negative: on which I also will formally withdraw from my pursuit of you, stating that, after a refusal, nothing, not even the Duke's desire, should induce me to persist in my suit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{what the}} Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it," [...] replied Isaac;--"nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby." ...|$|R
