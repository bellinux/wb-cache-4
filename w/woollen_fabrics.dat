6000|$|There {{is neither}} tree nor shrub in this country; {{and a very}} little wheat (which seldom ripens), barley, turnips, and {{radishes}} are, I believe, the only crops, except occasionally peas. Other legumes, cabbages, etc., are cultivated in the sheltered valleys of the Yaru feeders, where great heat is reflected from the rocks; and there also stunted trees grow, as willows, walnuts, poplars, and perhaps ashes; all of which, however, {{are said to be}} planted and scarce. Even at Teshoo Loombo and Jigatzi* [Digarchi, Jigatzi, or Shigatzi jong (the fort of Shigatzi) is the capital of the [...] "Tsang" [...] province, and Teshoo Loombo is the neighbouring city of temples and monasteries, the ecclesiastical capital of Tibet, and the abode of the grand (Teshoo) Lama, or ever-living Boodh. Whether we estimate this man by the number of his devotees, or the perfect sincerity of their worship, he is without exception one of the most honoured beings living in the world. I have assumed the elevation of Jigatzi to be 13-14,000 feet, using as data Turner's October mean temperature of Teshoo Loombo, and the decrement for elevation of 400 feet to 1 degree Fahr.; which my own observations indicate as an approximation to the truth. Humboldt ("Asie Centrale," [...] iii., p. 223) uses a much smaller multiplier, and infers the elevation of Teshoo Loombo to be between 9,500 and 10,000 feet. Our data are far too imperfect to warrant any satisfactory conclusions on this interesting subject; but the accounts I have received of the vegetation of the Yaru valley at Jigatzi seem to indicate an elevation of at least 13,000 feet for the bed of that river. Of the elevation of Lhassa itself we have no idea: if MM.

After the Normans built Monmouth Castle, the town of Monmouth gradually developed as a market town, a river port, and as a centre for the manufacture of iron goods and <b>woollen</b> <b>fabric.</b> By the twelfth century, development had taken place beyond the Monnow Bridge at Overmonnow, forming a suburb or faubourg. The mediaeval iron industry at Overmonnow resulted in the wastage of large piles of cinders; these [...] "cinder hills", which gave their name to Cinderhill Street, were removed in the eighteenth century.

50|$|In the {{finishing}} process of manufacturing textiles, after the cloth is woven, {{it goes through}} processes such as washing, fulling, raising the nap and trimming the nap. After the nap is trimmed, the fabric is considered finished. The raising process, which draws out {{the ends of the}} fibres, is done on both woollen and cotton fabric. Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process. There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. <b>Woollen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which must be damp when raising the nap, are then dried and stretched before the nap is trimmed or sheared. Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process, where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the raised fibres are the same length.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the <b>woollen</b> <b>fabrics</b> of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of Pashm or Pashmina, which is the wool of Capra hircus, a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls {{came to be called}} Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best fleece wool is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft fleece wool from which were made the famous and much coveted 'ring shawls' in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir.|$|E

On-farm, there is documented evidence that including handle assessment in a selection index provides additional improvements in genetic gain. However, the assessment of greasy wool handle is based on a tactile evaluation of the wool staple by sheep and wool classers, and its application is affected by a lack of framework that instructs assessors on a standard method of assessment. Once a reliable and repeatable protocol is developed, further understanding of the effect greasy wool handle has on final garment quality will be possible...|$|E
40|$|Classification of wasted woollen {{textiles}} {{on the basis}} of their colour is a basic approach for the supply of a raw material which does not involve the cost of the colouring process. Colour classification is a very difficult task, especially when a fabric is composed by differently coloured fibre (melange fabric). Many systems have been developed in the last years for colour classification of textiles. Unfortunately such colour classification systems are not able to correctly classify melange fabrics. In the present work a method for real-time classification of melange colour <b>woollen</b> <b>fabrics</b> is proposed. The provided approach, that is suitable also for classifying solid colour fabrics, integrates a Machine Vision (MV) system, able to acquire high resolution images, with a clustering algorithm capable of mapping the colour pixel of fabric images into a series of colour classes. The proposed system provides a colour classification with a misclassification less than 10 % when compared with the classification resulting from a panel of expert human operators.
