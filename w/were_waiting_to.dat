5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in {{the third}} match of the event by LAX against Team 3D. HÃ©ctor Guerrero and Salinas {{accompanied}} LAX to the ring. Salinas, Guerrero, and Team 3D's associate Johnny Devine all interfered in the encounter. Near the end when Team 3D <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> perform their signature 3D tag team maneuver on Hernandez, Homicide came up behind Devon and pinned him with a schoolboy pin at 15 minutes to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez's {{squadron}} {{remained at}} {{large in the}} Atlantic until July 1806, when a hurricane scattered the vessels along the American Seaboard where British patrols <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> intercept them. Of the 11 ships that set out in December 1805, just four eventually returned to France. The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success, {{with the exception of}} Duckworth, who shared in the general thanks but was otherwise unrewarded. By leaving his post off Cadiz he had provoked the anger of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in the Mediterranean; only his victory enabled Duckworth to escape a court martial.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as they}} {{received}} the news, Rana Bahadur and his group proceeded towards Kathmandu. Some troops were sent by Kathmandu Durbar to check their progress, but the troops changed their allegiance when they {{came face to face}} with the ex-King. Damodar Pande and his men were arrested at Thankot where they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> greet the ex-King with state honors and take him into isolation. After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he started to extract vengeance on those who had tried to keep him in exile. He exiled Rajrajeshhwori to Helambu, where she became a Buddhist nun, on the charge of siding with Damodar Pande and colluding with the British. Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, were executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Rana Bahadur also punished those who did not help him while in exile. Among them was Prithvipal Sen, the king of Palpa, who was tricked into imprisonment, while his kingdom forcefully annexed. Subarnaprabha and her supporters were released and given a general pardon. Those who had helped Rana Bahadur to return to Kathmandu were lavished with rank, land, and wealth. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second kaji; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen's brother, was made the mul kaji; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur's half-brother, was made the mul chautariya; while Rangnath Paudel was made the raj guru (royal spiritual preceptor).|$|E

The Polish King Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture Sultan Murad II. The subsequent retreat foreshadowed Christendom's general retreat before the advancing Ottomans.

25|$|In 1968, Pearson was {{succeeded by}} Pierre Trudeau, who also {{advocated}} patriation. He made several attempts, including the Victoria Charter in 1971 and more proposed amendments in 1978. At the 1978-79 conference, Trudeau {{prepared for the}} first time to provide some federal concessions with regard to the division of powers, including family law, fisheries, and resources. However, the other premiers balked, which led to speculation they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see if the more province-friendly Progressive Conservatives would win the coming federal election. In that campaign, the Liberals ran on constitutional change, including a speech at Maple Leaf Gardens in which Trudeau promised unilateral action if the premiers did not agree to patriation.|$|E
25|$|To {{carry out}} this operation, the Nazi {{authorities}} dispatched two specialists in the field, Alois Brunner and Dieter Wisliceny, who arrived on February 6, 1943. They immediately applied the Nuremberg laws in all their rigor, imposing the display of the yellow badge and drastically restricting the Jews' freedom of movement. Toward the end of February 1943, they were rounded up in three ghettos (Kalamaria, Singrou and Vardar / Agia Paraskevi) and then transferred to a transit camp, called the Baron Hirsch ghetto or camp, which was adjacent to a train station. There, the death trains <b>were</b> <b>waiting.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish their mission, the SS relied on a Jewish police created for the occasion, led by Vital Hasson, which {{was the source of}} numerous abuses against the rest of the Jews.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the dream. For most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, {{rather than the other way}} around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return. Although the surveys were useful in the planning of later lines, the three were never built.|$|E

25|$|The two SRBs were {{designated}} as flight set 122 by contractor Alliant Techsystems and were made up from one new segment and remaining segments reused across 54 earlier shuttle missions {{dating back to}} STS-1. Inside the VAB, engineers attached a large sling to Discovery and the orbiter was rotated vertical. The orbiter was lifted into the high bay where its external tank (ET-137) and boosters <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be mated. During the mating operations, an internal nut pre-positioned inside the aft compartment of the orbiter slipped out of position and fell away inside the compartment. Engineers initially were worried that the orbiter {{would have to be}} removed from the ET and placed back in a horizontal orientation to make repairs. However, later they successfully accessed the area inside the aft compartment, and re-positioned the nut to complete the repairs. The bolting of the orbiter to its ET ('hard mate') was completed early in the morning of 11 September 2010 at 09:27 EDT.|$|E
25|$|In July 1762, barely {{six months}} after {{becoming}} emperor, Peter took a holiday with his Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, leaving his wife in Saint Petersburg. On the night of 8 July (OS: 27 June 1762), Catherine the Great was given the news {{that one of her}} co-conspirators had been arrested by her estranged husband, and that all they had been planning must take place at once. She left the palace and departed for the Ismailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech asking the soldiers to protect her from her husband. Catherine then left with the regiment to go to the Semenovsky Barracks, where the clergy <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> ordain her as the sole occupant of the Russian throne. She had her husband arrested, and forced him to sign a document of abdication, leaving no one to dispute her accession to the throne. On 17 July 1762âeight days after the coup and just {{six months after}} his accession to the throneâPeter III died at Ropsha, at the hands of Alexei Orlov (younger brother to Grigory Orlov, then a court favourite and a participant in the coup). Historians find no evidence for Catherine's complicity in the supposed assassination.|$|E
25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see how it progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time}} in a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E

25|$|It {{was as a}} {{performer}} on The Frost Report that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic class sketch, contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, middle class Ronnie Barker and the even shorter, working class Ronnie Corbett. This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on At Last the 1948 Show, during which time the Four Yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch). Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of Doctor in the House (and later Cleese wrote six episodes of Doctor at Large on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapman's alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with {{just the two of}} them. He had found working with Palin on The Frost Report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, {{on the back of the}} success of Do Not Adjust Your Set, been offered a series for Thames Television, which they <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> begin when Cleese's offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.|$|E

[...] Horowitz went on to criticize this issue as a problem Sega would have again with the Sega 32X in 1994, stating, [...] "History would repeat itself in the harshest of manners only five years later. Sega's expectations of third party support for something it showed little enthusiasm for were entirely unrealistic and ultimately meant that no games would be in the pipeline." ...|$|E
