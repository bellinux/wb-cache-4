Now, because these terminating Rays, and all the intermediate ones which come from any part of the luminous body, are suppos'd by some sufficient refraction before they enter the eye, to have their pulses made oblique to their progression, and consequently each Ray to have potentially superinduc'd two proprieties, or colours, viz., a Red on the one side, and a Blue on the other, which notwithstanding are never actually manifest, but when this or that Ray has the one or the other side of it bordering on a dark or unmov'd medium, therefore as soon as these Rays are entred into the eye and so have one side of each of them bordering on a dark part of the humours of the eye, they will each of them actually exhibit some colour; therefore ADC the production of GACH will exhibit a Blue, because the side CD is adjacent to the dark medium CQDC, but nothing of a Red, because its side AD is adjacent to the enlightned medium ADFA: And all the Rays that from the points of the luminous body are collected on the parts of the Retina between D and F shall have their Blue so much the more diluted by how much the farther these points of collection are distant from D towards F; and the Ray AFC the production of KCAI, will exhibit a Red, because the side AF is adjacent to the dark or quiet medium of the eye APFA, but nothing of a Blue, because its side CF is adjacent to the enlightned medium CFDC, and all the Rays from the intermediate parts of the luminous body that are collected between F and D shall have their Red so much the more diluted, by how much the farther they are distant from F towards D.|$|E

50|$|Comprising {{about ten}} to fifteen per cent of the total {{population}} in Egypt, Coptic Orthodox Christians (usually referred to as Copts) rely on the many services of the Orthodox Church and its dogma. Because the Copts compromise {{a small percentage of the}} population, most live in remote areas around Egypt mostly in the Zabbaleen, a poverty stricken area located in the Mokattam Village, Assuit, Akhmim, Girgeh, Luxor, Kuft and Nagada. As part of their core belief, Copts practice and accept the “Seven Sacrament,” which are explained as channels in which believers receive the sanctifications of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word “Sacrament” translates to “mystery” and Copts use this term specifically because of the unexplainable absolution that may derive from it. The Seven Sacraments are affirmed and derived by contemporary Orthodox Catechisms and textbooks. Although there are more than seven official Sacraments of the church, the Orthodox Confessions in the 17th century, endorsed by local councils against the Reformation such as Metrophanes Critopoulos in 1625, Peter Mogila in 1638 and Dostheos of Jerusalem in 1672, determined that there were seven important Sacraments to a spiritual life and the Orthodox Church accepted this. The Seven Sacraments are in order of: baptism, confirmation, repentance and confession, communion, matrimony, anointing of the sick, and priesthood. Here, we <b>will</b> <b>further</b> <b>examine</b> the sixth Sacrament, ‘anointing of the sick’, but first we must briefly contextualize Orthodoxy in Egypt to understand the hierarchy of the Church among Egyptians in Egypt and worldwide.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the hapten 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) mediates cell death is unclear according to current literature. To determine how DNP mediates death in the B 16 F 10 murine melanoma cell line in vitro, cells were modified with 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene (DNFB). Following modification, cell lysates were collected and analyzed via Western blottings with known apoptotic or necrotic markers.

30|$|Blue OLED with triple {{emissive layer}} {{structure}} achieved luminous efficiency of 5.23  cd/A at 3.5  V, which is 36 % {{higher than that}} of the conventional blue OLEDs. Obviously, the quantum well-like structure is favorable for hole-electron recombination for efficient exciton generation in the multiple emissive layers of DPVBi, ADN, and DPASN with BAlq in the device. There was no significant improvement in the luminous efficiency (only about 3 % and 4 %) when DPVBi and ADN were used as the additional emitting layer to form a quantum well-like structure; a 36 % improvement in luminous efficiency was realized in DPASN/BAlg/DPASN blue OLEDs. This result shows that blue OLEDs can only improve luminous efficiency under proper difference in HOMO and LUMO energy level between the central and surrounding emitting layers. The effect of layer thickness and combination of different emissive layers on charge carrier transport mechanism from the quantum well-like and the blue emitting layer based on space charge limited current <b>will</b> be <b>further</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As an {{increasing}} number of robots have been designed to interact with people on a regular basis, research into human-robot interaction has become more widespread. At the same time, little work has been done on the problem of long-term human-robot interaction, in which a human uses a robot for a period of weeks or months. As the person spends more and more time interacting with the robot, it is expected that the means by which they make sense of the robot and its behavior- their “cognitive model ” of the robot- may change over time. In order to examine this cognitive model, a study was conducted involving the Personal Exploration Rover (PER) museum exhibit and the museum employees responsible for them. The results of the study suggest a number of relevant components of a cognitive model for human-robot interaction which <b>will</b> be <b>further</b> <b>examined</b> in an upcoming study on scientist-rover interaction.

However, the performance of correlation analysis can be significantly improved either by providing additional biological information or by combining correlation with other techniques that can extract various mathematical or statistical properties of gene expression from microarray data. In this article, I will test the performance of three correlation methods-the Pearson correlation, the rank (Spearman) correlation, and the Mutual Information approach-in detection of protein-protein interactions, and I <b>will</b> <b>further</b> <b>examine</b> the properties of these techniques when they are used together.

40|$|In {{numerous}} {{biochemical processes}} {{there is a}} need for artificial peptidases that efficiently cleave peptide bonds in proteins. However, due to the extreme stability of the peptide bond this reaction is very difficult to achieve. In the development of new artificial peptidases, metal-substituted polyoxometalates are presented in this project. From earlier research it became clear that polyoxometalates are able to interact with proteins in a specific way and this interaction may lead to a certain type of selectivity in the artificial peptidase. In this project several polyoxometalates will be functionalised with organic complexes that coordinate hydrolytically active metal ions. Once synthesised, their hydrolytic activity will be investigated on a number of smaller peptides as well as on proteins by using NMR-spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. The peptide fragments <b>will</b> be <b>further</b> <b>examined</b> to understand the mechanism and selectivity of the hydrolysis reaction.

Even though this rule was shown to be quite accuate for most cases, it could sometimes give unsafe results for certain short length geometries.

In this work, the design rule <b>will</b> be <b>further</b> <b>examined</b> by performing numerical simulations, taking into account these effects of plasiticity, as well as imperfections and geometric nonlinearity.
