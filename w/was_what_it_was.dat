For instance, in the book The Basement: Meditations on a Human Sacrifice (1979), {{completed}} over four years, she chronicled the torture and murder of Indianapolis teenager Sylvia Likens by Gertrude Baniszewski in 1965 that had preoccupied her for 14 years. With a feminist perspective, she explored {{the story of the}} defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, [...] "Quite apart from any feminist polemics, The Basement can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission." [...] Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: [...] "It {{is the story of the}} suppression of women. Gertrude seems to have wanted to administer some terrible truthful justice to this girl: that this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be a woman".|$|E
500|$|Before the Clash's founding, the band's future {{members were}} active in {{different}} parts of the London music scene. John Graham Mellor sang and played rhythm guitar in the pub rock act the 101'ers, which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, [...] "Woody" [...] Mellor, in favour of [...] "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a busker in the London Underground. Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS, which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS was managed by Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the Sex Pistols. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members. Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were Paul Simonon, who tried out as a vocalist, and drummer Terry Chimes. Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week, then quit. After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones's manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: [...] "You knew straight away that was it, and this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous." [...] At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising. Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, Keith Levene on guitar and [...] "whoever we could find really to play the drums" [...] were rehearsing. Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.|$|E

Though {{thought to be the}} much better fighter, Coleman was caught by a heel hook from Takada and submitted. The {{validity}} of this fight has been questioned by many fans. In response to questions about the fight's legitimacy, Coleman said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I needed to support my family.

That I'm sure of. ... <b>It</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and I imagine <b>it</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> so good; putting it as modestly as I can, <b>it</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> if I'd been born in England, and <b>it</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> if I'd stayed in America.

That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact." [...] Other critics labeled Web 2.0 [...] "a second bubble" [...] (referring to the Dot-com bubble of 1997–2000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of business models. For example, The Economist has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as [...] "Bubble 2.0".|$|E
2500|$|Bee Vang, as paraphrased by Jeff Baenen of the Associated Press, {{said that}} the film's {{portrayal}} of the Hmong is [...] "generally accurate." [...] Regarding the result, Vang said [...] "his film is not a documentary. We can't expect 101 percent correctness." [...] During the filming, Hmong cast members addressed what they believed to be cultural inaccuracies that were being introduced. Cedric Lee, a half-Hmong {{who worked as a}} production assistant and a cultural consultant, said that [...] "Some things were over-exaggerated for dramatic purposes. Whether it was our job or not, I still felt some responsibility to speak our mind and say something, but at the same time, the script <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> We didn’t make the final decision." [...] Vang said while many Hmong had objected to some elements, the producers selected the viewpoints of the cultural consultants which [...] "had the most amenable take on the matter and would lend credence to whatever Hollywood stereotypes the film wanted to convey." [...] Vang further said that [...] "this was a white production, that our presence as actors did not amount to control of our images." ...|$|E

60|$|Duane {{could not}} put her from him.

This <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be loved by a woman. His years of outlawry had blotted out any boyish love he might have known. This was {{what he had to}} give up--all this wonder of her sweet person, this strange fire he feared yet loved, this mate his deep and tortured soul recognized. Never until that moment had he divined the meaning of a woman to a man. That meaning was physical inasmuch that he learned what beauty was, what marvel in the touch of quickening flesh; and it was spiritual in that he saw there might have been for him, under happier circumstances, a life of noble deeds lived for such a woman.|$|E
60|$|It {{has already}} been said that Mary Lowther was tall,--taller than common. Her back was as lovely a form of womanhood as man's eye ever {{measured}} and appreciated. Her movements, which were never naturally quick, had a grace about them which touched men and women alike. It was the very poetry of motion; but its chief beauty consisted in this, that it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> by no effort of her own. We have all seen those efforts, {{and it may be}} that many of us have liked them when they have been made on our own behalf. But no man as yet could ever have felt himself to be so far flattered by Miss Lowther. Her dress was very plain; as it became her that it should be, for she was living on the kindness of an aunt who was herself not a rich woman. But it may be doubted whether dress could have added much to her charms.|$|E

The way he took that old lady's wrinkled hand, and bowed over it, and thanked her, was an ode to manhood. Everyone was touched. Those who had been about to titter wondered what on earth Mr. James had seen to titter at, and Grizel almost clapped her hands with joy; she {{would have done it}} altogether had not Tommy just then made the mistake of looking at her for approval. She fell back, and, intoxicated with himself, he thought it was because her heart was too full for utterance.

6000|$|If a man {{frequently}} passes unjust judgments, {{takes up}} false attitudes, intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and {{falls into the}} consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the less ugly because they are ascribed to [...] "temper." [...] Especially I object to the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a breakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day {{as long as he}} lives. Yesterday <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> my rib is paining me, it is not a main object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in his lifelong gentleness.

6000|$|As he sat thus thinking, and the {{daylight}} increased, he discerned, {{a short distance}} before him, a movement of something ghostly. His position was facing the window, and he found that by chance the looking-glass had swung itself vertical, so that what he saw was his own shape. The recognition startled him. The person he appeared was too grievously far, chronologically, {{in advance of the}} person he felt himself to be. Pierston did not care to regard the figure confronting him so mockingly. Its voice seemed to say 'There's tragedy hanging on to this!' But the question of age being pertinent he could not give the spectre up, and ultimately got out of bed under the weird fascination of the reflection. Whether he had overwalked himself lately, or what he had done, he knew not; but never had he seemed so aged by a score of years as he was represented in the glass in that cold grey morning light. While his soul <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> why should he have been encumbered with that withering carcase, without the ability to shift it off for another, as his ideal Beloved had so frequently done? ...|$|E

Do you think I regret my life? Do you think I would rather be a fat burgess, like a calf? Not I! I have had moments when I have been applauded on the boards: I think nothing of that; but I have known in my own mind sometimes, when I had not a clap from the whole house, that I had found a true intonation, or an exact and speaking gesture; and then, messieurs, I have known what pleasure <b>was,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to do a thing well, what it was to be an artist.
