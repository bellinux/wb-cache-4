The data of this qualitative research were collected through interviewing and observing life of 24 Cambodian child migrant workers in the Rong Kluea Market area. The field data were classified into categories, interpreted, decoded, synthesized and tested using triangulation. The results of the study revealed that there were three factors that made the Cambodian child workers in the Rong Kluea Market area migrate: 1) internal factors from the country of origin which were poverty and economic status of their family, family conditions, household debts, and a lack of education; 2) migration of the foreign child workers was migration from their place of origin in rural areas of Cambodia to new areas in Poipet...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Sociology. "December 2006. "The gender {{wage gap}} still exists, with women earning about 73 % of what men earn. One factor {{that has been}} {{recently}} looked at as contributing to this earnings gap is household labor. Women are still completing the majority of household labor despite cultural trends otherwise. Traditionally, {{there have been three}} schools of thought in income determination. The Individual model argues that individuals make investments in human capital through education and experience which increases their productivity, and therefore their attractiveness to potential employers. Employers pay higher premiums for more valuable employees. The Structural model argues that there is a hierarchy of positions in the economic structure, each with a preset range of income. An individual's position in the hierarchy determines their income. Researchers from a Gender model of income determination argue that discrimination, harassment, and the unequal treatment of women <b>workers</b> <b>force</b> women into lower paying jobs. This study combines the three models of income determination into the alternative model of income determination, with household labor as a component of the Gender model. The 2004 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) was used to test hypotheses of income determination. The full alternative model explained 56 % of the variance in income (adjusted R squared. 562). Multiple regression results showed that household labor was not {{a major factor in the}} variation between men and women’s income, going against the bulk of the previous literature. Implications for findings were discussed...|$|E

The occupations of Cambodian child migrant workers in the Rong Kluea Market area were found to consist of 10 main categories: 1) holding umbrellas to provide shade for tourists, 2) collecting garbage items for sale, 3) taking people across the border through a shortcut, 4) cleaning frogs, 5) cutting off grasshoppers’ wings, 6) scraping fish flesh and scaling fishes, 7) pushing goods carts, 8) peddling goods and fruit, 9) shop as workers sistants, and 10) selling sex services.
