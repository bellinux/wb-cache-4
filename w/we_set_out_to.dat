You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do. Created the world that <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

[...] Unusually for a BBC {{television}} drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film.

According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and everything comes down around your ears, if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything.

Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|To {{follow-up}} It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} pursued a different direction, content-wise. According to Chuck D, {{they sought to}} make a more thematically focused work and to condense Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's theory of [...] "Color Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy)" [...] into an album-length recording, [...] "telling people, well, color's an issue created and concocted {{to take advantage of}} people of various characteristics with the benefit of a few". He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with Billboard, [...] "We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance". Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would {{stand the test of time}} by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E
500|$|To promote Modern Life Is Rubbish, Food {{released}} [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] as the album's lead {{single in}} the UK in April 1993. The single, which showcased Blur's new sound and attitude, performed moderately well in the charts, reaching number 28. A few weeks later in May 1993, Modern Life was released. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo that featured the phrase [...] "British Image 1" [...] spraypainted behind Blur members (who were dressed {{in a mixture of}} mod and skinhead attire) and a Mastiff. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quiet concerns, Blur subsequently released the [...] "British Image 2" [...] photo, which was [...] "a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party". The album peaked at number 15 on the UK Album Chart. In the next few months Food further issued two UK Top 30-charting singles—"Chemical World" [...] and [...] "Sunday Sunday"—to support the record; however, Modern Life only managed to sell around 40,000 copies at the time. Nonetheless, the mood within the Blur camp was positive, as the band felt they had accomplished something; bassist Alex James told writer David Cavanagh in 2000, [...] "Modern Life Is Rubbish was a successful record because it achieved what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> achieve.
