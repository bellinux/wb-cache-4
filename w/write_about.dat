5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying}} to capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{biologists}} still often <b>write</b> <b>about</b> {{evolution as}} if organisms had goals, and some philosophers of biology such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language is unavoidable in evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|The Echo's new-look website was {{launched}} in February 2007, while a digital editing suite was created within the office at the same time. The audio-visual equipment allows reporters to both <b>write</b> <b>about</b> and film stories as they happen, and the articles can be published on-line within seconds.|$|E

5|$|After {{military}} {{service in the}} United States Air Force, {{he graduated from the}} University of Illinois with an undergraduate degree. Two years later, he had a master's degree from the University of Chicago. In 1959 he finished his doctoral degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He retired from Purdue University, was appointed Professor Emeritus, and lived in Canberra, Australia, where he continued to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|After the book's publication, Szalavitz {{continued}} to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> {{the controversy surrounding}} the troubled-teen industry for Statistical Assessment Service, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reason, and The American Prospect. The House Committee on Education and Labor held additional hearings on the matter on April 24, 2008, again chaired by Representative George Miller.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E
40|$|Pauli <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> Delbrück's {{reaction}} to Bohr's letter on biology and physics. He {{is against the}} orthodox belief that classical genetics and chance selection alone can explain biological evolution. Pauli <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> an illustration by J Neumann describing the attitude of orthodox biologists. He <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> Oppenheimer's View...|$|R
40|$|Pauli replies to Weisskopf's {{letter of}} the 22 nd December 1957. He <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> his {{scientific}} correspondence with Heisenberg, and his own suggestion for a extension of the Lee-model.

40|$|Pauli <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> the {{probability}} interpretation of wave-mechanical quantities. He comments on Fermi statistics for degenerate gases. He asks for clarification on Wentzel's method for {{the solution of}} Schrödinger's equation. He <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> an application of quantum mechanics to X-ray absorption. He <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> a meeting of physicists in Hamburg...|$|R
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} <b>write</b> <b>about</b> social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had {{made it impossible to}} win, and continued to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} San Luis Potosí, Blancornelas {{began his career}} as a {{journalist}} for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955, working as a sportswriter. In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief. Unlike several other journalists during his time, Blancornelas was eager to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> drug trafficking and corruption, leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{continued}} to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> both missionary {{work and the}} Sundanese language. In 1881, he wrote a series of condemnatory reviews of Sundanese-language schoolbooks offered by the colonial government, arguing that the content had little value and the language was mostly artificial. He published a Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1884, consulting various works of Sundanese literature for his lexemes. In 1901, he published {{a history of the}} mission in the East Indies, titled De zendingseeuw voor Nederlandsche Oost-Indiës (The Century of the Mission in the Dutch East Indies). It described the 19th century as time of extensive growth.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
50|$|Race was {{a common}} issue as well, {{as seen in the}} work of Pauline Hopkins, an African-American woman who {{published}} five influential works from 1900 to 1903 discussing racial and sexual inequalities. Similarly, Sui Sin Far <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> Chinese-American experiences, Maria Cristina Mena <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> Mexican-American experiences, and Zitkala-Sa <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> Native American experiences.|$|R
50|$|He has <b>written</b> <b>about</b> {{the history}} and {{philosophy}} of art <b>writing,</b> raising questions <b>about</b> the relativism of art writing in different eras by comparing texts <b>written</b> <b>about</b> the same artwork and analyzing changing styles of interpretation.|$|R
40|$|Pauli {{comments}} on the meson theory with integer spin and strong coupling. He <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> Schwinger's approach to the problem.

5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> smallpox, the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced. Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and <b>write</b> <b>about</b> his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and <b>write</b> <b>about</b> a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E
5000|$|He was a noted {{historian}} of the Pacific Northwest, particularly Puget Sound. Some of his most noteworthy works are Skid Road, the [...] "longest-running Pacific Northwest book in print" [...] which was <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Seattle in 1946 and Puget's Sound <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Tacoma. Among other topics, he <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> the Alaska Gold Rush, the Columbia River, the Aleutian Islands.|$|R

5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E

50|$|The Śulbasūtras are {{appendices}} to the Vedas {{which give}} rules for constructing altars. They {{are the only}} sources of knowledge of Indian mathematics from the Vedic period. There are several Śulbasūtras. The {{most important of these}} are the Baudhayana Śulbasūtra <b>written</b> <b>about</b> 800 BCE, the Apastamba Śulbasūtra <b>written</b> <b>about</b> 600 BCE, Manava Śulbasūtra <b>written</b> <b>about</b> 750 BCE and the Katyayana Śulbasūtra <b>written</b> <b>about</b> 200 BCE. Since Katyayana has been identified with one Vararuci, possibly the author of the Vartikas, Katyayana Śulbasūtra is referred to as Vararuci Śulbasūtra also.|$|R
