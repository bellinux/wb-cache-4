5|$|Monroe's troubled {{private life}} {{received}} much attention. She struggled <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, {{both of which}} ended in divorce. On August 5, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates {{at her home in}} Los Angeles. Although Monroe's death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death.|$|E

Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Winehouse's battles <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse {{were the}} subject of much media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 {{reported}} a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E

Pathological (disordered) gambling has commonalities in clinical expression, etiology, comorbidity, physiology and treatment <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders (DSM-5).

Similar patterns of comorbidity and risk factors in individuals <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> induced disorder and those with independent non-substance induced psychiatric symptoms suggest that the two conditions may share underlying etiologic factors.|$|E

40|$|Objective Structural neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} lower regional gray matter volume in adolescents <b>with</b> severe <b>substance</b> and conduct problems. These research studies, includ-ing ours, have generally focused on male-only or mixed-sex samples of adolescents <b>with</b> conduct and/or <b>substance</b> problems. Here we compare gray matter volume between female adolescents <b>with</b> severe <b>substance</b> and conduct problems and female healthy controls of similar ages. Hypotheses: Female adolescents <b>with</b> severe <b>substance</b> and conduct prob-lems will show significantly less gray matter volume in frontal regions critical to inhibition (i. e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex), conflict processing (i. e., anterior cingulate), valuation of expected outcomes (i. e., medial orbitofrontal cortex) and the dopamine reward system (i. e. striatum).

25|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is known to be}} highly comorbid with conduct disorder (a theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies. This may be explained in part by deficits in executive function. Anxiety disorders often co-occur with ASPD, and contrary to assumptions, psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety; this appears to be related to items from Factor 2 but not Factor 1 of the PCL-R. Psychopathy is also associated <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders.|$|E
25|$|Low {{conscientiousness}} {{has been}} linked to antisocial and criminal behaviors, as well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness taken together are also associated <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse. People low in conscientiousness have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High conscientiousness is associated with more careful planning of shopping trips and less impulse buying of unneeded items. Conscientiousness {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with business white collar crime.|$|E

He reached his darkest moment <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse while touring in London for The Fragile, when he mistakenly purchased china white heroin, which he believed to be cocaine; he consequently overdosed and was resuscitated at a local hospital.|$|E

25|$|Housing First has {{met with}} success since its initial {{implementations}} in 2009 by providing relatively no strings-attached housing to homeless people <b>with</b> <b>substance</b> abuse problems or mental health issues. Housing First allows homeless {{men and women to}} be taken directly off the street into private community-based apartments, without requiring treatment first. This allows the homeless to return to some sense of normalcy, from which it is believed that they are better-poised to tackle their addictions or sicknesses. The relapse rate through these types of programs is lower than that of conventional homeless programs.|$|E
