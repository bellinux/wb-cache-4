25|$|After {{high school}} White became a {{bookkeeper}} {{at the firm}} where his father worked. He was a diligent worker, but his job gave him little opportunity to pursue his artistic interests. He wrote that he reported to work at 7 am {{six days a week}} and left at 6 in the evening, sometimes working on Sundays <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> really busy. His maternal uncle Ira Billman, who was a published poet, encouraged White to continue developing his creative skills, and by 1890 White was producing sketchbooks filled with pencil sketches, pen-and-ink drawings and watercolors.|$|E
25|$|It took Alexander {{three days}} to get {{everything}} ready for the general assault {{that was about to}} take place against the city. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> finally ready, Alexander divided his force into three parts. The first part of the force he ordered to attack the palisades that were around the city itself. The second part formed a line of battle and faced the Theban infantry. The third part was a reserve, tasked with plugging up any holes and to press up any advantages that the Macedonians gained {{in the course of the}} siege.|$|E

500|$|Tierney {{continued}} his political activism in the 1990s and early 2000s by donating to {{local and national}} campaigns and headed George W. Bush's outreach to Catholics in the 2000 Presidential Election. Tierney was credited with helping generate votes for Bush and helping him win important states like Ohio and Missouri. Tierney also frequently appeared as a conservative voice on WPVI-TV's Inside Story. In 2003 Tierney headed Sam Katz's third campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, which he lost to incumbent mayor John F. Street. During the campaign, Tierney {{was involved in a}} highly publicized dispute with Neil Oxman. Oxman was a political consultant and friend of Sam Katz who worked on Katz's 1999 run for mayor. Oxman left Katz's 2003 campaign because he was unable to work with Tierney, saying Tierney was a [...] "shameless self-promoter" [...] and [...] "full of bullshit". Katz praised Tierney, who he said was full of optimism, which Katz said was a great asset <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> going poorly in the campaign and in Katz's personal life.|$|E

[...] She was then was fixed up sufficiently to make voyages as far north as Wrangell, Alaska. [...] When the Cassiar rush gave out, the Anderson was returned to Seattle, where she lay between 1877 and 1883, eventually sinking at her moorings.|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|While in bivouac in the Jordan Valley, it was {{a common}} {{practice}} <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> quiet, for soldiers to ride the few miles to Rujm El Bahr, at {{the northern end of}} the Dead Sea where the Jordan River runs in, to bathe themselves and their horses. This inland sea is about [...] long and about [...] wide with steep mountain country sloping down to the water on each side. The surface of the sea lies [...] below the sea-level of the Mediterranean and the water is extremely salty, containing about 25% mineral salts and is extremely buoyant; many of the horses were obviously perplexed at floating so high out of the water. It has been calculated that 6,500,000 tons of water fall into the Dead Sea daily from various streams, and as the sea has no outlet all of this water evaporates creating the humid heat of the atmosphere in the valley. There were also opportunities to swim in the Jordan River.|$|E
