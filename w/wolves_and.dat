5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|The stalk: The wolves {{attempt to}} conceal {{themselves}} as they approach. As {{the gap between the}} <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> their prey closes, the wolves quicken their pace, wag their tails, and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate <b>wolves,</b> <b>and</b> may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E
5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E

5|$|Animals, and {{products}} made from them, {{are used to}} assist in hunting. People have used hunting dogs to help chase down animals such as deer, <b>wolves,</b> <b>and</b> foxes; birds of prey from eagles to small falcons are used in falconry, hunting birds or mammals; and tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish.|$|E
5|$|Following the tour, Wright {{left the}} group {{to work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album Lock Up the <b>Wolves,</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Large wolf populations {{limit the}} numbers of small to {{medium-sized}} felines. Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. <b>Wolves</b> <b>and</b> cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations. In winter, however, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills. They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens. Wolves hunt steppe cats, and may scavenge from snow leopard kills. Wolves may also reduce Eurasian lynx populations. Wolves may kill lynxes by running them down, or killing them before they can escape into trees. Similar reports of encounters between <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> bobcats have been documented.|$|E

5|$|Timothy G. Breslin (December 8, 1967 – February 9, 2005) was a {{professional}} ice hockey left wing. Breslin played eight seasons in the International Hockey League (IHL) with the Phoenix Roadrunners and Chicago <b>Wolves</b> <b>and</b> part of a season in the ECHL with the South Carolina Stingrays. He also played major league roller hockey in Roller Hockey International (RHI) with the Chicago Cheetahs.|$|E
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
50|$|Some {{experts have}} {{suggested}} some subspecies of C. lupus be considered Canis species distinct from C. lupus. These include Central Asia's Himalayan <b>wolf,</b> <b>and</b> the Indian <b>wolf,</b> {{as well as}} the North America's red <b>wolf</b> <b>and</b> eastern <b>wolf.</b>|$|R

5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The {{results showed that}} the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire <b>wolves,</b> <b>and</b> that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{benefited from}} a strong sports culture. On August 1, 2006, it was named Best Sports City in the US by Sporting News. Chicagoans are famous for their rabid support of their home teams: the Chicago Bears, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago <b>Wolves,</b> <b>and</b> more recently, Chicago Sky (WNBA), Chicago Fire, the Chicago Red Stars (the new women's soccer team), and the Chicago Machine. Other {{events such as the}} Chicago Marathon, one of the five World Marathon Majors, would also play a part in Chicago's Olympic-planning process.|$|E

50|$|Shogun Assassin was {{edited and}} {{compiled}} {{from the first}} two films in the Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> Cub series, using 12 minutes of the first film, Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> Cub: Sword of Vengeance (Kozure Ōkami: Kowokashi udekashi tsukamatsuru or Wolf with Child in Tow: Child and Expertise for Rent), and most of Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx (Kozure Ōkami: Sanzu no kawa no ubaguruma or Wolf with Child in Tow: Perambulator of the River of Sanzu). Both were originally released in 1972. There were six films in all in the series. These in turn {{were based on the}} long-running 1970s manga series, Lone <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> Cub, created by the writer Kazuo Koike and the artist Goseki Kojima.|$|R
5|$|In eastern Serbia it was {{believed}} that ale who interact with people can metamorphose into humans or animals, after which their true selves can be seen only by so-called šestaci– men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet– though human-looking ale cause houses to shake when they enter. By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, ale that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big boars, or black <b>wolves,</b> <b>and</b> back.|$|E

5|$|The adult <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and {{in early}} 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon.

A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E

5000|$|Fabill 12 (The <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> the Lamb) {{similarly}} {{involves the}} characters of the <b>wolf</b> <b>and</b> a sheep, {{but this time it}} is a more straightforward expansion of The <b>Wolf</b> <b>and</b> the Lamb, one of Esope's bleakest [...] "stories". As in Fabill 11, the wolf pitilessly kills his victim. This time, however, the narrator's response in the moralitas (10 stanzas - the longest in the cycle) - is, or seems to be, completely different in terms of sympathies and more impassioned on the theme of social, political and legal injustice.|$|R
