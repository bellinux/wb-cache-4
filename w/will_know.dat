5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he <b>will</b> <b>know</b> infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E

By this time, the smaller competitors may well have grabbed that market niche.|$|E
