5|$|The Northwestern Wildcats {{football}} team hired Kafka as an offensive graduate assistant, {{with a focus}} on <b>wide</b> <b>receivers,</b> on March 29, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are the <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> (WR) and {{the tight}} ends (TE). <b>Wide</b> <b>receivers</b> line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> to wear jersey {{numbers in}} the 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, {{as long as it}} is not within the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E
