40|$|With over 66 % of Americans overweight, {{expectant}} {{mothers are}} unusual {{because they are}} encouraged to gain weight while pregnant. Food stamp receipt (FSR) may facilitate recommended weight gain for pregnant women by providing additional resources for food and nutrition. I {{examine the effects of}} FSR on the amount of weight gained by low-income expectant mothers using NLSY 79 data. Results indicate FSR decreases the probability gaining an insufficient amount of weight but does not exacerbate the probability of gaining too much weight. Examining the effects of FSR on pregnancy weight gain is important because low birth weight is more likely when expectant mothers gain an insufficient amount of <b>weight.</b> Food <b>stamps,</b> <b>weight,</b> weight gain...|$|R
500|$|When a {{cylinder}} is manufactured, its specification, including manufacturer, working pressure, test pressure, date of manufacture, capacity and <b>weight</b> are <b>stamped</b> on the cylinder. After {{a cylinder}} passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date {{in some countries}} such as Germany), is punched into {{the shoulder of the}} cylinder for easy verification at fill time. [...] The international standard for the stamp format is ISO 13769, [...] Gas cylinders - Stamp marking.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{first class}} stamps {{can also be}} used to mail letters abroad, {{providing}} that their combined value corresponds to the appropriate tariff by Swedish Post. For instance, to mail a letter up to 20 g in <b>weight,</b> two Brev <b>stamps</b> are required.|$|R
50|$|Transportable {{pressure}} vessels for high-pressure gases are routinely inspected and tested {{as part of}} the manufacturing process. They are generally marked as evidence of passing the tests, either individually or as part of a batch (some tests are destructive), and certified as meeting the standard of manufacture by the authorised testing agency, making them legal for import and sale. When a cylinder is manufactured, its specification, including manufacturer, working pressure, test pressure, date of manufacture, capacity and <b>weight</b> are <b>stamped</b> on the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|The {{microporosity}} of lacquers of stamped aluminium foils can {{be detected}} by a rapid electrolytic test method using an electrolyte containing a wetting agent. Material properties and manufacturing parameters influence the level of microporosity. The influence of lacquer <b>weight,</b> double lacquering, <b>stamping</b> depth, aluminium foil thickness, and type of stamping has been investigated. The microporosity is enhanced by insufficient lacquer thickness, reduced foil thicknesses and higher stamping depths...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{indigenous}} metallic coinage in the region, ca. 750-850 AD, {{comes from}} the Javanese kingdom of Sailendra (Chinese: Ho-ling). These roughly dome-shaped silver of irregular <b>weight</b> bore <b>stamps</b> of a flowing vase, and the sandalwood flower (quatefoil). By 850 AD weights had been standardized at 20 rattis to a Massa of about 2.4 grams. Silver and gold coins of Massa and fractional denominations were issued until about 1300 AD, with changes in shape and quality of inscription marking periods of issue. The gold Piloncitos of the Philippines are a late offshoot of the gold coinage, while the bean-like silver [...] "namo" [...] series, of the Malay isthmus was presumably {{an offshoot of the}} silver and may have evolved into the bullet (Pod-Duang) coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.|$|R
60|$|Then he was {{conducted}} to another room, and shown the tables at which men were busy counting sheets of postage-stamps and putting them up in envelopes for {{all parts of the}} United Kingdom. The officer in charge told him that the <b>weight</b> of <b>stamps</b> sent out from that room averaged a little over three tons daily, and that the average value of the weekly issue was 150,000 pounds. Then he was led into a fireproof safe--a solid stone apartment--which was piled from floor to ceiling with sheets of postage-stamps of different values. Those for letters ranged from one halfpenny to one pound, but those used for telegrams ran up to as much as five pounds sterling for a single stamp. Taking down from a shelf a packet of these high-priced stamps, which was {{about the size of a}} thick octavo book, the official stated that it was worth 35,000 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Sutton arrives, Ballard's nephew Fritz is {{murdered by}} a mysterious cloaked {{figure in the}} same manner that Adolph was killed—crushed beneath the massive <b>weight</b> of a <b>stamp</b> mill, a huge {{apparatus}} used to pulverize rock to unearth valuable ore. Sutton and Tex find that the ranch guests all have alibis. Soon the mysterious cloaked figure strikes again, shooting young John, attacking Sutton, and slashing Flora's throat. While the investigation continues, Jim, who is apparently an invalid, takes a turn for the worse, prompting Sutton to contact his ex-wife who hasn't been to the ranch in thirty years.|$|R
5000|$|These stamps {{were issued}} {{following}} a Commission of Inquiry which had carefully studied the postal systems of Europe and America. In {{the opinion of}} Geoffrey Clarke, the reformed system was to be maintained [...] "for {{the benefit of the}} people of India and not for the purpose of swelling the revenue." [...] The Commissioners voted to abolish the earlier practice of conveying official letters free of postage ("franking"). The new system was recommended by the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, and adopted by the East India Company's Court of Directors. It introduced [...] "low and uniform" [...] rates for sending mail efficiently throughout the country within the jurisdiction of the East India Company. The basic rate was 1/2 anna on letters not more than 1/4 tola in <b>weight.</b> The <b>stamps</b> were needed to show the postage was prepaid, a basic principle of the new system, like the fundamental changes of the British system advocated by Rowland Hill and the Scinde reforms of Bartle Frere. These reforms transformed mail services within India.|$|R
60|$|People held {{themselves}} high; {{they held}} themselves personally aloof from people not duly assayed; their civilization was still Puritan though their belief had long {{ceased to be}} so. They had <b>weights</b> and measure, <b>stamped</b> in an earlier time, a time surer of itself than ours, by which they rated the merit of all comers, and rejected such as did not bear the test. These standards were their own, and they were satisfied with them; most Americans have no standards of their own, {{but these are not}} satisfied even with other people's, and so our society {{is in a state of}} tolerant and tremulous misgiving.|$|R
50|$|The ore {{was crushed}} in a fifteen-stamp mill. The <b>weight</b> of <b>stamps</b> was seven {{hundred and fifty}} pounds, {{dropping}} seven inches 90 times per minute, and crushing through No. 5 round-punched screens. The duty per stamp was one and two-thirds tons per day. No rockbreakers or self-feeders were used, but {{the introduction of the}} same was contemplated. Steel shoes and iron dies were used. The sulphurets were saved on six Frue concentrators. The chlorination plant owned by the mine was formerly the property of the Merrifield Company. It contained one roasting furnace 75 x 10 ft inside measurement. It had a capacity of four tons per day; when sufficient sulphurets had accumulated, a run is made. The sulphurets of the Mountaineer Mine was usually treated in these works. The cost of treatment was $8 per ton. The mine was provided with water power throughout; three Pelton wheels were used: a 5 ft for plunger, and an 8 ft for hoisting. Power for the mill was obtained from a 5 ft wheel. Altogether a total of 75 inches of power water was used under a head of 120 ft feet.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{they entered}} into a dark region where, from a {{careening}} building, a dozen gruesome doorways gave up loads of babies to {{the street and the}} gutter. A wind of early autumn raised yellow dust from cobble and swirled it against an hundred windows. Long streamers of garments fluttered from fire escapes. In all unhandy places there were buckets, brooms, rags, and bottles. In the street infants played or fought with other infants or sat stupidly in the way of vehicles. Formidable women, with uncombed hair and disordered dress, gossiped while leaning on railings, or screamed in frantic quarrels. Withered persons, in curious postures of submission to something, sat smoking pipes in obscure corners. A thousand odors of cooking food came forth to the street. The building quivered and creaked from the <b>weight</b> of humanity <b>stamping</b> about in its bowels.|$|R
25|$|Ore {{from the}} Golden Gate line of reefs was crushed {{initially}} at the Enterprise battery on Station (now Belmore) Creek. Owned by the Golden Gate Milling Company, the Croydon Consols battery (also known as Richardson's mill) comprised one 18 horsepower steam engine, 15 <b>stamps</b> <b>weight</b> nine hundredweight, six Berdan or Wheeler pans, and one pump and was valued at £3,000 in 1900. The mill was effectively double in size {{the next year}} with one 32 horsepower steam engine, 30 stamps weighing ten hundredweight, 12 Berdan and Wheeler pans, three Whifley concentrators, and four pumps valued at £6,000. The following year another steam engine was obtained and a dam was constructed bringing the value to £7,000. The mill's production declined rapidly after 1906, however it was still employing 16 hands in 1913 and had five or six others employed obtaining lime from Sweers Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{show the}} data {{collected}} in the census in museums and warehouses {{in the province of}} Verona on the materials relevant to the Roman era in the production of wool spinning and weaving. From this survey it was observed as in the area have retained more of the texture-related artifacts than those for spinning, while taking into account the difference of material they are made of these objects (bone / clay). The contexts from which the artifacts are mainly related to the activity of spinning scope funeral while the weights for weaving often come from uncertain contexts and surveys. Interesting are the body types of these weights and the weight value of these. Another important finding is the high percentage of decorated loom <b>weights</b> matrix and <b>stamps</b> compared to the other provinces studied, some of these are, in fact, concentrated my analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Waddell {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, shortly before the American Civil War. Although raised respectable upper-middle-class family, he became known as a high stakes gambler and was {{eventually}} cut off by his family {{before the age of}} 21.

5000|$|Blaustein {{focuses on}} three famous wrestlers, {{one at the}} height of his career (Mick Foley, aka [...] "Mankind"), one contemplating {{retirement}} (Terry Funk) and one at a career low (Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts). He begins by following Funk, a 53-year-old man in need of knee surgery who appears unable to retire, despite the mounting toll wrestling is taking on his body. Blaustein follows him as he competes at hardcore wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal. Funk also appears with his friend, former wrestler Dennis Stamp, who is eager to work as a referee in Funk's upcoming [...] "retirement" [...] match. Stamp discusses the fact that he has not wrestled in years, but remains in shape just in case he gets the call, and demonstrates his unusual workout regimen: jumping on a trampoline in his back yard while holding hand <b>weights.</b> Some of <b>Stamp's</b> phrases would later become popular memes.|$|R
40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has been}} widely studied and increasingly applied in the automotive industry. This process is characterized by its ability to stamp high strength steels, yielding products with high mechanical strength, thus reducing the <b>weight</b> of <b>stamped</b> components and therefore the vehicles weight. It also demands less energy because steel sheets can be heated by induction, more efficient than electric furnaces. With controlled thinning, {{it is possible to}} manufacture thinner stamped parts with high mechanical strength, therefore it is necessary to know the formability limits to prevent failure and achieve the largest possible thickness reduction. In this work the hot formability of DIN 27 MnCrB 5 steel sheets 4 mm thick, under thinning conditibns was evaluated by numerical simulation with the finite element (FEM) software Forge 2008. Tensile tests were carried out at 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C and with strain rates from 0. 1 to 4 s(- 1). With the results of tensile tests, it was possible to calculate Hensel-Spittel coefficients to model the steel sheet and simulate the hot Nakazima test to evaluate the highest dome which could be formed without failure risks caused by sheet thinning. Simulation results obtained with specimens 200 mm long and 125, 150 or 200 mm wide that were stamped at 930 degrees C, showed the radial position and dome height associated to plastic instability as well provided the thickness distribution along the specimen. The numerical results were compared to experimental tests and showed a good agreement in terms of failure initiation and localization. As a result, a new numerical and experimental strategy was elaborated to define the hot formability based on the plastic instability and necking localization as a function of stamping temperature and blank dimensions. This strategy proved to be useful to define the safe formability region and therefore the larger thickness reduction that can be done during hot stamping to reduce vehicular components weight and to avoid cracks and failures usually observed in components like clutch covers.

40|$|The {{assemblage}} of weights recovered from excavations at Port Royal, Jamaica {{is the largest}} collection of seventeenth-century weights recovered from a single colonial site. On June 7, 1692, just shortly before noon, an earthquake shook the community of Port Royal and {{in a matter of}} minutes, due to a process known as liquefaction, approximately thirty-two acres of the colonial port community sank below the waters of Kingston Harbor. To date, 90 weights have been recovered from nautical and terrestrial excavations at the site. Many of these bear the stamps and ciphers of English trade guilds as well as owners marks and regal stamps of authority. Several weights in the collection also bear a mark {{in the shape of a}} dagger or sword, which is associated with the City of London. Bronze and lead <b>weights</b> bearing cipher <b>stamps</b> offer a unique opportunity for archaeological and historical investigation. Combining data from archaeological excavations with information from wills, inventories and data from comparative assemblage known as the Streeter Collection, will result in a multi disciplinary analysis of the weights collection that has the potential for contributing a great deal of information about local and long distance trade and commercial patterns in colonial Jamaica. From a micro perspective, this analysis will contribute to the broader understanding of life and economic activities within the excavated area of the colonial port community. From a macro perspective, analysis of the weights should corroborate reforms in English law regarding the economic necessity for standardization of weights. Analysis of weight iconography suggests differences in mind-set that may have contributed in placing England apart from other European countries, in an advantageous position to become a leading economic force in the seventeenth century. An in depth analysis of the weight collection associated with seventeenth-century Port Royal will draw many sources of data together, offering new perspectives on the colonial Jamaican process...|$|R
