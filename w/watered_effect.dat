50|$|Moire is a waved or <b>watered</b> <b>effect</b> {{produced}} {{especially on}} grosgrain silk and woolen moreen via engraved rollers and high pressure on carded material. The {{end result is}} a peculiar luster which works best when made from a corded fabric like grosgrain.|$|E
50|$|Calendering is a {{finishing}} process used on cloth, paper, or plastic film. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material. With textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures. Calendering {{is used on}} fabrics such as moire to produce its <b>watered</b> <b>effect</b> and also on cambric and some types of sateens.|$|E
50|$|Moire {{fabric is}} more {{delicate}} than {{fabric of the}} same type that has not gone through the calendering process. Also, contact with water removes the watermark and causes staining. Moire feels thin, glossy and papery due to the calendering process. Generally moire {{is made out of}} fabrics with a good body and defined ribs, such as grosgrain. Fabrics with defined ribs show the <b>watered</b> <b>effect</b> better than smooth fabrics like satin. Taffeta also works well. Fabrics with defined enough ribs can be calendered with smooth rollers and produce a moire finish; however generally the rollers have ribs that correspond to the grain of the fabric. The moire effect may be obtained on silk, worsted, or cotton fabrics, though it is impossible to develop it on anything other than a grained or fine corded weave.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper we}} study the {{condition}} where the <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect</b> is occurs in pipe line. Water hammer {{can cause the}} pipe to break if the pressure is high enough. The experiment will be set-up to investigate the <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect</b> {{in order to avoid}} the <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect</b> happen. The prevention of <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect</b> will be propose and prove the prevention method is successfully reduce the <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect.</b> The prevention method using is installing the bypass pipe with non-return valve. The experiment is done by capture the vibration signal by using data acquisition device and accelerometer. The pressure signal is capture after a sudden shutoff for the valve. The signal is than analyze and convert to wave speed. The project is differentiating and compares the water hammer phenomenon with different pipe material, pipe length, inlet diameter of pipe, and pressure in pipeline. From the experiment, result shown that the lower strength material pipe, smaller inlet diameter pipe, and longer pipe will deal with lager <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect.</b> Besides, the prevention method by installing by pass pipe with non-return valve of <b>water</b> hammer <b>effect</b> is proved successfully reduce the water hammer phenomenon by 33. 33 % of pressure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- A <b>water</b> <b>effect</b> {{correction}} algorithm {{was developed}} by our research team in order to correct/remove <b>water</b> <b>effects</b> for improved detection of SAV (Submerged Aquatic Vegetation) from remotely sensed hyperspectral data. The algorithm was implemented in IDL (Interactive Data Language) and incorporated to ENVI as user-defined module. This paper specifically explains the two different methods in presenting outputs from the module: spectral profiles of selected pixels and two-dimensional images on the significant spectral bands. These significant bands were identified and further verified {{with a series of}} PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and a subsequent clustering process, and utilized for presenting output images and spectral profiles within the correction module...|$|R
50|$|To {{aid in the}} {{construction}} of The Dark Knight, both Batman & Robin: The Chiller and Movietown <b>Water</b> <b>Effect</b> were removed. The roller coaster primarily occupies the previous location of the Movietown <b>Water</b> <b>Effect,</b> with the queue area placed in front of the building. Original plans called for the demolition of the Batman & Robin: The Chiller station and observatory but were later excluded from demolition plans. The exit was originally slated to go through the present Justice League gift shop adjacent to the ride, but this {{turned out not to be}} the case. On May 15, 2008, The Dark Knight officially opened to the public.|$|R

5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel <b>water</b> <b>effects,</b> smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and <b>water</b> <b>effects</b> only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|R
