5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, while birds <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.|$|E

5|$|Samsulbahri (sometimes spelled Sjamsulbahri; {{abbreviated}} Samsu) is {{the primary}} male protagonist.

These physical attributes have been described by Keith Foulcher, a lecturer of Indonesian language and literature at the University of Sydney, as indicating Samsu's mimicry and collaborationist nature. His good looks are also seen as a physical manifestation of his moral and kind nature.|$|E

5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on top of the}} head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake {{represented}} as well as the fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E

40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{eye-tracking}} {{and conversation}} analysis {{this study examined the}} impact of video-conferencing on communication. Paired participants performed a collaborative task over four communication media: face-to-face; desktop video-conferencing <b>with</b> <b>eye</b> contact; and life-size video-conferencing <b>with</b> and without <b>eye</b> contact. Participants more frequently checked the information their partner verbally relayed when communicating face-to-face and over life-size video-conferencing <b>with</b> <b>eye</b> contact. They also looked more at their partner when conversing over life-size video-conferencing <b>with</b> <b>eye</b> contact compared to the other conditions. The results imply that the mode across which we communicate does influence our verbal and non-verbal interactions but that people still prefer to talk face-to-face...|$|R

5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> included {{attempts to}} change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
5|$|Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn {{investigate}} a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake {{may have been}} captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a ventilation shaft. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered <b>with</b> <b>eyes.</b> As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate and shoot laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady.|$|E
5|$|Within Stereospondyli, Yates and Warren erected {{two major}} clades: Capitosauria and Trematosauria. Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes {{near the back}} of the skull. Trematosaurs include a {{diversity}} of temnospondyls, including large marine trematosauroids, aquatic plagiosaurs, brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous, and metoposauroids <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> near the front of their heads. In 2000, paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls, the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria, and included groups like Lydekkerinidae, Rhytidosteidae, and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used, Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses. Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians, but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls.|$|E

5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless <b>with</b> <b>eyes</b> open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre <b>with</b> <b>eyes.</b> Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed the treacherous woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E
