25|$|Ferris {{admits that}} there is a {{tendency}} for descriptions of cosmology towards philosophy and also to lean towards theology. His theories lean towards the basis that the span of human being existence is part of the universe design. His views of God are not as taught in churches and synagogs but that the existence of the ultimate cause and the essential nature of things are really unknown. He points out that one can not support the personal theology theories of conventional religions against today's established principles of cosmology. Ferris <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> his book with intellectual arguments for God with his Contrarian Theological Afterword.|$|E

25|$|His best-known {{and most}} highly {{regarded}} {{work is the}} multi-volume novel The Book of the New Sun. Set in a bleak, distant future influenced by Jack Vance's Dying Earth series, the story details the life of Severian, a journeyman torturer, exiled from his guild for showing compassion {{to one of the}} condemned. The novel is composed of the volumes The Shadow of the Torturer (1980), The Claw of the Conciliator (1981), winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel, The Sword of the Lictor (1982), and The Citadel of the Autarch (1983). A coda, The Urth of the New Sun (1987), <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> some loose ends but is generally considered a separate work. Several Wolfe essays about the writing of The Book of the New Sun were published in The Castle of the Otter (1982); the title refers to a misprint of the fourth book's title in Locus magazine).|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play {{is very much in}} keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three is something of a sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E

500|$|Fogel {{commented on}} Gaga's lack of {{experience}} in a tour and {{said that it was}} an opportunity for her. [...] "As an artist with that kind of talent and vision emerges, it creates a lot of excitement, and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show. Over {{the course of the next}} many months we're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible", Fogel added. [...] "It's an across the board home run." [...] Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Caryn Grant {{wrote that}} [...] "the album {{is at its}} strongest when Madonna shoves {{everyone}} {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight. So it's fitting that she <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright's {{purpose in}} {{publishing}} {{this work was}} so that his innocence and the unfairness of his trial be recognized, and that [...] "his views on {{the process by which}} the saved acquired grace be accepted as correct, even orthodox". He chose to emphasize seven theological issues which he divided into three [...] "propositions," [...] and four [...] "theses". The three propositions consisted of the substance of Wheelwright's doctrine, which provided the basis for his fast-day sermon. Following the propositions, but before the theses, are nine pages of text recounting the events and personalities of the Antinomian Controversy. Here Wheelwright says that justice was not served, and that he was accused of the political crimes of sedition and contempt, when the real reason for his banishment was doctrinal differences with the other ministers. He goes on to accuse his prosecutors of engaging in [...] "underhanded dealings," [...] and working in secret. He had learned of these dealings through a magistrate friend (possibly William Coddington) who secretly transcribed some of these proceedings and gave them to him. In this section Cotton's defense of Wheelwright is included: [...] "I do conceive and profess that our Brother Wheelwright's Doctrine is according to God..." [...] (these words published by Cotton in his 1648 Way of Congregational Churches Cleared). Wheelwright then <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> this middle section by [...] "vehemently accusing Weld of lying," [...] and deceiving his readers.|$|E

500|$|Atwell had stated on {{potential}} further seasons, [...] "We {{think that there}} could be more to come....the [...] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it and leaving it there." [...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E

[...] "Effective psychotherapy requires a conscious, rational, scientific code of ethics", says Branden, and he identifies that code as the Objectivist ethics of Ayn Rand.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} D+, stating that [...] "a few of the images are startling" [...] but [...] "Silent Hill is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness."

[...] According to Nathan Lee of The New York Times: [...] "It begins as a quest, develops into a ghost-town mystery, devolves into a preposterous cautionary tale about witchcraft and religious fundamentalism, and <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> like the outrageously overwrought fantasy of a movie nerd obsessed with horror who has been given obscene amounts of money to adapt a video game." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 21, 2006, a {{few days}} after the premiere of SG-1 {{milestone}} episode [...] "200", the Sci Fi Channel confirmed that Stargate SG-1 was not being renewed for an eleventh season. While news outlets cited declining ratings, expensive production and lack of promotion as possible reasons for the cancellation, the Sci Fi Channel's Mark Stern merely stated the decision was not ratings-based. Instead, he said the production staff was given enough time to tie up all the loose ends of the story and SG-1 cast members were planned to be incorporated into the renewed Stargate Atlantis. Meanwhile, the SG-1 producers and rights-holder MGM expressed a desire to continue SG-1 as a movie, mini-series, or an eleventh season on another network. Brad Wright confirmed the production of two direct-to-DVD films in October 2006, and Amanda Tapping joined the Atlantis cast for their fourth season.

Boiler Gold Rush activities include speaker presentations from various academic, cultural, safety and professional organizations on campus, campus tours led by Team Leaders, academic 'meet the schools' picnic and interest sessions, late night events at the Purdue Memorial Union, Recreational Sports Center and local stores, and a sports pep rally. Purdue University Dance Marathon (PUDM) is an 18-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping, dance marathon that takes place each fall in the Cordova Recreation center. Each year over 2,000 students participate and the event raises over $1,000,000 annually for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis.

2500|$|The worlds created {{specifically}} for the series predominantly feature original and Final Fantasy characters and figure more centrally to the overarching plot of the Kingdom Hearts series. The first world of each game serves as a tutorial to introduce new gameplay elements and frame the story. Destiny Islands, the home world of the main characters, Sora, Riku, and Kairi, serves this function {{at the beginning of}} the first game and Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded. The next available world serves as a hub world, where the player returns multiple times throughout the game to unfold the main story. Traverse Town, a world cobbled together from the remains of worlds destroyed by the Heartless, fills this role in Kingdom Hearts, but becomes the tutorial world in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. The penultimate world of each game <b>wraps</b> <b>up</b> many plot threads in preparation for the final world. Hollow Bastion is this world for Kingdom Hearts, but in Kingdom Hearts II, it is the hub world. Twilight Town is both the tutorial world and the penultimate world in Kingdom Hearts II, containing a secret pathway to the final world of that game. The final world culminates in a battle with the main antagonist of the game. The [...] "End of the World", made out of the worlds that lost their hearts to the Heartless, and the [...] "World That Never Was" [...] are the final worlds of Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, respectively. In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the Land of Departure serves as the tutorial world, while the final world in the game is the Keyblade Graveyard, where each of the main characters' final battles take place prior to the game's final episode.|$|E
