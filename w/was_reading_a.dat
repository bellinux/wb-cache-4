5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as an {{episode in the}} series Agatha Christie's Poirot in 2001 {{starring}} David Suchet. It was mostly filmed on Burgh Island, Devon & Burgh Island Hotel, a location which inspired the writer's original novel and also And Then There Were None. Some changes {{were made in the}} adaptation. Kenneth Marshall's 16-year-old daughter Linda became a 17-year-old son Lionel. Instead of practising magic, Lionel <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> book about poisoning and did not attempt suicide. The Gardeners were not among the guests. As with many of the early Poirot TV adaptations, the characters of Captain Hastings, Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon had larger roles than in the novel, with Hastings accompanying Poirot at the resort, Japp investigating the murder (a role performed by Colonel Weston in the book) and Lemon investigating Alice Corrigan's murder at Poirot's behest. This episode marked Japp's and Lemon's last appearances for ten years, until making their final appearances in The Big Four.|$|E
25|$|The Ji Gong {{mentioned}} above, {{better known}} as Ji Jike (姬際可) or Ji Longfeng (姬隆丰), {{is said to have}} trained in Shaolin Monastery for ten years as a young man and was matchless with the spear. As the story goes, he later traveled to Xongju Cave on Mount Zhongnan to receive a boxing manual written by Yue Fei, from which he learned Xingyi. However, some believe Ji actually created the style himself and attributed it to Yue Fei because he was fighting the Manchus, descendants of the Jurchens who Yue had struggled against. Ji supposedly created it after watching a battle between an eagle and a bear during the Ming dynasty. Other sources say he created it while training in Shaolin. He <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> book and looked up to see two roosters fighting, which inspired him to imitate the fighting styles of animals. Both versions of the story (eagle / bear and roosters) state he continued to study the actions of animals and eventually increased the cadre of animal forms.|$|E

500|$|Lhasa {{was born}} in Big Indian, New York, of a Mexican father, {{language}} instructor Alejandro [...] "Alex" [...] Sela, and an American mother, photographer and actress Alexandra Karam. According to Lhasa, her hippie parents did not give her a name {{until the age of}} five months; her mother <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> book about Tibet and the word Lhasa [...] "just grabbed her" [...] as the right name for the baby girl. Lhasa's maternal grandmother was Elena Karam (1909–2001), an actress best known for her leading role in Elia Kazan's film America America. Her paternal grandmother was Carmen de Obarrio (1906–1982), a Panamanian pianist who studied in Los Angeles with Egon Petri, and with Edgar Varèse in San Francisco. Lhasa had a Lebanese great-grandfather named Basel who sang in six languages. Her mother played harp and her father played flute. Her first decade was spent criss-crossing the United States and Mexico, living and traveling in a converted school bus with her parents and siblings, home-schooled by her mother. Both her parents spoke fluent Spanish, but she was raised speaking primarily English, with Spanish added during a total of eight years' residence in Mexico. Along with her family she listened {{to a wide variety of}} recordings including songs by Chilean musician Victor Jara; as a young child she dreamed of marrying him some day, not knowing he had been killed.|$|E

He was a plump, bald, ebullient southerner who had once served five years in a prison on a charge of exposing himself before a group of children and was now the head of a religious diploma mill in Florida and of a seedy, flat-roofed stucco church called the Church of Holy Love, Incorporated.

French, for instance, was a Creole of Latin before it became the [...] "official" [...] language. English is always in transition, although the Standard version {{is more likely to}} be frozen in its glass cube. But spoken, English is a busy traffic of dialects, accents, and slang words going in and out of fashion. Slang is especially fascinating. I love outdated slang dictionaries—these words are artifacts that tell you the mindset and squeamish taboos of a certain milieu during a certain time period. I wanted the English in the book to be a hyperbole of that everyday dynamism of spoken English." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{about a year}} {{living at}} Dōgen's new temple, Ejō was {{accepted}} as a student and ordained into the lineage on 15 August 1235. Shortly after this event, Ejō {{took part in the}} planning of the sōdō (僧堂; meditation hall) which was to be built there, and also oversaw its dedication in October 1236. According to surviving records, it was around this time that Ejō had an enlightenment experience. Dōgen <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> kōan to his students in which a monk asks Shishuang Chuyuan, [...] "How is it that one hair digs many ditches"?, reportedly triggering his experience. This is thought to have taken place in November 1236. According to Dairyō Gumon, writing much later in the 17th century, Ejō received dharma transmission from Dōgen just after this event, complete with the presentation of certification documents. The following month, Ejō was made shuso (首座; head monk). Following these events, regardless of the veracity of Gumon's claims, contemporary historical sources such as the Denkōroku agree that Ejō was treated as Dōgen's heir, serving as his closest attendant. The [...] "Denkōroku states: [...] "Throughout the day, he was inseparable from the master, like a trailing shadow".|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the first}} of June 1780, the British army {{established}} a fortified outpost at Rocky Mount on the upper Catawba River, near the North Carolina border, and placed a garrison there under Lieutenant Colonel George Turnbull, a career British officer who commanded a British Provincial regiment called the New York Volunteers. In early July, Turnbull ordered Christian Huck, a Philadelphia lawyer and a captain in Tarleton's British Legion, to find the rebel leaders and persuade other area residents to swear allegiance to the king. A native of Germany, Huck {{was one of many}} Pennsylvania Loyalists whose property was confiscated after the British evacuated Philadelphia. He was then banished from the state and joined the British army at New York. Huck was a remarkably poor choice for this assignment because he held a great deal of bitterness toward the Whigs in general, and the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians in particular. During an earlier incursion into what was then called the Upper District between the Broad and Catawba Rivers (modern Chester County, South Carolina), his troops had murdered an unarmed boy, reportedly while he <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>a</b> Bible, and burnt the home and library of Rev. John Simpson, a Whig leader and influential Presbyterian minister. A week later, Huck and his men invaded the New Acquisition District (roughly modern York County, South Carolina), and destroyed the ironworks of William Hill, another influential Whig. Residents who had only wanted to be left alone had then joined the Patriots.|$|E
