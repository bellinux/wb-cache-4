5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E
25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E

Least <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>'s</b> {{to ask for a}} little shelter; what do you think?" [...] and smiling sarcastically, as though deprecating his {{intention}} to keep dry, he rapped on the door of a prosperous-looking cottage.|$|R

25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, {{and use it as a}} model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E
500|$|In the 2015 film The Martian, the NASA JPL {{engineer}} Tim Grimes {{refers to}} the Algonquin Round Table when describing the crude communication JPL had established with stranded astronaut Mark Whatney: [...] "Thirty-two minute round trip communications time, all {{he can do is}} ask yes/no questions, and all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> point the camera. This won't exactly be an Algonquin Round Table of snappy repartee." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 July, three students, {{as part of}} a {{group called}} Local Action started a hunger strike at the pier. Hunger striker Chan King-fai said: [...] "The {{government}} wasn't chosen by us. All <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to use our humble and limited voices." [...] The government responded with a communications offensive, announcing that Secretary for Development Carrie Lam would appear on RTHK's City's Forum and at a public forum on 29 July at the pier.|$|E

[...] "Outdatedness of Human Beings 1", 5th edition [...] "The {{three main}} theses: {{that we are}} {{no match for the}} {{perfection}} of our products; that we produce more than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> visualize and take responsibility for; and that we believe, that, what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>are</b> allowed to <b>do,</b> no: should do, no: must do - these three basic theses, in light of the environmental threats emerging over the last quarter century, have become more prevailing and urgent than they were then." ...|$|R

500|$|The party turned {{for home}} on 27 January, picking up Spencer-Smith on 29th. He was by now {{physically}} helpless {{and had to}} be loaded on to the sledge. Mackintosh was soon unable to pull, and could only stagger along beside the sledge; by this time the de facto leadership of the group had passed to Joyce and Richards. Joyce described the group's plight: [...] "I have never known such shocking conditions. This is one of the hardest pulls since we have trekked...all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to slog on with the greatest possible speed." ...|$|E
500|$|The discoverers {{named the}} new element after the {{university}} and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named. However, the element directly above element98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that simply means [...] "hard to get at" [...] so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention. They added that [...] "the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to point out ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California." ...|$|E
500|$|SEAL Team 10's sniper. Wahlberg {{recommended}} Foster to Berg, as {{they had}} previously collaborated on Contraband (2012). Prior to filming, Foster met with the fallen serviceman's family and friends to understand the person he would be portraying. [...] "It was such a rich opportunity {{to listen to the}} Axelsons talk about their son. Their generosity and inclusiveness with me was so touching and open. They love to talk about their boy because they love him; so we, in turn, love him. We can’t bring him back, but what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> aim, every day, to do the best that we can to honor him." ...|$|E

500|$|Tony Stratton-Smith formed Charisma Records {{and signed}} the band {{as his first}} act, who {{recorded}} their second album, The Least <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Wave to Each Other from 11–14 December 1969 with producer John Anthony in Trident Studios. Hammill's voice was electronically treated on [...] "After the Flood", while [...] "Refugees" [...] and [...] "White Hammer" [...] featured cello and cornet respectively. Because the band finished ahead of their rehearsal schedule, Potter decided to overdub some electric guitar – an instrument he had never played before. The album was released in February 1970 and made the top 50 in the U.K, Melody Maker said [...] "If all our groups were as together as this, the British music scene would improve ten-fold." ...|$|E
500|$|Adrian Sutil in the Spyker {{opted to}} start from the pitlane. Massa got off to the best {{possible}} start and retained his lead, but Räikkönen passed Hamilton into Turn One. At {{the back of the}} field, Anthony Davidson hit the back of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. The Toro Rosso came back onto the track and smashed {{into the side of the}} Super Aguri. Liuzzi said afterwards that [...] "all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> wait for Silverstone and hope that the definite improvement we have made with the car pays off". At the Adelaide hairpin, Jarno Trulli rammed into the back of Heikki Kovalainen. Trulli was out, but Kovalainen continued at the back of the field. Trulli apologised to Kovalainen after the race, and declared it [...] "a racing accident". The tangle promoted Alonso up to eighth.|$|E
500|$|Neither {{the police}} nor the fire {{department}} officially supported the project. The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part. The department's deputy chief medical officer Dr. David Prezant said, [...] "It's not our job to say you can't go. All <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> say there's no proven evidence it works." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins {{all in the}} first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The only thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to respond." [...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} then {{referred}} to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was informed on 26February 2009 by the Special Crime Division of the CPS that the Crown would not oppose the appeal. The case {{then went to the}} Court of Appeal, where, in light of the new DNA evidence available, Hodgson's conviction was quashed. The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18March 2009 concluded: [...] "The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is that we do not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope {{for the sake of the}} appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. All <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 3. The Land of We All [...] "It is {{an obvious}} but simple {{distinction}} — though rarely made — {{that there are some}} things that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> humanity, and some things that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> persons, and that there is some radical and absolute difference between the two classes of things. They do not overlap. A person can no more invade Normandy than an army can play the violin." ...|$|R
500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and that all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} the thinking behind {{his work in}} Germany in an interview published in the Aufbau on March 11, 1966: [...] "A new generation is growing up that was not born when the horrible crime was committed and for which they cannot be held responsible.

2500|$|The Massachusetts {{legislature}} took up {{the repeal}} of the 1913 law the next month. On July 15, the Massachusetts Senate voted to repeal it on a unanimous voice vote. The House approved the legislation on July 29 on a 118 to 35 vote and Governor Deval Patrick signed it on July 31. It took effect immediately. He said: [...] "I think other states will make their own judgments, and I expect them to–that's their own business. All <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> tend our own garden, and make sure that it's weeded, and I think we've weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have." ...|$|E
