In his 1970 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, he said [...] "Hey Jude" [...] was worthy of an A-side, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> both." [...] In 1980, he told Playboy he still disagreed with the decision.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{marriage}} {{produced no}} children. Janine had two children, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Janine had two failed pregnancies and Anquetil grew upset in 1970 that he wasn't a father. The couple considered a surrogate mother before Janine {{thought of her}} daughter, Annie. Janine said: [...] "We didn't use the parental authority that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently. Annie always had the choice of refusing." [...] Annie confirmed her mother's recollection. She said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Big Otter," [...] {{repeated}} Lumley, [...] "to {{dance at}} our wedding. But {{it is of}} no use to sigh after the impossible. The days of miracles are over, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{am quite}} sure," [...] he continued, [...] "that it would <b>have</b> afforded as much {{satisfaction}} {{to you as}} it would to my dear wife and me, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>had</b> our sedate friend, Big Otter--" ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, many's the cry I have, over {{reflecting}} {{that maybe}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Young Harmony for Livy, and didn't have wit {{enough to think}} of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And how terribly galling it all is, when <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{that man}} under the {{guillotine}} by now, {{if you had}} not blundered so terribly last year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] {{interrupted}} the sympathetic sergeant, [...] "I only wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Osman Digna there too! It {{would do more}} to pacify the Soudan than killing his men does!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS. Oh, don't {{speak of}} it. We {{are the ones}} who ought to apologize. But if you only <b>had</b> been somebody, it would <b>have</b> been such a good joke! <b>We</b> <b>could</b> always <b>have</b> <b>had</b> such a laugh over it, don't you see? ...|$|R
6000|$|Decoud, exchanging {{a steady}} stare with Mrs. Gould, added, tentatively, as it were, [...] "And yet, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done." ...|$|R

60|$|FANNY. I hate tact. [Newte laughs.] <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> such a jolly little lunch together. I'm {{all alone}} till the evening. There were ever {{so many things}} I {{wanted to talk to}} you about.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was horrid to be fetched home so soon, just {{as there}} was a chance of {{something}} nice; when all the tiresome big ones had gone to dress, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some real fun,' said Valetta.|$|E
6000|$|And {{still the}} King hung back and was afraid. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>have</b> <b>had</b> him there to back {{us with his}} authority! Bedford <b>had</b> lost heart and decided to waive {{resistance}} and go an concentrate his strength in the best and loyalest province remaining to him--Normandy. Ah, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> persuaded the King to come and countenance us with his presence and approval at this supreme moment! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} sixteen come Lammas day, and Stephen fifteen at Martinmas day, sir," [...] said Ambrose; [...] "but verily <b>we</b> did nought. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done nought <b>had</b> not the thieves thought more were behind us." ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{history of}} the great housing boom and bust between 2003 and 2006 <b>has</b> not yet been written; {{this is a first}} attempt. It <b>has</b> been done here not to show that “mistakes were made” but to {{reconstruct}} the subjective horizon that drove people to act in a certain way during that time period, their justifications and rationalizations, often against a multi-media show of doubt. We hope, the collective investment community, can then honestly address the question of when <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have,</b> would <b>have,</b> and should <b>have</b> pulled pack in the respective investment horizons...|$|R
60|$|That night--I {{am still}} {{speaking}} {{of the first day}} of our circumnavigation of the plateau--a great experience awaited us, and one which for ever set at rest any doubt which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> as to the wonders so near us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the fight," [...] said General Lambert, [...] "the {{fight between}} little Norval and the {{gigantic}} Norwegian--that {{would have been}} rare sport: and you should write, Jack, and suggest it to Mr. Rich, the manager." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You may try {{as much as}} you like, Master Joyce,” {{the sailor}} said, shaking his head solemnly, “but mark my words, you won’t be able to do it. It is a pity, too, for with all this wood that has been drying as if on purpose for us, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> one without being afraid of the smoke.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Could</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> at {{that moment}} but half the powder and balls with which we began this battle on Breed's hill, there would never <b>have</b> been a red-coated soldier show his head above our line of works and lived to tell of it.|$|R
6000|$|... [Abbotsford,] July 2.--Late at Court. Got to Abbotsford {{last night}} with Count Davidoff about eight o'clock. I worked a little this morning, then <b>had</b> a long and warm walk. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton from Chiefswood, the present {{inhabitants}} of Lockhart's cottage, dined with us, which made the society pleasant. He is a fine, soldierly-looking man[292]--though affected with paralysis--his wife a sweet good-humoured little woman. He {{is supposed to be}} a writer in Blackwood's Magazine. Since we were to lose the Lockharts, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> scarce <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more agreeable folks.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1986 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} band's wish that a {{follow-up}} single from the album <b>had</b> been released following [...] "Run Runaway". He said: [...] "We all felt that there should <b>have</b> been a single out {{on the back of}} [...] "Run Runaway". The album was our first big success in America, it was Top 5 all over Europe and Number 1 in Scandinavia for months. Britain was the only place it wasn't a big album. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have,</b> theoretically, <b>had</b> another single off it. It would <b>have</b> been a hit. There was plenty of good stuff on that album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> Hamburg and Leipsic, and Carlsbad and Nuremberg, and Ansbach and Wurzburg! Perhaps this {{is meant}} as a {{compensation}} for our lost youth. But I can't enjoy it as I could when I was young. It's wasted on my sere and yellow leaf. I wish Burnamy and Miss Triscoe were here; I should like to try this garden on them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless my heart!" [...] exclaimed the new arrival, {{grasping}} {{both the}} other's hands with his own. [...] "It's Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I'd find you {{here if you}} were still in existence. Well, well, well!--twenty {{years is a long}} time. The old restaurant's gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?" ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a minute}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the {{illusion}} that he had stolen away, unheard, on the thick mats. But I don’t think that either of us was deceived. The voice returned, stammering words without connection, pausing and faltering, till suddenly steadied it soared into impassioned entreaty, sank to low, harsh tones, voluble, lofty sometimes and sometimes abject. When it paused it left us looking profoundly at each other.|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 2007, Griffin {{said that}} NASA aims {{to put a}} man on Mars by 2037. [...] In an {{interview}} with The Guardian in July 2008 Griffin stated that an opportunity to push on to Mars by extending the Apollo program was squandered by a change in focus to Shuttle and space station programs that only reached orbit: [...] "I spent some time analysing what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done <b>had</b> <b>we</b> used the budgets we received to explore the capabilities inherent in the Apollo hardware after it was built. The short answer is we would <b>have</b> been on Mars 15 or 20 years ago, instead of circling endlessly in low Earth orbit." ...|$|R
60|$|But if on {{this same}} day, 1851 years ago, {{instead of being}} in the great city of Rome, we <b>had</b> been in the little village of Bethlehem in Judaea, we might <b>have</b> seen a sight {{stranger}} still; a sight which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> fancied <b>had</b> anything to do with that merrymaking of the slaves at Rome, and yet which <b>had</b> everything to do with it.|$|R
2500|$|... "I <b>have</b> {{no doubt}} that global—that a trend of global warming exists. I {{am not sure that}} {{it is fair to say}} that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> or ever <b>have</b> <b>had</b> and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, {{those are}} {{important}} items certainly, {{and if we}} had difficulty about it here in a decent sort of country, what might be expected on farther? Well, we have had our outing; I only hope they won't give us up at Irkutsk. I suppose it depends where their grazing-grounds are. There are another two months of summer; I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> our fling till then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is this worth half a column?' He {{shook his}} head. 'No, I'm afraid not. The public doesn't know Pickering. If {{it had been}} Charlie Chaplin or William J. Bryan, or someone on those lines, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the papers {{bringing}} out extras. You can visualize William J. Bryan being bitten in the leg by a monkey. It hits you. But Pickering! Eustace {{might just as well}} have bitten the leg of the table!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't we? It {{was just}} in time for the skating," [...] said Jock. [...] "Only the worst of it is, {{everybody}} will come to the lake, and so mother won't learn to skate. We thought we had found a jolly little place in the wood, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some fun with her, but they found it out, though we halloed as loud as ever we could to keep them off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't call it {{an escape}} at all!" [...] she declared. [...] "I call it the {{greatest}} possible misfortune. If it <b>had</b> been Burnamy <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> brought them together at once, just when she <b>has</b> seen so clearly {{that she was in}} the wrong, and is feeling all broken up. There wouldn't <b>have</b> been any difficulty about his being in the second-cabin. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> contrived to <b>have</b> them meet somehow. If the worst came to the worst you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lent him money to pay the difference, and got him into the first-cabin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the video, Curiel stated, [...] "The {{funny thing}} is, people take us really seriously. We are a serious band, {{but we know}} that, at times, we don't <b>have</b> to take {{ourselves}} so seriously. We <b>have</b> fun. That's why we went ahead and did a video like 'Boom.' We wanted to show people that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> fun. They <b>have</b> a movie out now called Balls of Fury, but we did that same topic back in the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|At that time, {{when the}} Britishers were {{suspicious}} of the [...] "rebels," [...] and General Gage eager to find some cause of complaint whereby he might put in prison those who loved the colony, even a gathering of sixteen lads would not <b>have</b> escaped rigid scrutiny by those who misruled in Boston, and the most imprudent thing <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done, would <b>have</b> been to come together {{in the open air}} where any who passed might see us.|$|R
