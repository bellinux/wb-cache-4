5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E

5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed on an old airport space <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a sound stage. Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help the actor locate his marks.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks.

5|$|The {{two species}} of Seorsumuscardinus are known from {{isolated}} teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, distinguishes the two species, as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, but not in those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, but not in S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living hazel dormouse, which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade.

A slate-roofed, single-level extension {{was added to the}} south prior to 1867. The front ground floor was remodelled sometime between 1900 and 1930, with a doorcase removed and a fascia and cornice added. Later in the 20th century, single-storey extensions were added to the north in the 1960s, and also to the rear (both <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> roofs) and the south, including a uPVC conservatory. The front of the building was also modelled, with a wider front door, fascia sign and plinth added across both the original frontage and the extensions, dividing the architectural features of the ground and first floors. A large amount of the pre-1840 fabric of the building, including first floor joinery, survives into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea is {{a fossil}} genus of {{squirrel}} from the Middle Miocene of France. The single species, L. vireti, is known from three mandibles (lower jaws) and two isolated teeth. All {{come from the}} fissure filling (a fossil deposit formed when a rock fissure filled with sediment) of La Grive L5, part of the La Grive-Saint-Alban complex in Saint-Alban-de-Roche, southeastern France. Lagrivea was a large tree squirrel <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> lower incisors and a large, triangular fourth lower premolar (p4). Each of the four cheekteeth (p4 and three molars, m1 through m3) bears a deep basin {{in the middle of}} the crown. The m3 is about rectangular in shape, but rounded at the back. Although m1 and m2 have two roots, m3 has three.|$|E
5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
50|$|When {{signatures}} <b>with</b> multiple <b>flats</b> {{first came}} in, {{the order of}} the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century. The 16th-century motet Absolon fili mi attributed to Josquin des Prez features two voice parts <b>with</b> two <b>flats,</b> one part <b>with</b> three <b>flats,</b> and one part <b>with</b> four <b>flats.</b>|$|R

5|$|Within Stereospondyli, Yates and Warren erected {{two major}} clades: Capitosauria and Trematosauria. Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> heads and eyes {{near the back}} of the skull. Trematosaurs include a {{diversity}} of temnospondyls, including large marine trematosauroids, aquatic plagiosaurs, brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous, and metoposauroids with eyes near the front of their heads. In 2000, paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls, the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria, and included groups like Lydekkerinidae, Rhytidosteidae, and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used, Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses. Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians, but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms <b>with</b> <b>flat</b> tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
