Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received {{a large amount of}} fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were [...] "everything" [...] to him.|$|E

In 2009 Hebrew University sociologist Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi said {{the fact that it}} has become commonplace for Israelis to move abroad, either permanently or for a stint, makes it contradictory for their families to look down on Diaspora Jews. Haifa University sociologist Oz Almog said in a recent interview: [...] "Ask Israelis now <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Jews coming from countries where they aren't persecuted, like the U.S. and Britain, to live in Israel, and they'll say, 'Those who do are nuts.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a {{sweepstakes}} and uses it to take the whole family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry should know (what he [...] then believes to be) the truth about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse {{at the hands of}} the Dursleys until he witnesses <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Harry and the Wizarding world and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr Weasley is a member of the Order, and accompanies Harry to his visit in the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she [...] "wanted to kill parents", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks's. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Arthur has been promoted to Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.|$|E

Widowers, I thought, are {{generally}} ready enough to marry again; but, no matter <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, they mostly wait a good while, {{for the sake of}} appearances. But this would be different. When a man knows that his wife had selected some one as her successor--and he would be sure to know this, the woman would see to that--he would not feel it necessary to wait. He would be carrying out his dead wife's wishes, and of course in this there should be no delay. Oh, horrible! When I thought of myself as Bernard's dead wife, and that woman living, I actually kicked the stool my feet were resting on. I vowed in my mind the thing should never be. I felt better after I had made this vow, although I had not thought of any way by which I could carry it out. Certainly I was not going to say anything to Bernard about it, one way or another." ...|$|E

This study wants to illustrate how national environmental goals are applied by länsstyrelserna in Sweden. How does the implementation of the environmental goals works by länsstyrelserna in Blekinge, Skåne and Örebro län? Which problems creates obstacles in the implementation of the environmental goals according to länsstyrelserna? What differs between länsstyrelserna in the implementation? Mainly it is the complexity of problems that will be illustrated here, which may result in different implementation sof the environmental goals by länsstyrelserna or that the environmentalgoals do not applys like intended. In this study sixteen national environmentalgoal are examined; “fresh air”. “natural acidification” and “a good settle environment”. This has been done through my theory of implementation and the three criteria of Lennart Lundquist. The material this study is based upon comes from books about implementation and interviews with persons working with the environmental goals by länsstyrelserna I chosen to analyse. Five persons from länsstyrelserna and one person from the council of environmental question have I interviewed, to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the work of the environmental goal. The result shows that länsstyrelserna experience coordinationproblems and lack of resources which creates an obstacle to achieve the environmental goals. Länsstyrelserna describe problems to involve the municipalitys in the environmental work and their important role in the implementation and achieving of the goals. To achieve a successful implementation more resources must be provided as well as information and cooperation. The environmental goals are not implemented in the same way by the länsstyrelserna and this is because of the different in the condition every länsstyrelse dispose over...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid rise}} in {{interest}} in geoengineering the climate {{as a response}} to global warming presents a clear and significant challenge to environmental ethics. The paper articulates what I call the 'presumptive argument' against geoengineering from environmental ethics, a presumption strong enough to make geoengineering almost 'unthinkable' from within that tradition. Two rationales for suspending that presumption are next considered. One of them is a 'lesser evil' argument, the other makes connections between the presumptive argument, ecofacism, and the anthropocentrism/non-anthropocentrism debate. The discussion is designed to prompt reflection on how environmental ethicists should orient themselves to the rapidly moving geoengineering debate and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the moral significance of the earth's large-scale biogeochemical processes compared to the moral significance of individuals, species, and ecosystems.
