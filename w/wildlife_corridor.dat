2500|$|In 1798, the Grand Junction Canal (built by William Jessop) {{from the}} River Thames at Brentford to Berkhamsted was completed; it was {{extended}} to Birmingham in 1805. Castle Wharf (The Port of Berkhamsted), {{on the south side}} of the canal between Ravens Lane and Castle Street, was the centre of the town's canal trade, navigation and boat building activities. It was a hub of the country's inland water transport system, linking the ports and industrial centres of the country. Main activities included the transport of coal, grain, building materials and manure. Timber yards, boating wharves, breweries, boat building and chemical works flourished as a result of the canal, with over 700workers employed locally. It is still known as the [...] "Port of Berkhamsted". Separately, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (the [...] "Canal Duke" [...] and [...] "father of the inland waterway system"), lived in Ashridge, near Berkhamsted. The canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929.

2500|$|South Pond is {{the second}} oldest {{structure}} in Midhurst, second only to St. Ann's Castle: it {{is thought to have}} been dammed in the early 12th century as a fish-pond for the Castle. [...] To the west the South Mill was in existence by 1284, and used initially to grind corn. In 1634 it was converted to a fulling mill, and in the mid-1800s it was converted again to leather production. The pond is prone to silting due to its underlying greensand geology, and has in recent years become polluted and lifeless, in large part due to over-population of ducks as a result of artificial feeding. The South Pond Group was established in 2012 to conserve and develop the area around the South Pond as a <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridor.</b> [...] Activities include clearance parties, water quality monitoring, newsletters, talks and maintaining notice and interpretation boards. [...] Major renovation works, involving dredging and establishing reed and waterplant beds to reconstitute the natural ecology, capable of supporting a full range of pond life, were undertaken in 2014– 2015, under the leadership of the South Pond Group with community support.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wildlife</b> <b>corridors</b> {{can help}} {{maintain}} landscape connectivity but novel methods {{must be developed}} to assess regional structural connectivity quickly and cheaply so as to determine where expensive and time-consuming surveys of functional connectivity should occur. We use least-cost methods, the most accurate and up-to-date land conversion dataset for East Africa, and interview data on <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridors,</b> to develop a single, consistent methodology to systematically assess <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridors</b> at a national scale using Tanzania as a case study. Our research aimed {{to answer the following}} questions; (i) which corridors may still remain open (i. e. structurally connected) at a national scale, (ii) which have been potentially severed by anthropogenic land conversion (e. g., agriculture and settlements), (iii) where are other remaining potential <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridors</b> located, and (iv) which protected areas with lower forms of protection (e. g., Forest Reserves and Wildlife Management Areas) may act as stepping-stones linking more than one National Park and/or Game Reserve. We identify a total of 52 structural connections between protected areas that are potentially open to wildlife movement, and in so doing add 23 to those initially identified by other methods in Tanzanian Government reports. We find {{that the vast majority of}} corridors noted in earlier reports as "likely to be severed" have actually not been cut structurally (21 of 24). Nonetheless, nearly a sixth of all the <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridors</b> identified in Tanzania in 2009 have potentially been separated by land conversion, and a third now pass across lands likely to be converted to human use in the near future. Our study uncovers two reserves with lower forms of protection (Uvinza Forest Reserve in the west and Wami-Mbiki Wildlife Management Area in the east) that act as apparently crucial stepping-stones between National Parks and/or Game Reserves and therefore require far more serious conservation support. Methods used in this study are readily applicable to other nations lacking detailed data on wildlife movements and plagued by inaccurate land cover datasets. Our results are the first step in identifying <b>wildlife</b> <b>corridors</b> at a regional scale and provide a springboard for ground-based follow-up conservation...|$|R
