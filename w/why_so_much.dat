5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining <b>why</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

25|$|The Department of Justice {{decision}} to not prosecute Presser prompted members of Congress {{to investigate the}} handling of the politically sensitive case. Some congressmen were concerned that Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration had led to favorable treatment, while others wanted to know <b>why</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time and so many resources had been expended when DOJ had no intention of prosecuting Presser. Additionally, many members of Congress had spent years telling voters that the Teamsters were corrupt, and now voters were demanding an answer as to why Presser was not being called to account. DOJ defended its actions by pointing to Presser's long-time role as a criminal informant, but members of Congress were unhappy that DOJ seemed willing tolerate corruption in the nation's largest labor movement. Senators William V. Roth, Jr. (R-Delaware) and Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) ordered the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) to look into {{the handling of the}} case, and Senator Joe Biden (D-Delaware) asked the Judiciary Committee to probe the matter. The PSI quickly asked the FBI, DOJ and DOL to turn over their files on the Presser probe.|$|E

When Stone was asked <b>why</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of an emphasis has been placed on the Holocaust, as opposed to the 20-plus million casualties the Soviet Union, for example, suffered in World War II, he stated that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was an overly powerful Jewish lobby within the U.S. The remarks were heavily criticized by Jewish groups, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center.|$|E

It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's <b>why</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|Stagg {{addresses}} {{the question of}} <b>why</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the Christian Household Code is found in what is generally recognized as the Pauline tradition. He points to a seeming irony that the Code in the New Testament {{is associated with the}} apostle who fought so openly and suffered such personal sacrifice for both freedom and equity for Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. Citing the complexities with which Paul had to deal after his historic proclamation in Galatians 3:28, Stagg concludes that the New Testament Household Code was not a simple situation in which one man [...] "single-handedly imposed male chauvinism on Gentile churches." [...] He suggests that Paul's strong emphases stemmed from the [...] "perennial tension between freedom and order." [...] Pointing out that freedom is ever at the risk of its abuse in terms of permissiveness, disorder, anarchy, or chaos, [...] "the twin threats of legalism and libertinism are ancient and recurrent". Stagg notes that various New Testament books reflect [...] "this ongoing struggle for a proper relationship between law and grace, gift and demand, freedom and responsibility". He conjectures that this situation must have become acute in the early churches, especially among women and slaves who had suffered most under the heaviest restraints. Therefore, they understandably would want {{to make the most of}} their new freedom [...] "in Christ", and Stagg concludes that Paul found himself at the center of the battle.|$|E
