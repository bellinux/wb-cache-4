40|$|Aim of the study: To {{investigate}} {{the possibilities of}} planning, succession and development of aid for adolescents in Kaunas city <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. Objectives: 1. to define the main stages in providing help for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide; 2. to clarify interdepartmental obstacles providing help for adolescents in crisis; 3. to formulate recommendations {{for the development of}} aid for adolescents in Kaunas <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. Methods: Qualitative, descriptive analysis. Information was gathered using semi-structured interview method. There were questioned 21 respondents from institutions involving four Lithuanian systems that provide aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide: Social Security, Health Service, Educational and Interior. Questions were related to suicide prevention, intervention and postvention. Results: Main stages in providing aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide were defined: detecting a child <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> or is at risk of committing suicide, providing urgent aid, and providing continued aid. Vacancies were detected in all stages of providing aid. Representatives from all the institutions that provide aid <b>to</b> adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide agree {{that there is a need}} of interdepartmental cooperation in Lithuania, though the results of the analysis show that such cooperation has still been weakly developed. Three main obstacles in interdepartmental cooperation have been defined: 1. conditioned by the child in crisis and his/her kin; 2. related to detecting the child in crisis and providing the proper aid; 3. arising from directing children and youth to other departments. Obstacles conditioned by a child in crisis and his kin are usually faced by juvenile inspectors, family doctors, and school psychologists. Mostly juvenile inspectors and health professionals lack knowledge in treating adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. Perhaps the biggest obstacle related to detecting a child in crisis and providing appropriate aid is confidentiality as well as absence of feedback and negative attitude of institutions towards professionals of other institutions. Conclusions: 1. The services provided by medical, educational, legal safety and social institutions for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide in Kaunas city include detecting children at risk for suicide, urgent medical aid, continued treatment, and psychological, social rehabilitation. 2. The main obstacles in interdepartmental cooperation among institutions providing aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide are imperfection of legal aid succession and cooperation, problems in segmentation of information, feedback and confidentiality, unfriendly attitudes of professionals and public towards aid and insufficient knowledge of suicide prevention. 3. In order to carry the prevention of youth suicide more effectively it is essential to develop the cooperation system among institutions that face adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide, educate public and professionals who provide aid, motivate family care of their children...|$|R

One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, who ended his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> break up a fight.

All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> protect his neighbours.

5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of the victims were mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries.

For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication.

5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> regain their former territories.|$|E

5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police.

After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he started to extract vengeance on those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep him in exile. He exiled Rajrajeshhwori to Helambu, where she became a Buddhist nun, on the charge of siding with Damodar Pande and colluding with the British. Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, were executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Rana Bahadur also punished those who did not help him while in exile. Among them was Prithvipal Sen, the king of Palpa, who was tricked into imprisonment, while his kingdom forcefully annexed. Subarnaprabha and her supporters were released and given a general pardon. Those who had helped Rana Bahadur to return to Kathmandu were lavished with rank, land, and wealth. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second kaji; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen's brother, was made the mul kaji; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur's half-brother, was made the mul chautariya; while Rangnath Paudel was made the raj guru (royal spiritual preceptor).|$|E
