5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used <b>where</b> <b>no</b> cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives, razors, swords, and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs, including those used in clocks and watches.|$|E

The following battle honours were awarded to the British Commandos for service in the Second World War (** indicates <b>where</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Commando were present).|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization.

5|$|A {{significant}} and growing {{proportion of the}} collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 70 (I-70) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States, {{stretching}} from Cove Fort, Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland. In Colorado, the highway traverses an east–west route across {{the center of}} the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the Great Plains, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited on Interstate Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies <b>where</b> <b>no</b> other through route exists.|$|E

5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} {{occurs on}} a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> adatom traps or sources are present. This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy, wherein the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses.

5|$|Manstein's plan, {{developed}} with the informal cooperation of Heinz Guderian, {{suggested that the}} Panzer divisions attack through the wooded hills of the Ardennes <b>where</b> <b>no</b> one would expect them, then establish bridgeheads on the River Meuse and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Wehrmacht would thus cut off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. This {{part of the plan}} later became known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut"). Manstein's proposal also included a second thrust outflanking the Maginot Line, which would allow the Wehrmacht to force any future defensive line much further south.|$|E
5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> one could be convinced {{to enforce the law}} or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E

5|$|Retrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, {{were added}} in the mid-1990s. These awards are given by Worldcons held 50, 75, or 100 years after a Worldcon <b>where</b> <b>no</b> Hugos had been awarded, which were the {{conventions}} in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954, and are given for works {{that would have been}} eligible in that year, by the same process as the regular Hugos. Retro Hugos have only been given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The six Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award them. The next opportunity will be in 2022 for 1947.|$|E
5|$|Shafi'i {{accepted}} {{cases in}} which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted istidlal or inference, a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case <b>where</b> <b>no</b> clear precedent could be found. In this case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for legislation.|$|E
5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns <b>where</b> <b>no</b> alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 edition was {{the only}} tournament <b>where</b> <b>no</b> five-wicket hauls were taken, while the 2003 tournament had a record 12 five-wicket hauls taken by 11 {{different}} bowlers. Five bowlers—Gilmour, Ashantha de Mel, Glenn McGrath, Vasbert Drakes and Shahid Afridi—have performed this feat twice {{in the history of}} the tournament. McGrath {{was the only}} bowler to take a five-wicket haul in more than one World Cup. His 7 wickets for 15 runs against Namibia remains the best bowling figures by a bowler {{in the history of the}} tournament. The most recent five- wicket haul was taken by Australia cricketer Mitchell Starc in the 2015 World Cup; he took 6 wickets for 28 runs against New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity, which is usually subdivided into four separate volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps <b>where</b> <b>no</b> recent volcanic activity has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern Volcanic Zones has been moving northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{constitution}} and legislation provides for regular {{elections for the}} office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. A majority vote is required to win. A runoff election round is held in cases <b>where</b> <b>no</b> candidate secures the majority {{in the first round of}} voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the {{constitution and}} dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.|$|E
