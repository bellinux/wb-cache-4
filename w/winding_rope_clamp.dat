5000|$|Edward Ormerod {{developed}} and patented the [...] "Ormerod" [...] safety link or detaching hook, known in mining circles as a [...] "butterfly". This elegant device was {{inserted into the}} <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> {{in such a way}} that if the lift cage was accidentally overwound the link would be pulled into a bell through which the <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> passed. This action would not only disconnect the cage from the <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> but also prevent the cage from falling back down the shaft. The device was patented in 1867 and is manufactured today. It is believed that the lives of many miners have been saved by its use and it has never failed in service.|$|R

40|$|The Nicaraguan <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump avoids {{a number}} of the {{technical}} complications in-herent to the classical windpump, especially the starting problem and the occurence of dynamic peak loads. The <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump starts smoothly and can achieve system e-ciencies comparable to the piston pump. As a result, the rotor and the tower can be very lightweight, resulting in signicantly lower production and installation costs than for a classical windmill (typically 25 - 35 %). This opens up a new market of wind pump users, e. g. small farmers. The present paper gives a description of the <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump system using a stationary approach. Expressions are derived for the system eciency and long-term output of the wind pump in a Weibull wind regime. It is shown that a properly maintained <b>wind</b> <b>rope</b> pump can have a higher output and better availability than a classical wind pump; typically a higher matching ratio would be used (xd 1 : 4). The use of the device in Nicaragua, however, seems not to optimize the average water output. The question therefore arises whether the critical design parameters, i. e. the design pump speed, rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} of end connections for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene 12 -strand braided rope (synthetic rope) for use in timber harvesting applications. Fourteen different end connections for 14 mm and 16 mm diameter synthetic rope were developed and break tested to determine suitability. Three types of end connections were evaluated: spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. End connections with adhesive had variable strength performance and are therefore not recommended. Within the dry hardware group, the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strengths. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, <b>rope</b> <b>clamps,</b> knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and in limited applications, <b>rope</b> <b>clamps.</b> Further research and development is needed on these six concepts with larger sample sizes and under testing and operating varied conditions...|$|R

50|$|A wire <b>rope</b> <b>clamp,</b> {{also called}} a clip, {{is used to}} fix the loose end of the loop back to the wire rope. It usually {{consists}} of a U-shaped bolt, a forged saddle, and two nuts. The two layers of wire rope are placed in the U-bolt. The saddle is then fitted over the ropes on to the bolt (the saddle includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The nuts secure the arrangement in place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a 2 in diameter rope.|$|R
50|$|Endless <b>winding</b> <b>rope</b> {{is made by}} winding single {{strands of}} {{high-performance}} yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached.

The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake.|$|R

Friction force is in its highest intensity when the rope passes from one layer to another, if the <b>winding</b> of the <b>rope</b> is multilayered.

40|$|Friction {{and wear}} {{behavior}} exists between hoisting ropes that are wound around the drums of a multi-layer winding hoist. It decreases the service life of ropes and threatens mine safety. In this research, {{a series of}} experiments were conducted using a self-made test rig to {{study the effects of}} the strand lay direction and crossing angle on the <b>winding</b> <b>rope’s</b> tribological behavior. Results show that the friction coefficient in the steady-state period shows a decreasing tendency with an increase of the crossing angle in both cross directions, but the variation range is different under different cross directions. Using thermal imaging, the high temperature regions always distribute along the strand lay direction in the gap between adjacent strands, as the cross direction is the same with the strand lay direction (right cross contact). Additionally, the temperature rise in the steady-state increases with the increase of the crossing angle in both cross directions. The differences of the wear scar morphology are obvious under different cross directions, especially for the large crossing angle tests. In the case of right cross, the variation range of wear mass loss is larger than that in left cross. The damage that forms on the wear surface is mainly ploughing, pits, plastic deformation, and fatigue fracture. The major wear mechanisms are adhesive wear, and abrasive and fatigue wear...|$|R
