Brazilian universities now have the capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with them to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
500|$|Alec Hanley Bemis of LA Weekly highly criticized Spears and {{the music}} video. He thought that the singer's [...] "lack of musical talent" [...] had begun to affect her career, after Dark was {{selected}} {{as the director of the}} video. Bemis commented, however, that Spears' already had [...] "a history of questionable decisions", and cited her Rolling Stone photoshoot done in early 1999, which was condemned by the American Family Association, as an example. [...] He continued to state that the plotline set the singer [...] "on the fast track to adulthood" [...] and questioned, [...] "who's in bed with Britney now? While a TV tabloid recently reported that an old bayou beau in Louisiana has mother Spears’ approval, fantasizing fans want to believe Britney‘s dallying with that braided moppet from N’Sync or a member of the Backstreet Boys. But the only verifiable fact <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with is that Spears has started running with a darker L.A. crowd." [...] Bemis finished his review saying that [...] "no avant-garde film techniques [...] But Britney's lips glisten so... Speaking frankly, this light in our lives hurts us, from the fire in our loins to the bottom of our broken hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 22, 2007, it was {{revealed}} that The Postal Service had begun work on a new album, though the specifics of the production and the release date were vague. [...] Gibbard stated, [...] "We're slowly starting. We're crawling right now, and whether that crawl turns into a walk remains to be seen. But we'll know more {{towards the end of the}} year. I've just been touring so much and trying to find time to make it happen and make our schedules line up." [...] Tamborello added, [...] "We're talking about wanting to finish an album by sometime next year, because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Death Cab's schedule and stuff.

2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore will ever get to an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on the side of caution and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E

There are four sixteen pounders, four twelves, and the pivot; so that gives three men to a gun, besides {{officers}} and idlers.

I suppose one does not talk so much about these things over here, and I dare say you have so much to occupy your mind you don't talk of us in England." [...] With the quickness of a refined perception she saw a slight shade in his face, and changed the subject.

No! you Americans take people on their 'face value,' as my brother Reggy says, and we always want to know what are the 'securities.' And then American men are more gallant, though," [...] she declared mischievously, [...] "I think you are an exception in that way. Indeed," [...] she went on, [...] "the more I see of your countrymen the less you seem like them. You are more like us,--more like an Englishman--indeed, more like an Englishman than most Englishmen,--I mean in the matter of reserve and all that sort of thing, you know. It's odd,--isn't it?
