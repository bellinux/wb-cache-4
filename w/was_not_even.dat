5|$|The {{publication}} of A Voyage Round the World brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe. The respectable Royal Society {{made him a}} member on January 9, 1777, though he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> 23 years old. He was granted similar titles from academies ranging from Berlin to Madrid. These appointments, however, were unpaid.|$|E
5|$|As Japan {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network {{had been reduced to}} air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> measured anymore.|$|E

50|$|This latter {{statement}} can {{be proven}} as follows. Suppose x <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b> Then x <b>is</b> odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence x² = x·x is odd. Thus x² <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R
50|$|To prove: If x² is even, then x is even.Although {{a direct}} proof can be given, {{we choose to}} prove this {{statement}} by contraposition. The contrapositive of the above statement is::If x <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even,</b> then x² <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, Italian {{director}} Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Ossessione (1943), regarded both {{as one of}} {{the great}} noirs and a seminal film in the development of neorealism. (This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French Le Dernier Tournant in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including Drunken Angel (1948), Stray Dog (1949), The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and High and Low (1963).|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|My {{conclusion}} is, accordingly, {{that there}} is no evidence whatever for the much-quoted salute of the gladiators. The only two ancient references, those in Suetonius and in Dio, refer not to gladiators but to naumachiarii, men condemned to die, and even these references are to one specific episode, the circumstances of which indicate that the supposed salute <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> a regular salute of the naumachiarii.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) {{selected}} Don Carlos of Spain, {{the elder}} child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir (with {{no mention of}} Anna Maria Luisa). By 1722, the Electress <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo {{was reduced to a}} spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future. In the midst of this, Marguerite Louise, Anna Maria Luisa's mother, died. Instead of willing her valuables to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement, they went to the Princess of Epinoy, a distant relative.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 NFL Network program “10 Worst Teams of All Time” (produced {{prior to}} the Lions’ winless season) {{recognized}} the 1976 Buccaneers as the worst NFL team ever, although it is disputed whether their record was not deceptive, as they were decimated by injuries and were a play away from victory several times. There is some opinion that the 1976 team <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> the worst in Buccaneers history, with the 2–14 1986 squad deserving of that distinction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the heavy}} 4–1 {{defeat in the}} {{previous}} Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder {{was one of the}} three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted him off. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history.|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a major problem, and the English version of the screenplay <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In May 1716, the Emperor {{assured the}} Electress and the Grand Duke {{that there was}} no insurmountable {{obstacle}} preventing her accession, but that Austria and Tuscany must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house which was to succeed the Medici. As an incentive to accelerate Cosimo's reply, the Emperor hinted that Tuscany would reap territorial advancements. In June 1717 Cosimo declared his wish that the House of Este should succeed. Charles VI's promises never materialised. In 1718 he repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union between Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Don Carlos of Spain, the eldest child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir. By 1722 the Electress <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo was reduced to spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the demolition of the wall.|$|E

Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country.

5|$|The idea of {{subjecting}} {{the heavy}} water facility at Vemork to heavy air bombing surfaced, but Tronstad was a staunch opponent {{of such an}} idea, which he saw as too hazardous.

The first attempt to take out the facility, in November 1942, had consisted of British personnel using gliders to land near Vemork. The operation, codenamed Freshman, was a catastrophe, as all units except for one towing aircraft perished, either due to crash landings or in German captivity.|$|E
