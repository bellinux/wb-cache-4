2500|$|The white-fronted {{capuchin}} frequently {{travels with}} the common squirrel monkey {{and at other times}} with the tufted capuchin and Venezuelan red howler. The double-toothed kite often accompanies these monkeys, exactly as it does other species of primates. The white-fronted capuchin feels threatened by avian predators, and it is very vigilant around any large bird of prey. In Vichada, Colombia, tayra, Boa constrictor and the ornate hawk-eagle have been seen trying to capture the monkey. After detecting the tayra and Boa constrictor the members of the troop showed little fear and caution, even though these animals threatened the monkeys. The most common behavior after detecting a potential ground predator is [...] "ya-ya" [...] vocalization and branch breaking over the head of the potential predator, similar to the display of the brown <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey.</b> In contrast, after being frightened by a male ornate hawk-eagle the monkeys screamed intensely only once, then hid quietly, some descending to the ground to sneak away.|$|E

50|$|Theories abound {{about the}} {{evolution}} of the atelines; one theory is they are most closely related to the <b>woolly</b> spider <b>monkeys</b> (Bractyteles), and most likely split from such <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> as (Lagothrix and Oreonax) in the South American lowland forest, to evolve their unique locomotory system. This theory is not supported by fossil evidence. Other theories include Brachyteles, Lagothrix and Ateles in an unresolved trichotomy, and two clades, one composed of Ateles and Lagothrix and the other of Alouatta and Brachyteles. More recent molecular evidence suggests the Atelinae split in the middle to late Miocene (13 Ma), separating spider <b>monkeys</b> from the <b>woolly</b> spider <b>monkeys</b> and the <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys.</b>|$|R

50|$|The gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> (Lagothrix cana) is a <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> {{species from}} South America. It {{is found in}} Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Lagothrix cana gets its common name, gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey,</b> from its thick gray coat. Its hands, feet, face and {{the inside of the}} arms are dark in color. Two {{subspecies}} of Lagothrix cana are known: L. c. cana and L. c. tschudii. L. c. cana is found in both Brazil and Peru and L. c. tschudii is found only in southeastern Peru. An isolated population was discovered by Wallace and Painter in the Madidi National Park in Bolivia. This population is distinctively darker and could soon be a new subspecies. The gray <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> has been considered endangered by IUCN since 2008. The species is listed as endangered because the it suffered a 50% decrease in population over the past 45 years due to deforestation and hunting.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> (Oreonax flavicauda) is a New World monkey {{endemic to}} Peru.

The yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> was at first under the Lagothrix genus along with other woolly monkeys, but due to debatable primary sources, they {{have been placed in}} Oreonax. Oreonax has been proposed to be a subgenus of Lagothrix, but others have acknowledged it to be a full genus. A recent extensive study proves that the yellow-tailed <b>woolly</b> <b>monkey</b> may indeed be in Lagothrix.|$|E

40|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Lagothrix sp.) are {{threatened}} species and numerous zoos {{have failed to}} sustain successful populations. The most common causes of death in captive <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are related to pregnancy and hypertension. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate serum concentrations {{of a large number}} of captive <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> to establish baseline means and compare these concentrations with their closest related species to determine potential abnormalities. Serum analyses from 30 <b>woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> housed at two institutions (Apenheul, The Netherlands and The Louisville Zoo, KY, USA) over 12 yr were collected. The statistical model included gender, age group (young, 0 - 4 yr of age; middle, 5 - 9 yr; and old, 10 + yr), and zoological institution. All panel result means were similar to previously reported concentrations for howler (Alouatta sp.) and spider monkeys (Ateles sp.) with the possible exception of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl-transferase being higher, whereas creatinine and phosphorus were lower. The serum glucose mean of 6. 7 mmol/L is above the baseline range for humans and spider monkeys. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase, and sodium (Na) were higher in females and magnesium (Mg) was higher in males (P < 0. 05). ALP, Mg, and phosphorus were highest (...|$|R

50|$|<b>Woolly</b> <b>monkeys</b> are hunted by {{a variety}} of species of eagles and cats, such as the jaguar.
