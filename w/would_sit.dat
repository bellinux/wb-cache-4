5|$|The Eisenhowers (especially Dwight in the beginning) {{spent most}} of their time in a glass-covered porch {{overlooking}} Seminary Ridge. Reading and playing cards with friends were popular pastimes on the porch, it was said that he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> for hours reflecting on his life and legacy.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran {{along the length of}} the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> while they examine the merchandise.|$|E

5|$|On March 1, {{the team}} {{announced}} that LeVert <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> out {{the remainder of}} the season to concentrate on his continued recovery after suffering a lower left leg injury at the end of December. On March 5, Michigan lost to (#15/#16) Iowa, 61–71, in their Big Ten Conference finale, to finish the regular season at 20–11 (11–8 Big Ten). Prior to the game for senior night, Michigan celebrated the accomplishments and careers of seniors Spike Albrecht and Caris LeVert, whose senior seasons were both cut short due to injuries. Freshman Fred Wright-Jones, who has been a manager and practice player the entire season, was allowed to suit up for the game.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome {{is dark and}} {{cavernous}} and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} ambassador {{reported that}} {{in the presence of}} guests, Henry <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king {{to spend more time with}} Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E

5|$|There {{were other}} {{financial}} pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E
5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new vice-president, since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new vice-president <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a vice-president from a member of the Congress of the Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, {{service in the}} army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E

5|$|Both Walt Disney Pictures and DreamWorks {{bid for the}} US {{distribution}} rights. Eventually, Disney won {{the rights}} to dub the English adaptation of Spirited Away, {{under the supervision of}} Pixar animator John Lasseter. A Miyazaki fan, Lasseter <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with Spirited Away, which impressed Lasseter. Upon hearing his reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he would be interested in trying to bring Spirited Away to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be executive producer for English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away respectively. Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E
5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
5|$|The player <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> at {{the stand}} and press the buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|In {{the charter}} of the Presidential Council, each of the three leaders <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> on a Presidential Council which would be tasked with {{approving}} all major policy decisions of the country. At the same time, each would get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks of managing the military and civil service in the country. The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders; however, the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president. It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972, followed by Ahomadégbé until 1974, and then Apithy until 1976. One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on 7 May 1972. However, stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine Ahomadégbé's ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu Kérékou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991.|$|E
5|$|Maria made an {{agreement}} with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with this, Maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for the latter family, {{she fell in love}} with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician. His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them. Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2015, Albrecht {{announced}} he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> {{out the rest}} of the season for the 2015–16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|R
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There was also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot. Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment which collected airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E
