500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up to the point where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> erect".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to {{take a good look at}} one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

2500|$|... "Heck, {{people were}} talking about it in spring training. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> around the outfield one day and {{everyone}} {{was concerned about the}} stadium being cursed because it was built on an ancient Indian burial ground. We were going to go get an exorcist or a Catholic priest or something {{to get rid of the}} curse. I'm like, [...] "I don't want to be on an Indian burial ground." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> on {{the front}} porch, close to each other, and I think we were holding each other's hands, when Mrs. Carson came back. As she {{approached}} she looked at us inquiringly, plainly wishing to know why <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> side by side before her door {{as if we had}} some special object in so doing.|$|E
60|$|She {{had raised}} herself from her couch, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> face to face.|$|E
6000|$|... "And the North Star ahead {{almost over}} your {{starboard}} bow means that we're steering a course, north, northwest, or maybe north by west, for I doubt if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{more than ten}} degrees westward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Trefusis, {{extending}} his hand--Erskine at first {{thought for a}} hearty shake--"give me half-a-crown towards the cost of our expedition here to-day to assert {{the right of the}} people to tread the soil <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> upon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Einstein's initial reply:"Most honorable Mr. Moffat: Our {{situation}} <b>is</b> the following. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{in front}} of a closed box which we cannot open, and we try hard to discuss what is inside and what is not," [...] Einstein replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} here to refresh myself," [...] she said to Mackinnon one evening--to Mackinnon and myself; for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> together.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{before the}} fire-place. He left me, {{and walked away}} slowly with his head down, {{apparently}} intending to leave the room.|$|E
60|$|We {{waited to}} give him time to cross the hall and drive away. The Count {{approached}} us while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> near the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those were trees!" [...] he said. [...] "That panel's {{over four}} feet across, I {{measured}} it once. I dare say the pine {{it was cut}} from grew right where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing,</b> before the land was cleared to build the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. At {{first sight}} I {{should say that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the lip of}} a crater of some vast extinct volcano. Look how it curves to north and south and at the slope running down to the lake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, maybe. But {{you come}} on! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> {{out for a}} walk, and here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> stock-still {{in the middle of}} the {{sidewalk}} with folks all around us. Come on! If you don't come I will leave you;" [...] and Nellie started on, dragging Tom with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I do not know," [...] she answered, so tremulously {{that the}} words {{scarcely}} reached us, though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{only a few feet}} away.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed much}} as if fortune {{had at last}} consented to smile upon us, for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{directly}} in front of the great man.|$|E
6000|$|... "What does it mean, Macumazahn?" [...] she asked, {{when the}} pair had gone by, as they thought unobserved, since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{where they could}} not see us.|$|E
6000|$|SHE [jumping up distractedly] If you {{say that}} again I shall do {{something}} I'll be sorry for. Here <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>standing</b> {{on the edge of}} a frightful precipice. No doubt it's quite simple to go over and have done with it. But can't you suggest anything more agreeable? ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> at {{latitude}} φ1, longitude zero; {{we want to}} {{find the}} azimuth from our viewpoint to Point 2 at latitude φ2, longitude L (positive eastward).

6000|$|... "Silly way {{of putting}} it, I know," [...] said Father Brown apologetically. [...] "Sounds like a fairy tale. But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant's club, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the earth. He was broken against this green bank <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> by {{the great}} marble fireplace, and Canaples was resting one of his feet upon the huge brass andirons. He made a gesture of impatience as I spoke.|$|E
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} twenty minutes later, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{together}} {{at the edge of}} the woods. She wanted me to come to the house to take breakfast with them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it you, Checco?' we whispered, for {{the guard}} {{of the gate}} might have heard us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> in a little plot of waste ground, ten yards from the walls.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{say that}} we have done so; but we may; for human nature is just the same now as it was then; and {{therefore}} it is as well for us to look round--at least once now and then, and see whether <b>we</b> too <b>are</b> in danger of falling, while we think that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> safe.|$|R
60|$|MR. A. Will {{you take}} my word, dear child--the word {{of one who}} can dare humbly to say he has proved it, {{so as to be}} as sure as of the floor <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on, that that Rock exists; and God grant that you may, in prayer and patience, be brought to rest on it once more.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> hadn't <b>been</b> <b>standing</b> {{around the}} stove in the dining-room {{more than ten}} minutes, before the purser came hurrying toward us.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> {{apart from}} the others, and she was sipping a cup of spiced wine that the host had mulled for her. She {{looked at me with}} a {{tolerant}} smile.|$|E
60|$|Paul was of {{the same}} opinion, even {{going so far as}} to declare that he had noted on coming ashore the gum tree which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> near while holding the consultation.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} lose all {{patience}} with me. She snatched the book out of my hand, and opened it before me on the table by which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> side by side.|$|E
5000|$|... "They {{told us we}} wouldn't get here. And {{there were}} those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies, (Well. Yes, sir. Talk) but all the world today knows that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying, [...] "We ain't goin' let nobody turn us around."

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> {{high above}} {{the ground in the}} loggia into which our apartments open, and I point across the soft haze of the public gardens to a tall white mass of University {{buildings}} that rises with a free and fearless gesture, to lift saluting pinnacles against the clear evening sky.

5000|$|This is the Golden Age {{of which}} the prophets prophesied and {{of which the}} Psalmist sang; {{and it is the}} {{privilege}} of the student of the divine Word today, by the eye of faith, to see that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> at the very portals of that blessed time!
