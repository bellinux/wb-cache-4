[...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice.

[...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E

500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered or the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E
