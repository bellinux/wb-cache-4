5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E

25|$|After World War II {{he became}} a leading {{exponent}} of <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Orwell termed “neo-toryism”, regarding the maintenance of British imperial power as an invaluable bulwark against Communism and as being indispensable to the creation and continuation of international peace and political stability.|$|E

2500|$|The Tour de France {{appealed from}} the start {{not just for the}} {{distance}} and its demands but because it played to a wish for national unity, a call to what Maurice Barrès called the France [...] "of earth and deaths" [...] or <b>what</b> <b>Georges</b> Vigarello called [...] "the image of a France united by its earth." ...|$|R
500|$|Stockwell Day {{called a}} new Canadian Alliance {{leadership}} race for 2002, and soon declared himself a candidate. Harper emerged as Day's main rival, and declared his own candidacy on December 3, 2001. He eventually won {{the support of}} at least 28 Alliance MPs, including Scott Reid, James Rajotte and Keith Martin. During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with Quebecois nationalists, and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec. He argued that [...] "the French language is not imperilled in Quebec", and opposed [...] "special status" [...] for the province in the Canadian Constitution accordingly. He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare, {{and said that he}} would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives {{as long as they were}} led by Joe Clark. On social issues, Harper argued for [...] "parental rights" [...] to use corporal punishment against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent. He described his potential support base as [...] "similar to <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Bush tapped".|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the SG-1 writers wondering for years <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was [...] "A Day in the Life of General O'Neill", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt [...] "Zero Hour" [...] was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit {{at the end of}} the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the emergency lighting goes off. He achieved depth by using differently-colored lights in the control room and near the gate.|$|E
500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's <b>what</b> <b>George</b> is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his study}} of Slavic cosmology, Jiří Dynda (2014), {{identifies}} Triglav as a conception of the axis mundi, and compares it to similar concepts from other Indo-European cultures. He gives weight to the Triglav as a representation of <b>what</b> <b>Georges</b> Dumézil studied as the [...] "Indo-European trifunctional hypothesis" [...] (holy, martial and economic functions reflected by three human types and social classes).|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{like her}} father, old Cheriton. I knew {{him at the}} club--one of the old sort of squires; married his second wife at sixty and buried her at eighty. Old 'Claret and Piquet,' they called him; had more {{children}} under the rose than any man in Devonshire. I saw him playing half-crown points the week before he died. It's in the blood. <b>What's</b> <b>George's</b> weight?--ah, ha!" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk about it with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to <b>what</b> <b>George</b> actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E
2500|$|A. J. Liebling said on him, [...] " [...] {{about as}} subtle {{as a house}} falling in. He makes {{too much of the}} failure of {{newspapers}} to print exactly <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Seldes would have printed if he were the managing editor. But he is a useful citizen. In fact is a fine little gadfly, representing an enormous effort for one man and his wife".|$|E
2500|$|US President Barack Obama {{said that}} the {{agreement}} {{would need to be}} built on in the future and that [...] "We've come a long way but we have much further to go." [...] Gregg Easterbrook noted that Obama's speech was exactly <b>what</b> <b>George</b> H W Bush had said after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. However, there had been no progress in regulating greenhouse gases since 1992.|$|E

2500|$|The medieval church {{underwent}} many alterations {{before its}} demolition {{in the early}} 19th century. Small shops were built against its walls, St Dunstan's Churchyard becoming a centre for bookselling and publishing. Later repairs were carried out in an Italianate style: rusticated stonework was used, {{and some of the}} Gothic windows were replaced with round headed ones, resulting in <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Godwin called [...] "a most heterogeneous appearance". In 1701 the church's old vaulted roof was replaced with a flat ceiling, ornamented with recessed panels.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{has also}} had a {{considerable}} influence on 20th-century literature. Figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, David Lodge, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike. <b>What</b> <b>George</b> Henry Price wrote in his 1963 book The Narrow Pass regarding the [...] "who" [...] and the [...] "what" [...] of Kierkegaard still seems to hold true today: [...] "Kierkegaard was the sanest man of his generation....Kierkegaard was a schizophrenic....Kierkegaard was the greatest Dane....the difficult Dane....the gloomy Dane...Kierkegaard was the greatest Christian of the century....Kierkegaard's aim was {{the destruction of the}} historic Christian faith....He did not attack philosophy as such....He negated reason....He was a voluntarist....Kierkegaard was the Knight of Faith....Kierkegaard never found faith....Kierkegaard possessed the truth....Kierkegaard was one of the damned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some had {{wondered}} if Tiner's liberal newspaper editorials had cost him potential {{votes in the}} congressional race. Tiner {{said that he had}} not expected his editorials to become a campaign issue. When the editorials became part of the campaign, Tiner called himself [...] "a conservative with a heart", a designation like <b>what</b> <b>George</b> W. Bush would late dub as [...] "compassionate conservatism". When Tiner was questioned about a change in his position to support navigation of the Red River and American aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, he said that the previous opposition to both proposals came from the Shreveport Journal editorial board, not himself: [...] "The Shreveport Journal is not running for Congress. ... I'm coming out from behind the printing press ... two years from now the {{people will be able to}} see what I am." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was {{obvious to me that}} it badly needed pepping up. I told them to bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By the time it was brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record <b>what</b> <b>George</b> Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let me try it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E

After George expressed his opinion, James asked <b>George</b> <b>what</b> he should do. The result was a reverse engineering project which stripped the songs down. Most of the tracks were completely re-written and re-recorded. George rewrote lyrics and melodies, {{and the result was}} called Harlequin II.|$|R
