40|$|Aim: Premium wine {{production}} {{can only be}} made from quality grapes. The determination of harvest date and the assessment of grape maturity need to be as accurate as possible. Therefore, technological and phenolic ripenings are monitored during grape maturation, taking into account environmental factors. The objective {{of this study was}} to calibrate and compare to standard analytical procedures a recently-introduced hand-held optical sensor based on the epidermal screening of fruit chlorophyll fluorescence. Anthocyanin, flavonol and chlorophyll contents on intact berries and bunches are simultaneously monitored. Method and result: Wet chemistry and optical sensor (Multiplex®) measurements were performed on berry samples and <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> from several plots of Pinot meunier, Pinot noir and Chardonnay in the Champagne region.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{composition}} of grapevine berry at harvest {{is a major}} determinant of wine quality. Optimal oenological maturity of berries is characterized by a high sugar/acidity ratio, high anthocyanin content in the skin, and low astringency. However, harvest time is still mostly determined empirically, based on crude biochemical composition and berry tasting. In this context, it is interesting to identify genes that are expressed/repressed specifically at the late stages of ripening and which may be used as indicators of maturity. Results <b>Whole</b> <b>bunches</b> and berries sorted by density were collected in vineyard on Chardonnay (white cultivar) grapevines for two consecutive years at three stages of ripening (7 -days before harvest (TH- 7), harvest (TH), and 10 -days after harvest (TH+ 10)). Microvinification and sensory analysis indicate that the quality of the wines made from the <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> collected at TH- 7, TH and TH+ 10 differed, TH providing the highest quality wines. In parallel, gene expression was studied with Qiagen/Operon microarrays using two types of samples, i. e. <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> and berries sorted by density. Only 12 genes were consistently up- or down-regulated in <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> and density sorted berries for the two years studied in Chardonnay. 52 genes were differentially expressed between the TH- 7 and TH samples. In order to determine whether these genes followed a similar pattern of expression during the late stages of berry ripening in a red cultivar, nine genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis with Cabernet Sauvignon grown under two different temperature regimes affecting the precocity of ripening. The expression profiles and their relationship to ripening were confirmed in Cabernet Sauvignon for seven genes, encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, a galactinol synthase, a late embryogenesis abundant protein, a dirigent-like protein, a histidine kinase receptor, a valencene synthase and a putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase. Conclusions This set of up- and down-regulated genes characterize the late stages of berry ripening in the two cultivars studied, and are indirectly linked to wine quality. They might be used directly or indirectly to design immunological, biochemical or molecular tools aimed at the determination of optimal ripening in these cultivars. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare.
