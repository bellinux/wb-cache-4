Due {{to the particular}} characteristics of the noble rotted grape, these wines (eg, Tokaji Aszú, Sauternes, Trockenbeerenauslese types, etc) have many characteristic features, including higher or lower residual sugar content and unique aroma composition. The technology, biochemistry, and special characteristics <b>of</b> botrytized <b>wines</b> have been researched for a long time. This review outlines the main directions of the current studies, giving a brief overview on the recent findings. Beside the traditional wine types, noble rot is increasingly utilized in making newer sweet wine styles and straw (passito) wines, which generates a series of new interesting experimental results. The fungus–grape interactions during the noble rot, the induced botrytization, the microbial communities <b>of</b> botrytized <b>wines,</b> and the volatile compounds having key roles in the distinct aroma <b>of</b> these <b>wine</b> styles are being focused on in the current studies in this field.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} sensory {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> experimentally produced by “Malvasia Istriana” grapevine in the Tuscany coast (Grosseto) along a ten years period. The training system was double Guyot with plant production of approximately 2 kg. Most notably were produced two types <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> with or without withering in the plant, in the latter case the 70 % of the branches were cut off two or three weeks before harvesting. Because of seasonal conditions are not always favorable, in some years the latter type has not been <b>overripe</b> <b>grapes</b> were harvested between 30 September and 2 October. Vinification was carried out under the same conditions using temperature control and using the same yeast strain. In one case, namely for <b>wine</b> <b>of</b> 1995, was performed a refinement in oak barrels by topping up of must obtained from <b>grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>overripe</b> 1997 vintages, 1999 and 2000, racking is then occurred in 2002. Altogether we had 6 vintages and 9 wines which were subjected to the main physical-chemical analysis for a general characterization. Also were conducted by a trained sensory analysis sessions examining the wines at the same time, in order to evaluate the evolution of sensory descriptors and their hold over time. For this purpose we used a descriptive card specially crafted structured not parametric. The evaluations expressed in sensory analysis have been subjected to factorial analysis prior to standardization. Generally speaking most <b>of</b> the <b>wines</b> is characterized by significant softness that is partly attributable to the low fixed acidity of the grapes. There is also a good grip in time for the balance <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> and the permanence of fruity notes, acacia honey and dried fruits, wines to age. The floral notes, on the other hand, there are only about young wines and those produced from <b>grapes</b> not <b>overriped.</b> <b>Of</b> particular importance have appeared the sensorial characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> aged in wood barrels, with a technique similar to the "Solera", for the intensity and olfactory persistence. In the light of the results obtained, discussed in relation to the characteristics of the vintage and physical-chemical analysis, it can be concluded that the “Malvasia Istriana” grape lends itself to the production <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> from <b>overripe</b> <b>grapes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the oenological sector, the {{withering}} {{process is}} of particular importance {{in the production of}} dry and sweet dessert wines due to the total or partial use <b>of</b> <b>overripe</b> and/or dehydrated <b>grapes.</b> This complex process leads to several changes in the chemical-physical characteristics of white grape berries affecting the wine quality and, {{at the end of the}} dehydration period, different visual attributes are usually present in the berry skins. The aim of this work, therefore, was to study the properties of Erbaluce dried grapes of varying external colors, classified into three groups based on reflectance colorimetry (green, gold and blue). The chemical composition, volatile profile and mechanical attributes were investigated, focusing on establishing relationships between CIEL *. a *. b * parameters of dehydrated grapes and their chemical-physical characteristics. The higher values of the glucose-fructose ratio, together with the higher content of sugars, gluconic acid and glycerol, but lower titratable acidity, suggests the presence of. Botrytis cinerea Pers. infection in blue withered berries, which has been microbiologically confirmed. Regarding the instrumental mechanical properties, blue dehydrated grapes were characterized by a lower skin hardness and higher skin thickness in agreement with the higher weight loss experienced. Finally, the determination of free and bound volatile compounds showed that some of them were only found in blue withered berries, δ-lactones being considered the main chemical markers of the noble rot infection that are important for the odor character. C- 10 alkyl massoia lactone was the most abundant volatile compound in blue botrytized grapes...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} instigators of a stuck fermentation. One {{of the most}} common found in winemaking is a nitrogen deficient must. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient in the growth and development of yeasts and is usually provided from the wine grapes themselves. Grapes grown in vineyards with soils lacking in nitrogen or grape varieties, such as Chardonnay and Riesling, which are naturally prone to have low nitrogen to sugar ratios will be at greater risk for having a stuck fermentation. Another cause rooted in the vineyard is from <b>overripe</b> <b>grapes.</b> <b>Grapes</b> that are <b>overripe</b> will have high levels of sugars that translates into higher alcohol content. Yeast are unable to reproduce in an environment with 16-18% ABV but in an environment with multiple stressors the fermentation could get stuck even before the alcohol level reaches that point.|$|R
50|$|In the {{creation}} of the dessert style Viognier, the grapes are often picked in late October or early November. A common harvest technique used in the Condrieu is known as à l'assiette where a plate is held underneath a Viognier vine that is then shaken to allow the <b>overripe</b> <b>grapes</b> to drop onto the plate. Fermentation is then stopped early through the use of sulphur to allow the wine to retain a high level of residual sugar. The wine is then chilled and put through sterile filtering to ensure that the wine is stable and will not start fermenting again in the bottle.|$|R

40|$|Organic {{extracts}} of musts and red wines {{marked by}} dried fruit and cooked fruit aromas {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography coupled to olfactometry and mass spectrometry. Thanks to this analytical approach we identified a fragrant lactone corresponding to an odorant zone reminiscent of coconut and dried figs as 5, 6 -dihydro- 6 -pentyl- 2 H-pyran- 2 -one (C 10 massoia lactone). Using chiral GC-GC-MS, we show that only the (R) -C 10 massoia lactone is found in musts and wines. Its detection thresholds were 10 µg/L and 11 µg/L in must and wine model solution, respectively. In Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon musts marked by dried fruit flavors from <b>overripe</b> <b>grapes,</b> its concentration reached 68 µg/L. In contrast, in wines marked by these flavors, it never exceeded 20 µg/L. We show that (R) -C 10 massoia lactone is reduced to (R) -δ-decalactone during alcoholic fermentation. In addition, we underline the contribution of temperature {{during the growing season}} on its level in old red wines...|$|R

5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor <b>of</b> <b>overripe</b> fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with oak trees.|$|R
