5|$|The 1926 World Series {{was also}} known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised the child that he <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> a home run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, {{and a friend of}} Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly {{inflated}} it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|U-38 would depart Lorient with Liebe {{in command}} {{once again on}} 18 December 1940. The eighth war patrol of her career would involve {{operations}} again in the Northwest Approaches. During this patrol, the submarine <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> and sink two ships. On 27 December, U-38 destroyed the British ship SS Waiotira, and on 31 December, she sank the Swedish motor freighter SS Valparaiso, sailing {{as part of the}} HX-97 convoy from Halifax to Glasgow. U-38 returned to port on 22 January 1941.|$|E

50|$|On May 20, Rickard hit {{his first}} career lead-off homerun {{to start a}} game against the Angels. The very next batter (Manny Machado) <b>would</b> also <b>hit</b> a homer, giving the Orioles their 8th set of {{back-to-back}} homers on the year.

5|$|While the {{hurricane}} was approaching the Carolinas, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Jacksonville, Florida to Beaufort, North Carolina at 2100 UTC on September 14. Six hours later, these were extended northward to Virginia Capes. By 1530 UTC on September 15, forecasters predicted that {{the hurricane}} <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> North Carolina in 12 hours and ordered hurricane warnings from Wilmington, North Carolina to Cape Hatteras. At the same time, the storm warning was expanded northward to Boston, Massachusetts, and later to Eastport, Maine. The early warnings gave ample time for preparation for the storm in Norfolk, reducing damages considerably. Residents in Virginia evacuated farther inland to escape the storm.|$|E
5|$|For {{her fifth}} patrol, U-38 would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940. She was {{to patrol the}} waters off {{southern}} Ireland. During this operation, Liebe <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> six ships, two of which were sailing in convoy at the time. On 14 June, U-38 sank the Greek steam freighter SS Mount Myrto. The next day, U-38 sank two ships, both sailing as part of Convoy HX-47, sailing from Halifax to England. First sunk was the Canadian steam freighter SS Erik Boye, followed by the Norwegian motor tanker MV Italia. Five days later, on 20 June, the Swedish steam freighter SS Tilia Gorthon was torpedoed and sunk. The Belgian steam freighter SS Luxembourg was destroyed on 21 June, followed by the Greek steam freighter SS Neion the following day. After three weeks at sea, U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July.|$|E
5|$|On July 31 at AT Park, in a 3-1 {{win over}} the Washington Nationals and in support of fellow {{rotation}} mate Matt Cain's one hundredth career win, Bumgarner pinch-hit for him after Cain threw five no-hit innings on ninety-three pitches. Bumgarner <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> an opposite-field leadoff double off the bricks, becoming the first Giants pitcher to record a pinch-hit double in a pitch-hitting appearance since Ray Sadecki did so in , according to CSN Bay Area. The Giants inserted pinch-runner and another fellow rotation mate Jeff Samardzija, who would score later in the inning, marking the first occurrence in a San Francisco Giants game that a pinch-hitting pitcher reached base, was substituted for by a pinch-running pitcher, and scored a run.|$|E

5|$|Early on October8, {{after turning}} west-southwestward {{away from the}} Greater Antilles, Iris began {{strengthening}} again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) before the storm <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> Belize. It rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95mph (150km/h) to 140mph (225km/h) in a 12-hour period on October8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar (1.12inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi (11km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3mi (5km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde {{into the center of}} Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.|$|E
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E

5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in overcast weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his first since the San Marino Grand Prix, with a time of 1:10.410. He was joined on the front row of the grid by teammate Coulthard who was three-tenths of a second off Häkkinen's pace. Coulthard felt he could have challenged for pole position but he clipped a kerb going into Castrol Kurve on his final run which cost him time. Both drivers were satisfied with their car's balance. Barrichello qualified third and said that he changed his car's set-up to help him to achieve a better lap time. Michael Schumacher qualified fourth, six-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, and reported that his car's handling was uneven throughout the circuit. He also had a high-speed spin during the session and aborted his final run after he made a mistake at the exit of Gösser corner. Trulli qualified fifth having used the soft compound tyres to set his fastest lap time. Zonta and Villeneuve set the sixth and seventh fastest times respectively for BAR, both drivers spun during the session. Fisichella recorded the eighth quickest time although he lost a bargeboard when he went off the circuit. He felt he could have secured fifth but a yellow-flag caused him to reduce his pace. Salo and Verstappen completed the top ten positions. Diniz missed qualifying in the top ten by two-thousands of a second and spun off while setting lap times, triggering a yellow-flag. de la Rosa managed twelfth, having struggled with the conditions during the session. He qualified ahead of Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld and Wurz. Frentzen, fifteenth, ran the hard compound tyres and his lap times were set early in the session before track conditions had improved. Frentzen said it was because he felt rain <b>would</b> <b>hit</b> the circuit towards the end of qualifying. Herbert started from sixteenth, after stopping on one run because to a broken left rear suspension caused by a loose suspension bracket at the Niki Lauda Kurve. A rear wishbone on his car had also been flexing. Alesi qualified seventeenth. Jenson Button used the spare Williams car set up for Ralf Schumacher because Button's race car had engine issues and qualified eighteenth. Button additionally struggled with driving the spare car. His teammate Ralf Schumacher qualified nineteenth in the Williams team's worst qualifying performance of the season. Burti and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} field, covering positions twenty to twenty-two.|$|E
