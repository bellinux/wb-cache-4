40|$|We {{performed}} multiple-breath washouts of N 2 and simultaneous <b>washins</b> of He and SF 6 with fixed {{tidal volume}} (approximately 1, 250 ml) and preinspiratory lung volume (approximately the subject's {{functional residual capacity}} in the standing position) in four normal subjects (mean age 40 yr) standing and supine in normal gravity (1 G) and during exposure to sustained microgravity (microG). The primary objective {{was to examine the}} influence of diffusive processes on the residual, nongravitational ventilatory inhomogeneity in the lung in microG. We calculated several indexes of convective ventilatory inhomogeneity from each gas species. A normal degree of ventilatory inhomogeneity was seen in the standing position at 1 G that was largely unaltered in the supine position. When we compared the standing position in 1 G with microG, there were reductions in phase III slope in all gases, consistent with a reduction in convection-dependent inhomogeneity in the lung in microG, although considerable convective inhomogeneity persisted in microG. The reductions in the indexes of convection-dependent inhomogeneity were greater for He than for SF 6, suggesting that the distances between remaining nonuniformly ventilated compartments in microG were short enough for diffusion of He to be an effective mechanism to reduce gas concentration differences between them...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{tidal volume}} single-breath <b>washins</b> (SBW) by using tracers of different diffusivity and varied {{the time spent}} in microgravity (microG) {{before the start of}} the tests to look for time-dependent effects. SF(6) and CH(4) phase III slopes decreased by 35 and 26 %, respectively, in microG compared with 1 G (P < 0. 05), and the slope difference between gases disappeared. There was no effect of time in microG, suggesting that neither the hypergravity period preceding microG nor the time spent in microG affected gas mixing at volumes near functional residual capacity. In previous studies using SF(6) and He (Lauzon A-M, Prisk GK, Elliott AR, Verbanck S, Paiva M, and West JB. J Appl Physiol 82 : 859 - 865, 1997), the vital capacity SBW showed an increase in slope difference between gases in transient microG, the opposite of the decrease in sustained microG. In contrast, tidal volume SBW showed a decrease in slope difference in both microG conditions. Because it is only the behavior of the more diffusive gas that differed between maneuvers and microG conditions, we speculate that, in the previous vital capacity SBW, the hypergravity period preceding the test in transient microG provoked conformational changes at low lung volumes near the acinar entrance...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-breath N 2 washouts (WO) and <b>washins</b> (WI) were {{performed}} during regular tidal breathing in 11 unsedated healthy steers approaching pulmonary functional maturity (mean body weight = 271 kg). They inspired 20 % O 2 in 80 % Ar during the WO and air during the WI. For each steer, we computed two indexes of ventilation inhomogeneity from the N 2 WO curves: 1) the curvilinearity of the logarithm of end-tidal N 2 concentrations {{as a function}} of cumulative expired volume reflected in the ratio of two slopes fitted between 100 and 50 % and between 50 and 10 %, respectively, of end-tidal N 2 concentration of the first breath of the WO; and 2) the N 2 phase III slope divided by the mean expired concentration (Sn) of each breath also plotted {{as a function of}} cumulative expired volume. Equivalent computation of both parameters was done on WI and WO curves, and similar results were obtained. The mean slope ratio was 0. 812 +/- 0. 119 (SD) for all the steers, which is consistent with topographic gravity-dependent specific ventilation distribution inhomogeneity. Sn was independent of the breath number both for WO and WI (mean Sn = 0. 130 +/- 0. 057 liters- 1), suggesting that emptying between unequally ventilated units, is synchronous. This behavior resembles that observed in rats postmortem (S. Verbanck, E. R. Weibel, and M. Paiva. J. Appl Physiol. 71 : 847 - 854, 1991) but contrasts with experiments in humans, in whom convection-dependent ventilation inhomogeneities generate a marked increase in Sn throughout the entire WO (A. B. H. Crawford, M. Makowska, M. Paiva, and L. A. Engel. J. Appl. Physiol. 59 : 838 - 846, 1985).

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} utility of dynamic imaging namely, wash-in and {{wash-out}} characteristics through multidetector contrast-enhanced computed tomography in differentiating benign and malignant pulmonary masses. Materials and Methods: Seventy-three patients who were suspected to have malignant pulmonary mass {{on the basis of}} clinical symptoms and chest radiograph were included in the study. All the patients underwent multidetector computed tomography scanning, and three series of images were obtained for each patient-noncontrast, early enhanced, and 15 min delayed enhanced scans. Computed tomography (CT) findings were assessed in terms of <b>washin,</b> absolute, and relative percentage washout of contrast. Biopsy of the mass was done and sent for histopathological evaluation. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve for diagnosing malignancy in the lung masses were calculated by considering both the wash-in and wash-out characteristics at dynamic CT and plotting the receiver operating curve after the final diagnosis which was obtained by histopathological evaluation. Results: Threshold net enhancement (<b>washin)</b> value of > 22. 5 HU had sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 88. 5 %, 57. 1 %, and 82 %, respectively, in predicting malignancy.

METHODS: DCS and VGE survival times from 95 controls for a 60 min PB prior to 2 -hr or 4 -hr exposures to 4. 37 psia are statistically compared to 3 break in PB conditions: a 10 min (n= 40), 20 min (n= 40), or 60 min break (n= 32) 30 min into the PB followed by 30 min of PB. Ascent rate was 1, 524 meters / min and all exposures included light exercise and 4 min of VGE monitoring of heart chambers at 16 min intervals. DCS survival time for combined control and air breaks were described with an accelerated log logistic model where exponential N 2 <b>washin</b> during air break was described with a 10 min half-time and washout during PB with a 60 min half-time. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} VGE or DCS survival times among 3 different air breaks, or when air breaks were compared to control VGE times.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the slope of the}} alveolar plateau for inert tracer gases that were washed out from mixed venous blood. Two pairs of tracer gases were used (He, SFe) and (C 2 H 2, Freon 22). The gases of each pair share almost the same blood-gas partition coefïicient but they have different diffusive properties in the gas phase. The experiments were performed in healthy subjects at rest and at three levels of exercise (75, 150, 225 W). Each experiment started with the alveolar <b>washin</b> of the tracer gases by adding these gases to inspired air. This <b>washin</b> was continued for several minutes in order to dissolve suffìcient amounts of the tracer gases in the body tissues. Subsequently, the tracer gases were washed out. In this paper, the slopes of the alveolar plateaus are defined as the relative increase of the concentration per second. Steeper slopes were found for the heavier gases (SF 6 and Freon 22) in comparison with those for the lighter gases of the two pairs (He and C 2 H 2). This finding ma¡' be ascribed to the contribution of diffusionlimited gas mixing in the lung to the slope of the alveolar plateau. For each gas, the slope for the first expiration during washout (alveolar washout) was considerably smaller than that for the later part of washout (mixed venous u'ashout), and the difference amounts to about 560 /o and 760 /o of the slope during mixed venous washout at rest and at the highest level of exercise, respectively. As a ñrst approximation, this difference may be considered to represent the contribution to the slope of the continued gas exchange across the alveolo-capillary membrane during expiration. ln theory. this contribution can be computed from the ratio of the alveolar ventilation and alveolar volume (VA/VA), and this is confirmed by our results...|$|E

Material and Methods: Wearing the sterile glove with liquid culture, we obtained 100 Samples from the staff’s hands of three departments (clerical department, emergency ward and central laboratory) of Emam Reza hospital. After that, the samples were cultured. Results: Of all personnel, 40 % have the habit of washing their hands. Of these, 95 percent wash their hands with water and soap, and 5 percent with alcohol rubs. Of 100 cultured samples, 90 have microorganisms including non-pathogen gram-positive bacillus (29 %), coagulase-positive staphylococcus (39 %), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (47 %), Enterococci (3 %), micrococcus (25 %) and candida (3 %). Contamination in those who had not washed their hands is 62. 6 % and in those who washed is 37. 7 % (P= 0. 04).

To reduce the rate of contamination, it is helpful if we ask staff to wash their hands while going out of hospital. Keywords: Microbial Flora; Hospital’s Staff; Hand <b>Washin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Post-hybridization washing is an {{essential}} part of microarray experiments. Both the quality of the experimental washing protocol and adequate consideration of washing in intensity calibration ultimately affect the quality of the expression estimates extracted from the microarray intensities. Results: We conducted experiments on GeneChip microarrays with altered protocols for washing, scanning and staining to study the probe-level intensity changes as a function of the number of washing cycles. For calibration and analysis of the intensity data we make use of the ‘hook ’ method which allows intensity contributions due to non-specific and specific hybridization of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes to be disentangled in a sequence specific manner. On average, washing according to the standard protocol removes about 90 % of the non-specific background and about 30 - 50 % and less than 10 % of the specific targets from the MM and PM, respectively. Analysis of the washing kinetics shows that the signal-to-noise ratio doubles roughly every ten stringent washing cycles. Washing can be characterized by time-dependent rate constants which reflect the heterogeneous character of target binding to microarray probes. We propose an empirical washing function which estimates the survival of probe bound targets. It depends on the intensity contribution due to specific and nonspecific hybridization per probe which can be estimated for each probe using existing methods. The <b>washin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effect of UV {{irradiation}} on the bacterial load of shell eggs and of a roller conveyor belt. Methods and Results: The natural bacterial load on the eggshell of clean eggs was significantly reduced by a standard UV treatment of 4. 7 s; from 4. 47 to 3. 57 log CFU per eggshell. For very dirty eggs no significant reduction was observed. Eggs inoculated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (4. 74 and 4. 64 log CFU per eggshell respectively) passed the conveyor belt and were exposed to UV for 4. 7 and 18. 8 s. The reduction of both inoculated bacteria on the eggshell was comparable and significant for both exposure times (3 and 4 log CFU per eggshell). Escherichia coli was reduced but still detectable on the conveyor rollers. The internal bacterial contamination of eggs filled up with diluent containing E. coli or S. aureus was not influenced by UV irradiation. Conclusions: There is a significant lethal effect of UV irradiation on the bacterial contamination of clean eggshells and recent shell contamination, contamination of rollers can be controlled and the internal contamination of eggs is not reduced. Significance and Impact of the Study: The penetration of UV into organic material appears to be poor and UV disinfection {{can be used as}} an alternative for egg <b>washin...</b>|$|E
