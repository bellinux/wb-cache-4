5|$|As a {{consequence}} of {{his role in the}} death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E

5|$|In 1538, {{the current}} walls of Jerusalem were {{completed}} on {{the orders of}} Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. These walls, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> walls built by the Armenians, determined {{the outline of the}} quarter. In the 1562–63 record, only 189 Armenians were counted, whereas 640 were counted by the Ottomans in 1690, an increase of 239%. According to the chronicler Simeon Lehatsi only some twelve Armenian families lived in Jerusalem in 1615–16. The significant increase in the population in 1690 is attributed to urbanization experienced by the Armenians and other Christians. Thus Armenians came to make up 22.9% of Jerusalem's Christians by 1690, becoming the second largest Christian community.|$|E
5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life. By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E

On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters {{did not want to}} deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> politics of the NWA at the time. While they left the NWA they kept promoting the NWA World Middleweight Championship as well as the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship that they had controlled for years.|$|E

As of early July 2017, no decision has been rendered.|$|E
5|$|The {{first year}} of his reign was {{peaceful}} because the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, was still occupied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> consolidation of the Ottoman Empire. Michael supported Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire {{in the autumn of}} 1419. They captured the city of Turnu Severin that Michael's father had lost to the Ottomans, but it was put under Sigismund's control. In retaliation, the sultan broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses on the Danube to the Ottomans and to pay the tribute he had failed to send during the previous three years. Michael was also forced to send his two sons, Michael and Radu, as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

40|$|Bubble column reactors, with {{or without}} solid particles, {{have a number of}} {{applications}} in the chemical, petrochemical, biochemical and environmental industries. A number of these industrial applications require internals such as baffles, heat transfer surfaces and special distributors to meet demands. Proper selection and design of these internals can lead to the improved performance and efficiency of a bubble column reactor. Several experiments are carried out in a bubble column equipped with a concentric tube bundle (CT) and an internal combination consisting of a concentric tube bundle and concentric baffle (or static mixer) (CTB) respectively. Neutrally buoyant particles are used to determine the effect of the CT and CTB <b>internals</b> on <b>the</b> local flow structures in the equipped column respectively. More upward, near-linear particle movements are observed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> over <b>the</b> CT <b>internal.</b> Several non-linear particle movements are also observed. Overall bulk liquid circulation flow patterns are proposed for the intermediate to high gas velocity range based on the observed local flow structures for both internals. Comparisons are made between the gas holdups obtained during internal equipment and that of a comparable hollow bubble column from <b>the</b> literature. Both <b>internals</b> increase <b>the</b> gas holdup of a hollow bubble column. However, <b>the</b> increases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> are higher by more than 25 % of that obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> on average. <b>The</b> effect of <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> on average bubble size is investigated for the small bubble class. Smaller average diameters are obtained when <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> is used. <b>The</b> interfacial area in the presence of <b>the</b> two <b>internals</b> is determined respectively. Higher interfacial areas are obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CT <b>internal.</b> <b>The</b> average difference in interfacial area is 54. 0 m 2 /m 3. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>internals</b> on mixing time is determined through dye and aqueous salt tracer studies. In both instances, higher mixing times are obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal.</b> Liquid backmixing is quantified through the axial dispersion coefficients obtained from the salt tracer studies. The axial dispersion coefficients obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CT <b>internal</b> are higher than that of <b>the</b> CTB <b>internal</b> by about 15 % on average...|$|R

5|$|After Rajrajeshwori {{took over}} the regency, she was {{pressured}} by Knox to pay the annual pension of 82,000 rupees to the ex-King as per the obligations of the treaty, which paid off the vast debt that Rana Bahadur Shah had accumulated in Varanasi due to his spendthrift habits. The Nepalese court also felt it prudent to keep Rana Bahadur in isolation in Nepal itself, {{rather than in the}} British controlled India, and that paying off Rana Bahadur's debts could facilitate his return at an opportune moment. Rajrajeshowri's presence in Kathmandu also stirred unrest among the courtiers that aligned themselves around her and Subarnaprabha. Sensing an imminent hostility, Knox aligned himself with Subarnaprabha and attempted to interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> politics of Nepal. Getting a wind of this matter, Rajrajeshowri dissolved the government and elected new ministers, with Damodar Pande as the mul kaji, while the Resident Knox, finding himself persona non grata and the objectives of his mission frustrated, voluntarily left Kathmandu to reside in Makwanpur citing a cholera epidemic. Subarnaprabha and the members of her faction were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal,</b> emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E

They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> carotid arteries.|$|E
