5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{refused to}} abandon the area completely {{out of fear that}} such an action would make them appear weak. While they planned a response, Indians raided the San Saba horse herd, stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20soldiers. In October 1759, Spain sent the San Sabá commander, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack. The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla's army to a fortified Wichita village, surrounded by a stockade and a moat, where natives brandished French guns and <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> French flag. After a skirmish in which 52Spaniards were killed, wounded, or deserted, the Spanish retreated. The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat, but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who ventured out. By 1769, Spain abandoned the fort.|$|E
5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> white towel {{on the end of}} a hockey stick in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4–1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E
25|$|The British {{infantry}} resisted {{for several}} hours, {{but the numbers}} of wounded and killed increased and ammunition ran out. Finally, as the main British force could be seen retreating into Ladysmith, Carleton gave the order to surrender. A British officer <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> white flag at the same time. Some of the British troops had seen no reason for the surrender and felt themselves humiliated by the order. Eight hundred soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Isolated single (Xenopus) {{muscle fibers}} were stained with a nonpermeant potential-probing dye, merocyanine rhodanine (WW 375) or merocyanine oxazolone (NK 2367). When the fiber was massively stimulated, <b>an</b> {{absorption}} change (<b>wave</b> <b>a),</b> {{which seemed to}} reflect the action potential, occurred. Simultaneous recording of optical changes and intracellular action potentials revealed that the time-course of <b>wave</b> <b>a</b> was slower than the action potential: the peak of <b>wave</b> <b>a</b> was attained at 1 ms, and the peak of action potential was reached at 0. 5 ms after the stimulation. This difference suggests that <b>wave</b> <b>a</b> represents the potential changes of the whole tubular membrane and the surface membrane, whereas the action potential represents a surface potential change. This idea was substantiated by recording absorption signals preferentially from the surface membrane by recording the absorption changes {{at the edge of}} the fiber. <b>Wave</b> <b>a</b> obtained by this method was as quick as the intracellular action potential. The value of radial conduction velocity of action potential along the T system, calculated by comparing the action potential with <b>wave</b> <b>a,</b> was 6. 4 em/s at 24. 5 ~ in fair agreement with Gonz~ilez-Serratos (1971.

25|$|When the Rangers {{arrived at}} the cabin site they found the Ament and the other men safely barricaded inside the cabin. Ament <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> white flag through the roof to signal the {{soldiers}} as they approached. Outside, they found the undisturbed body of Phillips lying where he had fallen, in the dooryard with his face upturned. He had been shot through {{the left side of}} his chest and through the stomach. His body was badly tomahawked, and had slashes across one eye and his neck. He had not, however, been scalped. The Rangers formed a small detachment and set off in pursuit of the attackers but they soon gave up and returned to Hennepin with Phillips' remains. The funeral took place the next day and was attended by citizens and soldiers alike.|$|E
25|$|Kingani {{was spotted}} from the shore, and Spicer-Simson's men quickly {{took to the}} water, cutting Kingani off from her base. Taken by {{surprise}} Junge ordered Kinganis speed to be increased, but as the six-pounder gun mounted in the forepart of Kingani could only fire forward, {{he was forced to}} circle to aim at the lead British boat, Mimi. The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed back to shore.|$|E

25|$|On June 14, Hamas gunmen {{completed}} {{the takeover of}} the central building of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service's headquarters in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas members took over vehicles and weapons in the compound, which was considered the Palestinian Authority's main symbol in the Strip. The Preventive Security Service cooperated with Israel in the past, and has been armed by the United States. It has been identified with Fatah powerhouse Mohammed Dahlan, who has become a figure hated by the Islamists in Gaza. The gunmen who entered the compound held a prayer there and <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> flag on the building's rooftop. At least 10 people were killed. Hamas TV broadcast a display of weapons inside the building, as well as jeeps, mortar shells and bulletproof vests seized in the compound, which according to Hamas, were smuggled to Fatah by Israel and the Americans {{in the past few}} months through the border with Egypt.|$|E
25|$|With Peñaloza's death, panicked {{officials}} in the Nogales, Sonora, city hall and the Mexican Consul in Nogales, Arizona, Jose Garza Zertuche, worked {{to bring about a}} cease-fire before further bloodshed. After initial contacts with Lt. Col. Herman were unsuccessful in ending the violence--the military commander in Nogales, Arizona, was wounded in the thigh during the fight--local Mexican officials agreed to raise a white flag over the community's most prominent structure at the time, the Mexican customs house. About 7:45 pm the Mexicans <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> large white flag of surrender over their customs building. Lt. Col. Herman observed this and ordered an immediate cease-fire. Snipers on both sides continued shooting for a while after the cease fire, but were eventually silenced by the efforts of their leaders on both sides. As a tenuous and suspicious peace fell on the border community, sporadic rifle shots were heard throughout the night, causing many to fear further violence. Subsequently, many non-combatants in Nogales, Sonora, fled south, away from their city. The international border in this important port of entry remained closed until the late the next day.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 20, two 75mm guns {{commanded}} by a retired artillery officer Captain Orad de la Torre, plus one 155mm gun joined the siege. Also, a Breguet XIX warplane from the Cuatro Vientos air base bombed the barracks. At half past ten, one bomb wounded Fanjul and Sierra. A few moments later some soldiers inside the barracks <b>waved</b> <b>a</b> white sheet from the windows apparently {{with the intention of}} surrendering. Against the orders of Lieutenant Moreno of the Assault Guards, who were leading the attack, the crowd ran forward but other defenders fired at them from the barracks with machine guns. This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Captain Orad de la Torre and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess room and then shot themselves. At least some of the Falangist and monarchist volunteers wearing civilian clothes were able to slip away in the confusion.|$|E
