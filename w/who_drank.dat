5|$|A {{second draft}} was {{finished}} by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, {{and the boy}} Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight was deleted, {{as well as those}} <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a final shooting script.|$|E
5|$|Robert Eddison as the Grail Knight: The {{guardian}} of the Grail <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal {{as long as he}} stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, <b>who</b> <b>drank,</b> initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E

5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of alcohol is {{associated with an increased}} risk of gouty arthritis and a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Two recent studies report that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Among those <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> regularly, the one-quarter <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> the most were up to 50% less likely to develop the disease compared to the half <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> the least.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that {{moderate}} consumption of alcohol had a protective effect against intermittent claudication. The lowest risk was seen in men <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> 1 to 2 drinks per day and in women <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> half to 1 drink per day.|$|E

25|$|Coffee is {{no longer}} {{thought to be a}} risk factor for {{coronary}} heart disease. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> more than four cups a day. Moreover, in one preliminary study, habitual coffee consumption was associated with improved vascular function. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and stroke is less likely with 3–5 cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day but more likely with over 5 cups per day. A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.|$|E

25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 34 studies found a reduced risk of mortality from {{coronary heart disease}} in men <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> 2 - 4 drinks per day and women <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> 1 - 2 drinks per day. Alcohol {{has been found to}} have anticoagulant properties. Thrombosis is lower among moderate drinkers than abstainers.Ridker, P., et al. Moderate alcohol intake may reduce risk of thrombosis. American Medical Association press release, September 22, 1994 A {{meta-analysis of}} randomized trials found that alcohol consumption in moderation decreases serum levels of fibrinogen, a protein that promotes clot formation, while it increases levels of tissue type plasminogen activator, an enzyme that helps dissolve clots. These changes were estimated to reduce coronary heart disease risk by about 24%. Another meta-analysis in 2011 found favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, adiponectin, and fibrinogen associated with moderate alcohol consumption.|$|E
25|$|Nitrate, {{which is}} found mostly in {{drinking}} water from ground sources, is a powerful teratogen. A case-control study in rural Australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and congenital malformations found that those <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> the nitrate-infected groundwater, as opposed to rain water, ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal defects, and cardiac defects.|$|E

25|$|Another myth {{associated}} with Boötes by Hyginus {{is that of}} Icarius, who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by Dionysus. Icarius made wine so strong that those <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> it appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. Maera, Icarius' dog, brought his daughter Erigone to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as Virgo, and Maera as Canis Major or Canis Minor.|$|E
25|$|One {{research}} {{published in}} 2009 {{has shown that}} moderate green tea or black tea consumption (three or more cups per day) can reduce breast cancer risk by 37% in women younger than 50 years old, comparing with women <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> no tea at all. But no association was found for overall women. However that study {{has been criticized for}} inaccuracy and another study found no substantial association between breast cancer and tea consumption in the overall, but found a weak inverse association between caffeine-containing beverages and risk of post-menopausal breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|People {{who lived}} in the PFOA {{contaminated}} area around DuPont's Washington Works Washington, WV facility were found to have higher levels of PFOA in their blood from drinking water. The highest PFOA levels in drinking water were found in the Little Hocking water system, with an average concentration of 3.55 parts per billion during 2002–2005. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> more tap water, ate locally grown fruits and vegetables, or ate local meat, were all associated with having higher PFOA levels. Residents who used water carbon filter systems had lower PFOA levels.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{study of}} several {{thousand}} men and women, {{found that women who}} regularly drank cola-based sodas (three or more a day) had significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) of ~4 % in the hip than those who didn't, even though researchers controlled for important factors like calcium and vitamin D intake. The study also found that women <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> non-cola soft drinks didn't appear to have lower BMD and that BMD of women drinking decaffeineted cola wasn't as low as women drinking caffeinated cola sodas. The study found that the effect of regular consumption of cola sodas was not significant on men's BMD.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, after {{extensive}} artillery bombardment, a breach was {{opened in the}} main walls of the fortress of Seringapatam. An attack led by Major-General Baird secured the fortress. Wellesley secured {{the rear of the}} advance, posting guards at the breach and then stationed his regiment at the main palace. After hearing news of the death of the Tipu Sultan, Wellesley was the first at the scene to confirm his death, checking his pulse. Over the coming day, Wellesley grew increasingly concerned over the lack of discipline among his men, <b>who</b> <b>drank</b> and pillaged the fortress and city. To restore order, several soldiers were flogged and four hanged.|$|E
