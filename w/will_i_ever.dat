Jon Glaser, a comedy actor, guest starred as Mike, a nametag-wearing employee who grows angry with Liz Lemon after showing her {{a quote from}} her book. Caitlin Fowler and Shawn Gianella appeared in [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] as porn versions of Jenna Maroney and Jack Donaghy, respectively, while adult film actress Savanna Samson played the porn version of Liz, as part of Tracy Jordan owning Liz's life rights. At {{the end of the}} episode, Gianella and Samson recreate an earlier scene in which Jack gives Liz her retainer, though, upon receiving the retainer, Samson asks Gianella [...] "How <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> thank you?" [...] prompting Tracy to stop production. This whole scene is a reference to a [...] released earlier the same year. Despite rumors to the contrary, the actors playing 'porn versions' of 30 Rock characters were not the same performers featured on the original parody.|$|E
500|$|On October 24, 2012 a {{video was}} {{released}} showing Patrick B. Moran, the Congressman's {{son and a}} field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign. In response to the person's suggestion about trying to cast votes {{in the names of}} 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills. [...] The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, [...] "at no point have I, or <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? <b>Will</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

When Philippe first saw her, {{he is said}} to have remarked [...] "how <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> be able to sleep with her?" [...] Madame de Sévigné noted how popular the new Madame was with the court. She became renowned for her brusque candor, upright character, and lack of vanity. Her letters record how willingly she gave up sharing Philippe's bed at his request after their children's births and how unwillingly she quietly endured the presence of his male favourites in their household.|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. [...] "I'd say {{the main difference between}} this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> ... That {{is one of the reasons}} I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you." ...|$|E
