500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again.

In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When <b>We</b> <b>Was</b> Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design....

Dead Can Dance's 1996 album Spiritchaser includes the track [...] "Indus", the melody of which was found to be very similar to that of [...] "Within You Without You".

Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding."

500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y.

So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers….

500|$|Madonna {{was again}} {{received}} negatively for her leading role as Abbie in John Schlesinger's film The Next Best Thing (2000). Her first big screen collaboration, with her then-husband director Guy Ritchie, was Swept Away (2002). A remake of Lina Wertmüller's Italian {{film of the}} same name, it was as a commercial and critical failure. Swept Away was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards, winning five, including Worst Actress for Madonna. She had a cameo appearance in the James Bond film Die Another Day (2002), and sang its theme song. The next year, Madonna appeared in the television sitcom Will & Graces episode [...] "Dolls and Dolls". In 2008, Madonna made her directorial debut with Filth and Wisdom, as well as producing and writing I Am Because We Are, a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians. The latter was honored with a Do Something Award by VH1. Her second directorial effort, <b>W.E.,</b> <b>was</b> released in 2011. A biographical film about the affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, the film was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She also directed the 17-minute film secretprojectrevolution with Steven Klein in 2013. Dealing with artistic freedom and human rights, the short film was distributed by BitTorrent. Madonna's acting career has attracted a largely negative reception from critics.
