25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} originally {{outlined by}} Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant {{to reconcile the}} differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other universes.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition.

2500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{traces the}} {{earliest}} use (as [...] "Androides") to Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, {{in reference to}} an automaton that St. Albertus Magnus allegedly created. The term [...] "android" [...] appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons. The term android was used in a more modern sense by the French author Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam in his work Tomorrow's Eve (1886). This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, [...] "In this age of Realien advancement, who knows <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls." [...] The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future (1940–1944).|$|E

Spitzer subsequently announced that he would indefinitely suspend his communications director, Darren Dopp, and reassign another top official. When questioned about his promise to bring ethical responsibility to state politics, Spitzer responded by saying [...] "I will not tolerate this behavior", [...] "ethics and accountability must and will remain rigorous in my administration," [...] and that [...] "I have always stated that I want ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of my administration. That is why I requested that the State Inspector General review the allegations with respect to my office, and that is why we have fully cooperated with both inquiries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies {{think these}} studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that {{physical}} {{factors in the}} brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that [...] "We feel we choose, but we don't". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds [...] "How can I call a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?". Philosophers Walter Glannon and Alfred Mele think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because [...] "free will" [...] can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say [...] "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any dualistic notions of free will – but that is an [...] "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down". Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in materialistic terms. In these cases, [...] "free will" [...] means something more like [...] "not coerced" [...] or that [...] "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence {{of these types of}} free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain during decision making.|$|E
2500|$|Terry Bogard is {{typically}} a cheerful and friendly fellow to everyone around him. He seems to bear no ill will towards {{anyone other than}} Geese Howard, the killer of his adoptive father. He {{and his younger brother}} Andy Bogard were orphans adopted by Jeff Bogard, who was killed by Geese Howard when Terry and Andy were children. Wishing to take revenge, Terry trained alone in the streets until he developed a unique fighting style which combines moves from various martial arts. He became strong enough to enter The King of Fighters tournament, in which he {{is often referred to as}} the Legendary Hungry Wolf (from , the Japanese title of his [...] ) for his remarkable skills. Although Terry manages to defeat Geese, he tries to save him when Geese is about to fall from a tower. Geese refuses this help, and seemingly falls to his death, though he's since returned in numerous games. Some time after that, Terry met Geese's son, Rock Howard, and started taking care of him. He treats Rock as his son, but gives him some freedom of choice. Terry appears to fit many Japanese stereotypes for an American character in appearance, personality and speech (his in-game vocabulary is usually limited to American colloquialisms, such as [...] "Okay!" [...] and [...] "Hey, c'mon, c'mon."). [...] He has a pet monkey named [...] which commonly appears around him in some games. Terry is also streetsmart as his knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets and slang is vast. During the Fatal Fury series, Terry meets Blue Mary, with whom he appears to have a longtime relationship.|$|E
