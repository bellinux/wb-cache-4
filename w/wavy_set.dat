40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the features that}} may differentiate cuts made in bone by mechanical and hand-powered saws, specifically investigating the characteristics of commercially available reciprocating saws. The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available reciprocating saw blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with <b>wavy</b> <b>set</b> teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start kerfs and complete kerfs on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize reciprocating saws. The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between reciprocating saw blades. Kerf characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. Inter-blade differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010). Identification of inter-blade differences allows the limited identification of sub-classes within reciprocating saws based on the above characteristics, though blades cannot be uniquely identified. Additionally, interior exit chipping was noted, which has not been mentioned in previous sharp force trauma research. Ultimately, this research has applications for sharp force trauma analysis and further aids in the identification of reciprocating saw use in a forensic context, including dismemberments...|$|E

50|$|The fess dancetty (horizontal zigzag stripe) in {{the chief}} symbolizes Weidenbach’s lordly history, which brought {{it through the}} Lords of Pyrmont and the Electorate of Trier to Count Dietrich IV of Manderscheid-Schleiden. Recalling {{the time of the}} Lordship of Pyrmont and the {{allegiance}} to the Electorate of Trier through the Amt of Manderscheid is the fess dancetty in the chief, but with the tinctures reversed. The main field in the arms is canting for the municipality’s name, Weidenbach, which in German literally means “Willowbrook”, thus explaining the charges there, a willow and a fess abased azure (blue horizontal <b>wavy</b> stripe <b>set</b> below the centre) representing a brook.|$|R
40|$|An {{attention}} has been given to investigate the flow behavior of an incompressible viscous fluid confined in horizontal <b>wavy</b> channels and <b>set</b> in motion due to the movement of the upper wall and the pressure differences. The governing equations have been solved analytically as well as numerically subject to the relevant boundary conditions by assuming that the solution consists of two parts: a mean part and a disturbance or perturbed part. For small and moderate Reynolds numbers, the analytical solution for the perturbed part {{has been found to be}} in good agreement with the numerical one. The effects of Reynolds number, the pressure gradient parameter, and the undulation wavenumber on friction and pressure drop are found to be quite significant. In addition to the flow behavior for both long and short waves and for large Reynolds numbers, the effect of the wall waviness on friction and pressure drop has been examined for any arbitrary amplitude of the wavy wall...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the isogeometric residual-based variational {{multiscale}} (VMS) large eddy simulation of a fully developed turbulent flow over a wavy wall. To assess the predictive capability of the VMS modeling framework, we compare its predictions against the results from direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) and, when available, against experimental measurements. We use C 1 quadratic B-spline basis functions to represent the smooth geometry of the sinusoidal lower wall and the solution variables. The Reynolds numbers of the flows considered are 6760 and 30, 000 based on the bulk velocity and average channel height. The ratio of amplitude to wavelength (α/λ) of the sinusoidal <b>wavy</b> surface is <b>set</b> to 0. 05. The computational domain is 2 λ× 1. 05 λ×λ in the streamwise, wall-normal and spanwise directions, respectively. For the Re= 6760 case, mean averaged quantities, including velocity and pressure profiles, and the separation/reattachment points in the recirculation region, are compared with DNS and experimental data. The turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stress are in good agreement with benchmark data. Coherent structures over the wavy wall are observed in isosurfaces of the Q-criterion and show similar features to those previously reported in the literature. Comparable accuracy to DNS solutions is obtained {{with at least one}} order of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom. For the Re= 30, 000 case, good agreement was obtained for mean wall shear stress and velocity profiles compared with available LES results reported in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
