5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel Balāṭa.|$|E

25|$|The Indians admit {{a loss of}} 140 killed, {{besides a}} heavy loss of wounded. This, with the Indian prisoners <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> our possession, makes the entire loss of the Indian in killed, wounded, and missing not far from 300.|$|E

25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.|$|E
25|$|Although the Latin {{original}} has {{not come}} down to us, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the Actus B. Francisci et Sociorum Ejus, edited by Paul Sabatier in Collection d’Études (Paris, 1902, IV), an approximation to it which may be considered on the whole as representing the original of the Fioretti. That Ugolino was the principal compiler of the Actus seems certain; how far he may be considered the sole author of the Fioretti is not so clear. His labour, which consisted chiefly in gathering the flowers for his bouquet from written and oral local tradition, {{appears to have been}} completed before 1328.|$|E
25|$|Many {{men went}} bareheaded and, {{apart from the}} Emperor, they were {{normally}} so in votive depictions, which may distort the record <b>we</b> <b>have.</b> <b>In</b> the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress {{is one of many}} things he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 in {{the last days of the}} Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide brimmed felt hat came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, small caps with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, {{as part of}} a Liverpool council delegation, the Braddocks {{visited the}} Soviet Union at the {{invitation}} of the mayor of Odessa, a city with which Liverpool had informal fraternal links. Her overall impression of the country was of drabness and oppression, with welfare provision generally well below British levels, although she conceded that medical facilities were excellent.

[...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things." [...] Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, [...] "At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1902 rugby season in May, Verge was up for {{selection}} to the University first XV, either at fullback or threequarter, and also for NSW as fullback. He took the place at fullback on the University XV from A. J. McKenzie. By June 1902, Verge was gaining recognition in the press. The Referee reported: [...] "Verge, as full back, deserves a special word of praise for quickness and all-round ability: he has steadily improved until he now may be compared with any man <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the position. And he is likely to still further improve." [...] After a lacklustre performance by John Maund at fullback in the first inter-state match between NSW and Queensland, Verge gained his first cap for NSW in the return match on 19 July 1902 at University Oval, Sydney.|$|E

500|$|Morton {{once again}} {{called for a}} series of reforms, repeating those from 1840, and {{including}} a proposal to transfer the tax burden from real to personal property. [...] He was criticized by the Whigs for omitting any mention of slavery in his inaugural address. [...] During his term the leaders of the various Democratic factions squabbled over executive and party appointments, and the death of President William Henry Harrison shortly after taking office brought on further party divisions as potential presidential nominees canvassed the state for support. [...] As a consequence, much of the reform agenda was either not implemented at all, or only minimally, despite a nominally working Democratic-Liberty coalition majority in the legislature. [...] George Bancroft bemoaned the lost opportunity: [...] "Never had a party a better opening than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Massachusetts, if all would but profit by our position. [...] But they will not." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his announcement, a {{campaign}} began in Argentina for Messi {{to change his}} mind about retiring. He was greeted by fans with signs like [...] "Don't go, Leo" [...] when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, [...] "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have {{the best player in the}} world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Argentina and we must take care of him." [...] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him reconsider retirement. On social networks, NoTeVayasLeo became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on Spotify. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.|$|E
500|$|When the emissaries {{returned}} to Buenos Aires, {{the government was}} worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With {{the signing of the}} Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. [...] "In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, but I think he is the best <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> South America".|$|E
