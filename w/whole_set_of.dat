40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} quality {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> rules extracted from data, as a counterpart to {{more commonly used}} measures of individual rules.

Then three particular approaches to extending ruleset quality measures from classification to general rulesets are discussed. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification rulesets on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, the approach is illustrated on rulesets extracted with four important rules extraction methods from the well-known iris data...|$|R

25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, the cooperatives {{had very}} mixed success; {{and the majority}} were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s. The conversions were authorized in 1980 by changes in the basic land reform legislation and were put into effect after majority votes of the cooperative members in each case. The preferences {{of the people involved}} at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform. But the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform agrarian structure. In fact, the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{colonies of}} insects such as ants and bees, {{researchers}} are modeling {{the behavior of}} swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex. The <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> robots {{can be considered as}} one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism, exhibiting swarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors. Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} quality {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> rules extracted from data, as a counterpart to {{more commonly used}} measures of individual rules. This research has been motivated by increasingly frequent extraction of non-classification rules, such as association rules and rules of observational logic, in real-world data mining tasks. The paer sketches the typology of rules extraction methods and of their rulesets, and recalls that quality measures for <b>whole</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> rules have been so far used only {{in the case of}} classification rulesets. It then proposes three possible ways how such measures can be extended to general rulesets. The paper also recalls the possibility to measure the dependence of classification ruleset on parameters of the classification method by means of ROC curves, and proposes a generalization of ROC curves to general rulesets. Finally, a brief illustration on rulesets extracted by means of the method GUHA is given. ...|$|R

25|$|Texas Instruments v. Fairchild: In {{their legal}} wars, Texas Instruments {{focused on their}} largest and most technologically {{advanced}} competitor, Fairchild Semiconductor. Their cases hindered not the production at Fairchild, but the sale of licenses for their technologies. By 1965, the planar technology of Fairchild became the industry standard, but the license to patents of Hoerni and Noyce was purchased by less than ten manufacturers, {{and there were no}} mechanisms to pursue unlicensed production. Similarly, the key patents of Kilby were bringing no income to Texas Instruments. In 1964, the patent arbitration awarded Texas Instruments the rights to four of the five key provisions of the contested patents, but both companies appealed the decision. The litigation could continue for years, if not the defeat of Texas Instruments in the dispute with Sprague in April 1966. Texas Instruments realized that they could not claim priority for the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> key IC patents, and lost interest in the patent war. In the summer of 1966, Texas Instruments and Fairchild agreed on the mutual recognition of patents and cross-licensing of key patents; in 1967 they were joined by Sprague.|$|E

These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, {{it was important to}} be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, [...] "so you can talk about their interaction and the <b>whole</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> issues that arise from those two things being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him [...] "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".|$|E

[...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas {{for all of us}} involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen.
