About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E

It is {{wonderful}} enough, that our brains should hear through our ears, and see through our eyes: but it is more wonderful still, that {{they should be able to}} recollect what they have heard and seen. That you and I should be able to call up in our minds a sound which we heard yesterday, or even a minute ago, is to me one of the most utterly astonishing things I know of. And so of ordinary recollection. What is it that we call remembering a place, remembering a person's face? That place, or that face, was actually printed, as it were, through our eye upon our brain. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of it somewhere; we know not where, inside us. But that we should be able to call that picture up again, and look at it with what we rightly call our mind's eye, whenever we choose; and not merely that one picture only, but thousands of such;--that is a wonder, indeed, which passes understanding. Consider the hundreds of human faces, the hundreds of different things and places, which you can recollect; and then consider that all those different pictures are lying, as it were, over each other in hundreds in that small place, your brain, for the most part without interfering with, or rubbing out each other, each ready to be called up, recollected, and used in its turn.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> {{of him in}} this fatal month. Diderot went to pay him a visit (Dec. 5). Rousseau {{was alone}} {{at the bottom of}} his garden. As soon as he saw Diderot, he cried in a voice of thunder and with his eyes all aflame: [...] "What have you come here for?" [...] "I want to know whether you are mad or {{malicious}}." [...] "You have known me for fifteen years; you are well aware how little malicious I am, and I will prove to you that I am not mad: follow me." [...] He then drew Diderot into a room, and proceeded to clear himself, by means of letters, of the charge of trying to make a breach between Saint Lambert and Madame d'Houdetot. They were in fact letters that convicted him, as we know, of trying to persuade Madame d'Houdetot of the criminality of her relations with her lover, {{and at the same time}} to accept himself in the very same relation. Of all this we have heard more than enough already. He was stubborn in the face of Diderot's remonstrance, and the latter left him in a state which he described in a letter to Grimm the same night. [...] "I throw myself into your arms, like one who has had a shock of fright: that man intrudes into my work; he fills me with trouble, and I am as if I had a damned soul at my side. May I never see him again; he would make me believe in devils and hell."[317] And thus the unhappy man who had began this episode in his life with confident ecstasy in the glories and clear music of spring, ended it looking out from a narrow chamber upon the sullen crimson of the wintry twilight and over fields silent in snow, with the haggard desperate gaze of a lost spirit.|$|E
5000|$|Of course, the foci of the teleosemantic {{program is}} {{internal}} representations, {{and not just}} representational states of affairs between two (or more) distinct, external entities. How does {{the picture of the}} producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations? Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying [...] "The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations." [...] The consuming mechanisms are those that [...] "use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end". [...] Here, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system. One sub-function produces mental representations while the other sub-function consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition. The representations consumed by the consumer sub-function guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival. This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait. Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation. But that is a matter of how. Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place.|$|E

Notwithstanding the {{enormous}} personal and family emotional costs, and the great financial costs, suicide is a significant concern for the criminal justice system.

More precisely we show that one does not obtain the 3 -type of S 2. The basic reason is that the Whitehead bracket is nonzero.
