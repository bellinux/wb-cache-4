5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> thermostats.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{recently}} completed a rulemaking process in which it amended the existing energy efficiency standards for residential <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> A key factor in DOE?s consideration of new standards is the economic impacts on consumers. Determining such impacts requires {{a comparison of the}} additional first cost of energy efficiency design options with the savings in operating costs. This paper describes the method used to conduct the life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback period analysis for gas and electric storage <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> It presents the estimated change in LCC associated with more energy-efficient equipment, including heat pump electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and condensing gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> for a representative sample of U. S. homes. The study included a detailed accounting of installation costs for the considered design options, with a focus on approaches for accommodating the larger dimensions of more efficient <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> For heat pump <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> the study also considered airflow requirements, venting issues, and the impact of these products on the indoor environment. The results indicate that efficiency improvement relative to the baseline design reduces the LCC in the majority of homes for both gas and electric storage <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> and heat pump electric <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and condensing gas <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> provide a lower LCC for homes with large rated volume <b>water</b> <b>heaters...</b>|$|R

25|$|The basic {{trick in}} a solar water heating {{system is to}} use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are vacuum- insulated, acting {{something}} like large thermos bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} often {{employed}} for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much {{more efficiently than}} air, {{which means that the}} diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an evacuated tube solar hot <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E

Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying.

Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.|$|E
