25|$|The way Kant {{suggests}} that we should deal with this dialectic is through {{an appeal to the}} two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free,</b> whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.|$|E
25|$|This {{thesis of}} {{negative}} capability {{is a key}} component in Unger's theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, {{and there is no}} necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.|$|E
25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists, namely, that if the world is deterministic then, our feeling that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to choose an action is simply an illusion. Metaphysical libertarianism is the form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will). This view is associated with non-materialist constructions, including both traditional dualism, as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; {{such as the ability}} to consciously veto an action or competing desire. Yet even with physical indeterminism, arguments have been made against libertarianism in {{that it is difficult to}} assign Origination (responsibility for [...] "free" [...] indeterministic choices).|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, Hensen and {{co-workers}} {{reported that they}} performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject {{at least one of}} the principles of locality, realism, or freedom-of-choice (the last [...] "could" [...] lead to alternative superdeterministic theories). Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as [...] "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.|$|E

[...] The Brotherhood reported on living conditions: the main concerns and worries of the black population; even publishing the letters of people of color who wrote in about their misfortunes and experiences.

2500|$|In {{choosing}} the surface Σ(t), the restrictions are that (i) {{it has to}} be bounded by a closed curve around which the EMF is to be found, and (ii) it has to capture the relative motion of all moving parts of the circuit. It is emphatically not required that the bounding curve corresponds to a physical line of flow of the current. On the other hand, induction is all about relative motion, and the path emphatically must capture any relative motion. In a case like Figure 1 where a portion of the current path is distributed over a region in space, the EMF driving the current can be found using a variety of paths. Figure 2 shows two possibilities. All paths include the obvious return loop, but in the disc two paths are shown: one is a geometrically simple path, the other a tortuous one. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to choose whatever path we like, but a portion of any acceptable path is fixed in the disc itself and turns with the disc. The flux is calculated though the entire path, return loop plus disc segment, [...] and its rate-of change found.|$|E
2500|$|If two {{translations}} are parallel, we can {{slide the}} mirror pair {{of the second}} translation to cancel the inner mirror of the sequence of four, much as in the rotation case. Thus the composition of two parallel translations produces a translation by {{the sum of the}} distances in the same direction. Now suppose the translations are not parallel, and that the mirror sequence is A1, A2 (the first translation) followed by B1, B2 (the second). Then A2 and B1 must cross, say at c; and, reassociating, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> to pivot this inner pair around c. If we pivot 90°, an interesting thing happens: now A1 and A2 intersect at a 90° angle, say at p, and so do B1 and B2, say at q. Again reassociating, we pivot the first pair around p to make B2 pass through q, and pivot the second pair around q to make A1 pass through p. The inner mirrors now coincide and cancel, and the outer mirrors are left parallel. Thus the composition of two non-parallel translations also produces a translation. Also, the three pivot points form a triangle whose edges give the head-to-tail rule of vector addition: 2(p c) + 2(c q) = 2(p q). ∎ ...|$|E
