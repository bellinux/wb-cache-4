40|$|The Stirling engine {{possesses}} numerous natural {{benefits such as}} functioning {{from any}} heat source, quiet operation, and high theoretical efficiency. The limited success of Stirling engines has been partially due to the near-adiabatic operation in the <b>working</b> <b>chambers,</b> necessitating external heat exchangers that add dead space, difficulty sealing low-molecular weight gases at high pressure, and non-ideal piston displacement profiles. As a solution to these difficulties, a liquid piston is proposed that allows the compression and expansion chambers to be designed for a high heat transfer rate. The heat transfer in these chambers can be increased through geometry changes, allowable by {{the ability of a}} liquid column to fill an irregular volume. Through a simplistic example, it is demonstrated that a liquid piston can improve the heat transfer rate in the <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> by 3. 5 orders of magnitude over a conventional piston. Creating near-isothermal operation in the <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> eliminates the need for costly external heat exchangers, while creating a secondary path to transfer heat {{in and out of the}} chamber through the liquid. The elimination of the external heat exchangers decreases the dead space in the engine, increasing power and efficiency. The liquid piston also eliminates sealing a gas with sliding seals. Finally, the displacement of the liquid pistons can be carefully controlled in a number of ways to closely match the ideal Stirling cycle. I...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To obtain {{experimentally}} {{that the}} duration of the high-voltage pulse front is less than 1. 5 nanoseconds on the load of a pulse voltage generator of less than 50 ohms in the form of more than two <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> with a water-containing product. That increases the efficiency of disinfection of treated products. Methodology. To obtain high-voltage pulses in <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> - the generator load - the pulse generation method was used according to the Arkadyev-Marx scheme. The pulses on the load were measured with a low-ohm resistive voltage divider, transmitted over a broadband coaxial cable, and recorded using a C 7 - 19 oscilloscope with a 5 GHz bandwidth. The <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> were filled with water and consisted of an annular body made of PTFE 4 and metal electrodes forming the bottom and the chamber cover having flat linings of food stainless steel for contact with the food product inside the chamber. Results. The high-voltage pulses on the generator load of about 50 Ohm or less have a trapezoidal shape with a rounded apex and a base duration of no more than 80 ns. The experimentally obtained pulse amplitudes on the generator load are up to 18 kV. As the load resistance decreases, the amplitude of the pulses decreases, and {{the duration of}} the front and pulse duration in general are shortened because of the accelerated discharge of cascade capacitive storages. Originality. For the first time we have obtained experimentally on the load of the generator in the form of three parallel <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> with water, the active resistance of each of which is less than 50 Ohm, the pulse front duration tf≈ 1 ns. In addition, we have obtained experimentally a stable 9 - 10 channel triggering mode of the trigatron type spark gap in a five-cascade pulse voltage generator with a step-by-step peaking (exacerbation) of the pulse front in its cascades (GPVCP). Practical value. We have obtained experimentally the nanosecond pulse front duration on the GPVCP load and that opens the prospect of industrial application of such generators for microbiologically disinfecting treatment (inactivation of microorganisms in food) water-containing food products...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed inner gear rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and gate rotors in a conventional screw machine) creates a series of separate <b>working</b> <b>chambers.</b> In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of ported end plates is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the <b>working</b> <b>chambers</b> of the internally geared screw machine. As with conventional screw machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications.

500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] {{to lose sight of}} Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|E
500|$|Lützow {{scored a}} second hit {{a minute later}} at 16:52. Eight minutes later, Lion scored the first hit on Lützow; a salvo from the British ship struck the battlecruiser on her forecastle, but no major damage was done. These two hits {{would prove to be}} very important, however, as Lützow took on more water due to damage {{sustained}} later in the battle, since they allowed water to enter the ship above the armored deck. Nearly simultaneously, Lützow dealt a tremendous blow to Lion; one of her 30.5cm shells penetrated the roof of Lions center [...] "Q" [...] turret and detonated the munitions that were stored inside. Only by the resolute actions of the turret commander—Major Francis Harvey, who ordered the magazine be flooded—did the ship avoid a catastrophic magazine explosion. Indeed, approximately 30 minutes after the turret was destroyed, the fire in the turret spread to the <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> that was directly above the magazine; there it detonated propellant charges that had been stored there. The resulting explosion would have likely destroyed the ship if the ammunition magazine had not been flooded.|$|E
500|$|Seydlitz {{participated in}} many of the large fleet actions during the First World War, {{including}} the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea. The ship suffered severe damage during both engagements; during the Battle of Dogger Bank, a 13.5in (34.3cm) shell from the British battlecruiser [...] struck Seydlitzs rearmost turret and nearly caused a magazine explosion that could have destroyed the ship. At the Battle of Jutland she was hit 21 times by heavy caliber shells, one of which penetrated the <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> of the aft superfiring turret. Although the resulting fire destroyed the turret, the safety measures imposed after the battle of Dogger Bank prevented a catastrophe. The ship was also hit by a torpedo during the battle, causing her to take in over 5,300metric tons of water and her freeboard was reduced to 2.5m. She had to be lightened significantly to permit her crossing of the Jade Bar. The ship inflicted severe damage on her British opponents as well; early in the battle, salvos from both Seydlitz and [...] destroyed the battlecruiser [...] in seconds.|$|E

500|$|The Königs {{were armed}} with a main battery of ten [...] SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. Two turrets were mounted forward of the main {{superstructure}} in a superfiring pair, the third {{was placed on the}} centerline between the two funnels amidships, and the fourth and fifth turrets were also arranged in a superfiring pair, aft of the rear conning tower. Each gun turret had a <b>working</b> <b>chamber</b> beneath it that was connected to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below it. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In an effort to reduce the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. The centerline arrangement was an improvement over the preceding , as all ten guns could fire on a wide arc on the broadside, and four guns could fire directly ahead, as opposed to only two on the Kaisers. The guns were supplied with 900 rounds, or 90 shells per gun. The 30.5cm gun had a rate of fire of between 2–3 405.5-kilogram (894-pound) armor-piercing shells per minute, and was expected to fire 200 shells before replacement was necessary. The guns were also capable of firing 405.9kg (894.8lb) high explosive shells. Both types of shells were loaded with two propellant charges: an RP C/12 main charge in a brass cartridge that weighed 91kg (201lb) and an RP C/12 fore charge in a silk bag that weighed 34.5kg (76lb). This provided a muzzle velocity of 855meters per second (2,805ft/s). The turrets on the König-class battleships initially allowed elevation up to 13.5degrees; this enabled a maximum range of 16,200m (17,700yd).
