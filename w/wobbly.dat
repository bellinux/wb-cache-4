Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E

50|$|The Industrial Workers of the World union, {{also known}} as the IWW or the <b>Wobblies,</b> was founded in 1905.

The <b>Wobblies</b> showed up in Oregon around the 1907 in logging and millworkers, and they found their center in Portland. The <b>Wobblies</b> were the scandalous group in Portland at the time, because their leader was accused of murder making other unions distance themselves from them.|$|R

The crowd remained peaceful and sang <b>Wobbly</b> songs through the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|The visible star's {{position}} is carefully measured and detected to vary, {{due to the}} gravitational influence from its counterpart. The position of the star is repeatedly measured relative to more distant stars, and then checked for periodic shifts in position. Typically this type of measurement can only be performed on nearby stars, such as those within 10 parsecs. Nearby stars often have a relatively high proper motion, so astrometric binaries will appear to follow a <b>wobbly</b> path across the sky.|$|E
25|$|Hill's {{body was}} sent to Chicago where it was cremated.

However, {{it was not until the}} first anniversary of his death (November 19, 1916) that delegates attending the Tenth Convention of the IWW in Chicago received envelopes. The rest of the 600 envelopes were sent to IWW locals, Wobblies and sympathizers around the world on January 3, 1917.|$|E

50|$|After {{the passage}} of free speech restrictions, the <b>Wobblies</b> and other groups began testing the ordinance. At a typical IWW street meeting the police left the <b>Wobblies</b> {{undisturbed}} and merely relegated themselves to traffic and pedestrian direction. Indeed, the <b>Wobblies</b> and the Socialists believed that they had already won back their free speech rights. But law enforcement was simply adhering to a generally accepted 30-day grace period after the ordinance was enacted. Once the grace period was over, forty-one people were arrested during a parade and demonstration consisting of 5,000 protesters. Those arrested were jailed for twenty-four hours, held initially on a misdemeanor charge. But the prosecutors decided the violators had conspired to break the law, and thus tried the prisoners under a felony charge of conspiracy. The <b>Wobblies</b> and other soapbox speakers then moved their orations out of the restricted zone. But the council passed an ordinance which gave police the ability to arrest anyone that disrupted traffic throughout San Diego.|$|R

DD started their <b>wobbly</b> innings with David Warner cheaply gone for 1 run and wickets continued to fall in short intervals. DD succumbed to a meager 83. This could be considered {{as one of the}} worst performances of DD and they have to win 9 of the next 10 games they have ahead of them.|$|E
25|$|The owners {{quickly turned}} public opinion against the AFL. As the strike began, they {{published}} information exposing AFL National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster's radical {{past as a}} <b>Wobbly</b> and syndicalist, and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by radicals and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting {{that a large number}} of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. State and local authorities backed the steel companies. They prohibited mass meetings, had their police attack pickets and jailed thousands. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in Gary, Indiana, the U.S. Army took over the city on October 6, 1919, and martial law was declared. National guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby Indiana Harbor, Indiana.|$|E
25|$|During summer, the old hill had a lake, {{which made}} it {{possible}} to use the amphitheater for concerts, plays and entertainment. The venue was then often referred to as Sommerkollen. From 1963, a temporary, small in-run was built down the southern grandstand, which allowed skiers and divers to make a jump and land in the water. Between 1963 and 1983, a competition was held nine times. Starting in 1983 was Ta sjansen, which was televised annually by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and became Sommerkollen's most popular show. It was an informal competition with two main events: one where a home-made craft was to first slide down a short in-run and then slide along the water surface to hit a mounted bell in the shortest possible time. The other was a cycling competition where the cyclist had to complete a track on a <b>wobbly</b> floating wharf.|$|E

25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and <b>wobbly,</b> so the team went {{back to the drawing board}} where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E
25|$|The IWW first {{attracted}} {{attention in}} Goldfield, Nevada in 1906 {{and during the}} Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. The town of Spokane, Washington had outlawed street meetings, and arrested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a <b>Wobbly</b> organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, {{large numbers of people}} descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town. In Spokane, over 500 people went to jail and four people died. The tactic of fighting for free speech to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in Fresno, Aberdeen, and other locations. In San Diego, although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen mounted a particularly brutal counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|Now up 14-0 with 9:25 left in {{the second}} quarter, Washington squandered {{multiple}} chances to build a 3-score lead. A blitz from Washington cornerback A. J. Johnson caused Miller to throw a <b>wobbly</b> pass that was intercepted by Martin Mayhew on the Falcons 29-yard line. But after driving to the 10, Rypien returned the favor with an interception to Atlanta safety Brian Jordan. The Redskins quickly got another chance to score due to an interception by linebacker Kurt Gouveia, but this drive also ended with no points, due to a missed 37-yard field goal attempt from Chip Lohmiller. Atlanta then drove 80 yards to score on Tracy Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run with 57 seconds {{left in the}} half, while Lohmiller missed a 44-yard field goal attempt as time in the second quarter ran out, his third miss of the day. So despite three first half turnovers, Atlanta went into their locker room trailing only 14-7.|$|E
