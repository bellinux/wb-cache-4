This work describes the energy consumption model, which includes the properties of periodic loads common for any type of the processing industry. Therefore it can be employed for all the branches of industry, <b>working</b> with time <b>tariffs.</b> The paper proposes the principle of hourly rate setting and forecasting energy consumption for complex industrial facilities. The hourly chart of equipment load of the iron and steel plant's melting shop is designed in accordance with the proposed principle. The designed chart has been evaluated based on the index of the energy consumption cost reduction...|$|R

More than 1, 000 of these organizations provide water to 60 % of the rural population and show great disparity in their performances. Using a qualitative approach and matching techniques to ensure comparability, the paper analyzes four representative communities. The results highlight the relevance of a demand-driven approach with downward accountability, <b>working</b> rules for <b>tariff</b> collection and infrastructure maintenance, and attributes of water committee members as the chief conditions that promote better financial health, infrastructure condition and user satisfaction. common-pool resources institutions social-ecological systems Central America Costa Rica...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an institutional {{analysis of the}} underlying factors affecting the performance of drinking-water community organizations in rural areas of Costa Rica. These organizations provide water to more than 60 {{percent of the total}} rural population. There is, however, a great disparity in their performance. This research tries to understand how a complex configuration of geophysical characteristics of watersheds and infrastructure as well as governance and socioeconomic attributes of local users affects three key dimensions of performance in rural communities: financial health, infrastructure condition, and user satisfaction. Using a qualitative approach and matching techniques to ensure comparability, the paper analyzes four communities in depth. The main results highlight the relevance of a demand-driven approach, coupled with local accountability, <b>working</b> rules for <b>tariff</b> collection and infrastructure maintenance, and appropriate support from the government as the main conditions that promote higher levels of performance. institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework, social ecological system (SES), propensity score matching...|$|R
50|$|Bangladesh {{is third}} largest trade partner of China in South Asia. But, the {{bilateral}} trade {{between them is}} highly tilted in favour of Beijing. Bilateral trade reached as high as US$3.19 billion in 2006, reflecting a growth of 28.5% between 2005 and 2006. China has bolstered its economic aid to Bangladesh to address concerns of trade imbalance; in 2006, Bangladesh's exports to China amounted only about USD 98.8 million. Under {{the auspices of the}} Asia-Pacific Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), China removed tariff barriers to 84 types of commodities imported from Bangladesh and is <b>working</b> to reduce <b>tariffs</b> over the trade of jute and textiles, which are Bangladesh's chief domestic products. China has also offered to construct nuclear power plants in Bangladesh to help meet the country's growing energy needs, while also seeking to aid the development of Bangladesh's natural gas resources. China's mainly imports raw materials from Bangladesh like leather, cotton textiles, fish, etc. China's major exports to Bangladesh include textiles, machinery and electronic products, cement, fertiliser, tyre, raw silk, maize, etc.|$|R

As renewable energy is fundamental to achieving all of these objectives, it too needs the best possible policy to drive it. Feed-in tariffs have proven to deliver the fastest, most cost-effective and inclusive deployment, by allowing anyone to sell renewable energy into the grid and get a long term, guaranteed return for it. This book, from authors who have spent years <b>working</b> on feed-in <b>tariff</b> design and advocacy, provides a broad and detailed resource on feed-in tariffs and other renewable energy support schemes. It shares many lessons on good and bad design and implementation, as well as discussing the challenges faced by policy, and renewable energy in general. Powering the Green Economy: - Situates renewable energy and feed-in tariffs {{within the context of}} the global moves towards a green economy - Provides an introduction to feed-in tariffs and brings developments in key countries around the world up to date - Investigates effective design for developed and emerging economies - Explores technical, social and political issues - Analyses other support schemes - Describes the barriers to renewable energy - Presents a blueprint for campaigning successfully for feed-in tariffs Written in a clear, practical style, this is a must-read for policymakers, businesses, investors, campaigners, academics, community groups and anyone concerned with creating successful and sustainable energy policy...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case study}} on a {{cigarette}} company of HF. Prima Malang with the title “The Analysis of Production Expense to Produce High productive effectiveness and efficiency on A cigarette company of HF. Prima. This study aims at finding out the analysis of production expense to produce high productive effectiveness and efficiency on a cigarette company of HF Prima Malang. This study uses the gap index analysis by using the three models of gap analysis as a productive control. The controlling level to determine the productive expense {{can be said to}} be effective if there is a gap account which benefit the expense standard of its real income. The result of its analysis of those three models during the year of 2005 - 2007 for the raw material price is considered not efficient since the gap account is not beneficial. The price gap is controlled by the market. In terms of its raw material quantity we can see the gap account so {{it can be said that}} there is a benefit on it so it is considered to be efficient and effective and is under control. The gap account on in the combination of its price and its quantity can not be found which means that there is no full responsibility shown by those two managers. The wage is not efficient since we can not find the gap account between the workers expense and its wage rate. The raise on the worker’s wage is influenced by economic condition and the marker condition as well.. there is a gap on its wage which seems that it is efficient enough but in terms of its combination there is no good gap which means that there is no effectiveness and efficiency yet and this shows that that there is no responsibility from the two management. The overhead of its company in terms of its expense, it has the same efficiency so we get benefit from it. The gap of BOP capacity in the year of 2006 shows the significant raise, but in 200 and 2007 has an unfavorable gap so that the capacity of its BOP is not effective and this show that the company still can not control the company well. These are all shows that the overall performance of the company show the gap of its productive and this one is very beneficial and it is considered effective and efficient along with its effective standard. But the company needs to ay attention on its raw material price, the <b>working</b> wage <b>tariff,</b> the direct workers wages and the overhead capacity which is still considered uncontrollable so it causes the the unfavorable gap...|$|R
