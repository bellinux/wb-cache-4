The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E

25|$|On November 14, about 350 {{students}} {{gathered in}} front of Maha Bandula Park in downtown Yangon to stage a protest against the National Education Law. The students also later held subsequent protests at Yangon University and Shwedagon Pagoda. Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the fight to reform National Education Law. He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is {{the formation of a}} National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students’ opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education. The protest also coincided with United States President Barack Obama’s second visit to Yangon although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional. He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education. The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a quadripartite meeting with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students’ concerns. On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn’t respond within the deadline.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, Warner {{surprised}} many industry observers when {{he purchased}} {{the rights to}} Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage. [...] From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit. [...] Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him [...] "uneasy". [...] "I was uncomfortable {{with the thought that}} this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," [...] Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. [...] These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an [...] "Adults only" [...] label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. [...] It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 March 1932, Puyi was {{installed}} by the Japanese as the Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a puppet {{state of the}} Empire of Japan, under the reign title Datong (Wade-Giles: Ta-tung; 大同). Puyi believed Manchukuo <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> {{and within a few}} years time, he would once again reign as the Emperor of China, having the yellow Imperial Dragon robes used for coronation of Qing emperors brought from Beijing to Changchun. At the time, Japanese propaganda depicted the birth of Manchukuo as a triumph of Pan-Asian feelings with the [...] "five races" [...] of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus and Mongols coming together, which marked nothing less than the birth of a new civilization and a turning point in world history. A press statement issued on 1 March 1932 stated: [...] "The glorious advent of Manchukuo with {{the eyes of the world}} turned on it was an epochal event of far-reaching consequence in world history, marking the birth of a new era in government, racial relations, and other affairs of general interest. Never in the chronicles of the human race was any State born with such high ideals, and never has any State accomplished so much in such a brief space of its existence as Manchukuo".|$|E
2500|$|Itagaki {{suggested}} to Puyi {{that in a}} few years time Manchukuo might become a monarchy and stated that Manchuria <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> as Japan had ambitions to take all of China; the obvious implication was that Puyi would become the Great Qing Emperor again. When Puyi objected to Itagaki's plans, he was told that he was in no position to negotiate as Itagaki had no interest in his opinions on these issues. Unlike Doihara, who was always very polite and constantly stroked Puyi's ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, addressing Puyi like he was barking out orders to a particularly dim-witted common soldier. Puyi's chief adviser Zheng Xiaoxu had been promised by Itagaki that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity sufficiently enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself, as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644. In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian [...] "Sage King" [...] out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who was going to end the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.|$|E
