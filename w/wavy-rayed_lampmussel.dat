50|$|Lampsilis fasciola, {{common name}} the <b>Wavy-rayed</b> <b>Lampmussel,</b> is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Unionidae, the river mussels.|$|E
50|$|The lower Maitland (to Wingham) has a {{trout and}} salmon run, and {{is home to}} several species at risk {{including}} Queen snake, <b>Wavy-rayed</b> <b>Lampmussel</b> and Butternut tree, {{as well as several}} Carolinian forest species, including Bitternut hickory, American Sycamore, Summer grape and Green dragon.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{fresh water}} mussels, the <b>Wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussel</b> is {{extremely}} sensitive {{to changes in}} water quality. This includes chemical contaminants entering its habitat such as copper, ammonia and chloride, particularly during their glochidial and juvenile life phases. This, along with loss of habitat has caused a continuous decrease in the mussel's populations. Additionally, {{the introduction of the}} invasive Zebra Mussel has resulted in even greater reductions in population. By affixing themselves to hard surfaces the zebra mussels are in direct competition with wavy-rayed lampmussels, and impair their ability to feed, reproduce and move.Smaller population may also be affected by predation by muskrats. Like other mussels, other threats to the <b>wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussel</b> include: natural flow alterations, siltation, channel disturbance, point and non-point source pollution, and exotic species (including the aforementioned zebra mussel). Maintenance or establishment of vegetated riparian buffers can help protect mussel habitats from many of their threats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussels</b> are {{historically}} {{distributed throughout}} Southern Ontario {{as well as}} 13 U.S. States including the Ohio watershed. In Ontario the mussel has been confirmed in at least four watersheds: the Ausable, Grand, Maitland and Thames river. Mussels live in gravel and sand bottoms in medium-sized streams but are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment. [...] Typically the mussels are found in streams with good currents, and near to riffles, and are rarely found in medium-sized rivers.Like many mussels, the larvae of this species are parasitic and affix themselves to fish hosts. At this stage the larvae consume nutrients from the fish body until they develop into juvenile mussels, and drop off. Fish hosts used by the Wavy Rayed Lampmussel include the Largemouth Bass and the Smallmouth Bass. These fish hosts are especially important to ensure healthy mussel populations.|$|R
5000|$|The Canadian Species at Risk Act listed {{it in the}} List of Wildlife Species at Risk {{as being}} {{endangered}} in Canada. [...] In 2010 {{the status of the}} <b>wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussel</b> was reassessed for downgrading due to increased populations. Currently it is listed as [...] "Special Concern" [...] under SARA, as of March 2013, and [...] "Special Concern" [...] under COSEWIC, as of April 2010.|$|E
50|$|Hay Swamp is {{situated}} at the northern limit of the Carolinian Biotic Province and is categorized as consisting of 98% swamp and 2% marshland. Apart from the Ausable and the Black, its primary source of water {{is considered to be}} the local Wyoming Moraine aquifer. Hay Swamp is an important regional habitat for wildlife populations including white-tailed deer, great blue heron, ducks, geese, as well as a significant beaver presence. The swamp is also home to several plant species at risk, including green dragon and Riddell's goldenrod. Endangered fish and mussel species present in Hay Swamp include, eastern sand darter, greenside darter, northern riffleshell, snuffbox, <b>wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussel,</b> rainbow mussel and kidneyshell.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wavy-rayed</b> <b>Lampmussel</b> is a {{relatively}} small mussel distributed throughout Southern Ontario and the North-Eastern sections of the United States. The mussel is characterized by its yellow to yellowish-green colour. The mussel receives {{its name from the}} numerous thin wavy rays that cover its shell. These waves can be thin and separate or coalesced into significantly wider rays. The beak is slightly elevated above the hinge lines and the beak sculpture consists of 3 to 5 wavy lines. The shell is compressed to inflated (females) in shape and the anterior end is rounded with the posterior end bluntly pointed in males and rounded in females. The mussel's nacre is typically white or bluish, and the shell in general is rounded and generally symmetrical over the axis. The shell is mostly smooth, excepting certain wrinkles and growth rests that may appear. Wavy-rayed Lampmussles are typically less than 75mm, but have been known to grow up to 90-100mm in length.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to develop methods for conducting chronic toxicity tests with juvenile mussels under flow-through conditions and to determine the chronic toxicity of copper and ammonia to juvenile mussels using these methods. In two feeding tests, two-month-old fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea) and rainbow mussel (Villosa iris) were fed various live algae or nonviable algal mixture for 28 d. The algal mixture was the best food resulting in high survival (90 %) and growth. Multiple copper and ammonia toxicity tests were conducted for 28 d starting with two-month-old mussels. Six toxicity tests using the algal mixture were successfully completed with a control survival of 88 to 100 %. Among copper tests with rainbow mussel, fatmucket, and oyster mussel (Epioblasma capsaeformis), chronic value ([ChV], geometric mean of the no-observed-effect con-centration and the lowest-observed-effect concentration) ranged from 8. 5 to 9. 8 g Cu/L for survival and from 4. 6 to 8. 5 g Cu/L for growth. Among ammonia tests with rainbow mussel, fatmucket, and <b>wavy-rayed</b> <b>lampmussel</b> (L. fasciola), the ChV ranged from 0. 37 to 1. 2 mg total ammonia N/L for survival and from 0. 37 to 0. 67 mg N/L for growth. These ChVs were below the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 1996 chronic water quality criterion (WQC) for copper (15 g/L; hardness 170 mg/L) and 199...|$|E
