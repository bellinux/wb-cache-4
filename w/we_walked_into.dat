In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> John's house, we didn't know what to expect, and we {{get in there and}} the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is in the kitchen and the piano is over there. And he's so nonchalant about all his stuff — there'd be a triple-platinum Dave Matthews Band plaque sticking out from under the bed." [...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E

2500|$|Comăneci {{was chosen}} to {{participate}} in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, a city {{that was part of the}} Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Union) at that time. As a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would boycott the Olympics (several other countries also participated in the boycott, though the reasons varied). According to Comăneci, the Romanian government [...] "touted the 1980 Olympic games as the first all-Communist Games." [...] However, she also noted in her memoir, [...] "in Moscow, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the mouth of a lion's den; it was the Russians' home turf." [...] She went on to win two gold medals, one for the balance beam and one for the floor exercise (in which she tied with Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim, against whom she also competed [...] in the 1976 Montreal Olympics). She also won two silver medals, one for the team all-around and one for individual all-around. Controversies arose concerning the scoring in the all-around and floor exercise competitions. Her coach, Bela Károlyi, protested that she was scored unfairly. His protests were captured on television, however, causing him to fall out of favor with members of the Romanian government, who felt that he had humiliated them. Life thus became very difficult for Károlyi from that point forward.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907 Alfred Richardson {{received}} an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: [...] "Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward. JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E

For example, rather than treating every built architectural structure as being a unique construction, we form equivalence classes such as houses, office buildings, libraries, theaters, and pubs. These classes would facilitate many activities such as reasoning and communication. For example, just knowing that some building is a house would help to make predictions about its organizat...|$|R
