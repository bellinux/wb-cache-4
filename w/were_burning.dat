5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge <b>were</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses <b>were</b> <b>burning.</b> Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fleet}} {{continued}} south from the Cape in early June, Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish flyboat {{after a long}} chase that brought him near the Spanish coast. The flyboat's master revealed that a great fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a strong force for the West Indies, Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port. Don Alonso de Bazán, brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada, was to pursue and intercept Raleigh's fleet. As Burrough's men <b>were</b> <b>burning</b> the flyboat, part of the Spanish fleet was spotted, and Burrough, having rejoined his own fleet, soon sailed to the Azores.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the politicized {{aspect of}} his {{contribution}} also had negative connotations. According to literary critic Bogdan Crețu (who builds on the conclusions of literary historian Leonte Ivanov), Arbore was also responsible for circulating a stereotyped image of the Russian Empire and its inhabitants. Before 1914, Arbore made accusatory claims about Russification and the Russian Orthodox Church expansion into Bessarabia: depicting the Russian Synod as a heretical, non-Orthodox, institution, he argued that church officials <b>were</b> <b>burning</b> Romanian books for heating.|$|E

As Napoleon entered the Kremlin, there still remained one-third of the original population, mainly consisting of foreign traders, servants and people who were {{unable or unwilling to}} flee.

25|$|A 2010 {{analysis}} of a local stalagmite revealed that Native Americans <b>were</b> <b>burning</b> forests to clear land as early as 100BC. Some regional late-prehistoric Eastern Woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing, practicing the slash-and-burn Eastern Agricultural Complex gardening method, which used fire to clear out underbrush from certain area. Another group progressed to the more time-consuming, advanced companion crop fields method of gardening. Also continuing from ancient indigenous people of the state, they cultivated tobacco through to early historic times. It was used in numerous social and religious rituals.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war ended}} the Jesuits started an {{extensive}} construction programme, building a series of imposing Baroque buildings for the Order and University in order to advertise their newly acquired domination of the Czech lands. This was happening {{against the background of}} savage re-Catholization which, along with war and plague saw the population decline from over 3 million to some 800,000 people. Even the Czech language was considered to be heresy by the Jesuits who <b>were</b> <b>burning</b> books written in Czech: the language was gradually reduced to nothing more than a means of communication between peasants, most of whom were illiterate. The era, generally described as the Dark Age of the Czech Nation, was nevertheless a period of expansion for the Jesuit University of Olomouc: several sciences were now taught at the university, including mathematics and physics (by Jakub Kresa and Jan Tesánek), and cartography (by Valentin Stansel). Hebrew was also studied. Among notable people connected with the university at the time are the mathematician Jan Marek Marci and the historian Bohuslav Balbín.|$|E

Swain sent the regiment's B and C companies, 82 enlisted men and Captain Alexander G. Campbell, First Lieutenant Albert B. Holmes, Second Lieutenant Augustus B. Hazelton, and First Lieutenant George A. Dagwell, under the command of Major Seth Pierre Remington, on the mission. The detachment left the same afternoon and by 10:00p.m., the troops were camped at Fairfax Court House which the Union Army had left the day before.
