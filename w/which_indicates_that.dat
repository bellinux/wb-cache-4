This specimen, and the remains of three or four other individuals, were found in Glacier County, Montana. In this case, the fossils were found in a bonebed of Prosaurolophus remains, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the animals lived together for at least some time.

5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian (around 83.6–72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years ago), that lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event.|$|E

In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in Sélestat, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the town must have had enough appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops.|$|E

5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> {{he was at least}} aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E

According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E

Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E

5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar. Laboratory {{studies show that}} they do so deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. Nectar contains amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when nectar is available. Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey, and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{is part of}} {{the iron}} group of elements, which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.|$|E

5|$|Sirius A is classed as an Am star {{because the}} {{spectrum}} shows deep metallic absorption lines, indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron.

When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by , which is equivalent to 100.5, meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun's atmosphere.

5|$|The {{evolution}} of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800,000 years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's dog, dingo, and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game.

It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine's Germanic subjects is Englisc.

This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, even at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago.
