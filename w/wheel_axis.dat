5000|$|A {{reaction}} wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a momentum wheel, by operating it {{at a constant}} (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with {{a large amount of}} stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the <b>wheel's</b> spin <b>axis)</b> do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion (precession) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this [...] "momentum-bias" [...] stabilization approach include SCISAT-1; by orienting the momentum <b>wheel's</b> <b>axis</b> to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a [...] "pitch momentum bias" [...] configuration.|$|R

50|$|The major {{forces that}} {{accelerate}} a vehicle {{occur at the}} tires' contact patches. Since these forces are not directed through the vehicle's CoM, one or more moments are generated whose forces are the tires' traction forces at pavement level, the other one (equal but opposed) is the mass inertia located at the CoM and the moment arm is the distance from pavement surface to CoM. It is these moments that cause variation in the load distributed between the tires. Often this is interpreted by the casual observer as a pitching or rolling motion of the vehicles body. A perfectly rigid vehicle without suspension that would not exhibit pitching or rolling of the body still undergoes load transfer. However, the pitching and rolling {{of the body of}} a non-rigid vehicle adds some (small) weight transfer due to the (small) CoM horizontal displacement with respect to the <b>wheel's</b> <b>axis</b> suspension vertical travel and also due to deformation of the tires i.e. contact patch displacement relative to wheel.|$|R
