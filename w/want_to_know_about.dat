25|$|Burt defined sex {{education}} as {{the study of}} the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a human being and almost all people, including children, <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that {{sex education}} stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, Tottle {{published}} his controversial book as Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard, {{in which he}} asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are [...] "fraudulent", and [...] "a creation of Nazi propagandists". His book, published by Progress Publishers in Toronto, appeared {{around the same time}} Ukrainian Communist party leader Volodymyr Shcherbytsky publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987. As a result, the book was subsequently withdrawn from circulation. In a review of Tottle's book in the Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, published by the pro-Communist Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, Wilfred Szczesny wrote: [...] "Members of the general public who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the famine, its extent and causes, and about the motives and techniques of those who would make this tragedy into something other than what it was will find Tottle's work invaluable" [...] (The Ukrainian Canadian, April 1988, p.24). Some of Tottle's material appeared in a 1988 article in the Village Voice, [...] "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right".|$|E
2500|$|In English many {{historical}} figures are still referred to {{with the family}} name first. This is especially the case in scholarly works about Japan. Many scholarly works use Japanese order with Japanese names in general, and a scholarly work {{is more likely to}} use Japanese order if the author is a Japanologist. John Power, author of [...] "Japanese names," [...] wrote [...] "People who can speak and read Japanese have a strong resistance to switching Japanese names to the Western order." [...] Books written by these authors often have notes stating that Japanese names are in the original order. Some books do not have consistent naming order practices. Shizuka Saeki of Look Japan said, [...] "This is not only a headache for writers and translators, it is also a source of confusion for readers." [...] Lynne E. Riggs of the Society of Writers, Editors and Translators (SWET), a professional writing organization headquartered in Tokyo, said, [...] "When you publish a book about Japan, you are publishing it for people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Japan.

[...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E
