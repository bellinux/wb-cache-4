5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> {{schizophrenia}} who stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident {{as a person who}} had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Though not a lover in {{the human}} {{physical}} sense, Pons <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overriding passion, the passion for artistic beauty. In its etymological sense passion equates to suffering. Pons <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Christ-like figure, like some other characters in Balzac's novels (e.g., Joseph Bridau in La Rabouilleuse, and Goriot). He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mania or idee fixe, and this passion {{is the cause of}} his suffering and death.|$|R
25|$|Bagri {{would later}} state before his later trial {{that he knew}} was {{probably}} a suspect by October 1985 but insisted he would have faced charges {{if there were any}} evidence he {{had anything to do with}} the bombing. It was established by November that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E
25|$|The {{first white}} man {{to live in}} Plunketts Creek Township <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> the surname of Paulhamus. Tradition states that he was deserter during the Revolutionary War. He fled from the Red coats and cleared {{a small piece of}} land in the {{wilderness}} along Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Bear Creek. Paulhamus was a squatter on the land from 1770 until 1776 when it is thought that he was forced to rejoin the British Army. Permanent settlers did not arrive in Plunketts Creek Township until 1818. Three men Donelly, Smith and Payne found the cabin that had been abandoned by Paulhamus. They expanded Paulhamus' improvements and began farming, fishing and hunting in the area.|$|E
500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a purpose; {{he was very good}} at one thing and made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E

500|$|In Athonite legends, Romanian stories, and Moldavian chronicles alike, Stephen's {{victories}} {{against the}} Ottomans and Hungarians were already regarded as God-inspired, or as {{placed under the}} direct patronage of various saints (George, Demetrius, Procopius, or Mercurius). Worship of Stephen himself was first recorded in the 1570s, but, according to Ureche, he had been regarded as a saint soon after his funeral: [...] "not {{on account of his}} soul ... for he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> sins ... but on account of the great deeds he accomplished". The positive nuances of Ureche's report were also repeated by Miron Costin.|$|E

Winton tells him that his real father <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> whom his mother had an affair during the {{marriage}} {{and that he did}} not have the courage to raise him, not being his real father. With his inner demons resolved, he begins to enjoy life once more and adopts a friendly relationship with director Stevens. Shortly afterward, he dies in a [...] car crash that shocks the film industry and the general public. En route on a train to Indiana, Winton sits next to his coffin in the storage room.|$|E
500|$|Hutton {{stated that}} Murray had treated her source {{material}} with [...] "reckless abandon", {{in that she}} had taken [...] "vivid details of alleged witch practices" [...] from [...] "sources scattered across a great extent of space and time" [...] and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> {{a special kind of}} shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that [...] "Murray's use of sources, in general, is appalling". The pair went on to claim that [...] "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong– she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises".|$|E

[...] Hanslick mentioned in his 1884 review that the pianist played more than 20 pieces in one concert in Vienna, including three sonatas (the Schumann F sharp minor plus Beethoven's D minor and Op. 101 in A). [...] Rubinstein <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> an extremely robust constitution and apparently never tired; audiences apparently stimulated his adrenals {{to the point}} where he acted like a superman. [...] He had a colossal repertoire and an equally colossal memory until he turned 50, when he began to have memory lapses and had to play from the printed note.|$|E
2500|$|John 'Grug' Gregg—South East Antrim (c.1993–2003) John 'Grug' Gregg <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a fearsome {{reputation}} {{within the}} loyalist movement, {{known as a}} [...] "Hawk" [...] in loyalist circles, and controlled the streets of south east Antrim. On 14 March 1984, he severely wounded Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in an assassination attempt {{for which he was}} jailed. When asked by the BBC in prison if he regretted anything about the shooting, his reply was [...] "only that I didn't succeed." [...] He was killed on Belfast's Nelson Street, along with another UDA member (Rab Carson), while travelling in a taxi from the docks in 2003, and the murder was blamed on supporters of Johnny Adair, who had recently been expelled from the UDA in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Bardeen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a very unassuming personality.

He would always ask his guests if they liked the hamburger bun toasted (since he liked his that way). [...] He enjoyed playing golf and going on picnics with his family. [...] Lillian Hoddeson, a University of Illinois historian who wrote a book on Bardeen, said that because he [...] "differed radically from the popular stereotype of 'genius' and was uninterested in appearing other than ordinary, the public and the media often overlooked him." ...|$|E

Their {{introduction of the}} [...] "Speedee Service System" [...] in 1948 furthered {{the principles of the}} modern fast-food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier. The first McDonald's with the arches opened in Phoenix, Arizona in March 1953. The original mascot of McDonald's <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a chef's hat on top of a hamburger-shaped head whose name was [...] "Speedee". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the company symbol. A new mascot, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown-like man having puffed out costume legs appeared in advertising aimed at children.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson {{devoted a}} paper in the Folklore journal {{to the subject of}} [...] "Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why?". She noted that the Murrayite theory was [...] "based on deeply flawed methods and illogical arguments" [...] and that the {{discipline}} of folkloristics had been damaged by its association with Murray, who had been appointed President of the Folklore Society. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 23, just a {{year after}} his first class debut, he was toying {{with the idea of}} giving up his amateur career in England to [...] join his brother in Colorado. [...] His plans changed when he took the record for the highest ever score in cricket at the time with an innings of 485 for Hampstead against Stoics on 4 August 1886. [...] No {{declarations}} were allowed in the game and the Stoics, living up to their name, fielded all day without a chance to bat. [...] Stoddart was seventh out, having batted six hours and ten minutes and clubbed one eight, three fives, and 64 fours. The runs were scored at a rapid pace - the score was 370 for 3 at lunch after 150 minutes of play. He made 207 for Hampstead in the next match three days later and on 9 August was playing for Middlesex and made 98, a grand total of 790 runs in a week. [...] Stoddart <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> a great zest for life in his younger days. [...] He had danced then played cards till dawn before the Stoics game, batted almost through Hampstead's innings of 813, then played tennis, went to the theatre and turned in at 3 a.m. [...] His next innings was against Kent when he posted his maiden first class century in scoring 116.|$|E
