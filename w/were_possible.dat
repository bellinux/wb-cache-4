Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E

40|$|What I {{call the}} {{argument}} from almost indiscernibles is an argument, {{put forward by}} Robert Adams in 1979, {{for the possibility of}} indiscernibles based on the possibility of almost indiscernibles. The argument is that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> but since almost indiscernible <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> The argument seems to be an improvement over the mere appeal to intuitions, like that suggested by Max Black, that situations in which there <b>are</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> for the argument purports to give us a reason that indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> In this paper I shall assess the argument by examining whether there is support for the conditional premise that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> I shall argue that there are reasons to think that either the premise lacks support or almost indiscernibles are dispensable. If the premise lacks support, the argument does not establish the possibility of almost indiscernibles; if almost indiscernibles are dispensable, the argument is not needed to establish the possibility of indiscernibles...|$|R

In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The United States National Weather Service {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Guam as Tropical Storm Saomai approached the island on August 6.

5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the pilot's training course, Göring {{was assigned to}} Jagdstaffel 5. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to Jagdstaffel 26, commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored air victories until May, when {{he was assigned to}} command Jagdstaffel 27. Serving with Jastas 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the Zaehring Lion with swords, the Friedrich Order, the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted Pour le Mérite. According to Hermann Dahlmann, who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award. He finished the war with 22 victories. A thorough post-war examination of Allied loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> and 17 were certain, or highly likely.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the storm}} on August25, the United States Department of Defense set the Condition of Readiness (COR) at stage 3 on Guam, {{indicating}} destructive winds <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> within 48hours. A day later, the COR was raised to stage 2; all but two United States Navy ships were sortied from the harbor to prevent damage, and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam. On August28, COR 1 was declared, the highest level. In response, all fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines. All schools were closed {{for the duration of}} Omar's passage over Guam. Flight operations were suspended for at least two days, stranding 5,000passengers on the island.

5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous designs <b>were</b> <b>possible,</b> {{from simple}} monuments through to {{much more complex}} pieces of sculpture. Obelisks had been a popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were relatively cheap to build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques were another popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
