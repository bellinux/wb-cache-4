2500|$|Krantz thought Patterson {{might have}} perpetrated such a hoax, given the {{opportunity}} and resources. (Roger was an accomplished 2-D artist whose drawings and painting of horses and other wildlife showed a detailed understanding of musculature and anatomy.) But he also argued that Patterson had [...] "nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so—nor for that matter, did anyone else ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{about some of the}} more technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention. Yet he must have known all these details to create a hoax. For instance, he could see the anterior position of the front of the shin, but how that related to foot leverage was quite beyond him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Brothers Karamazov {{has had a}} deep {{influence}} on many writers, philosophers, and public figures over the years. Admirers of the novel include Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Cormac McCarthy, Kurt Vonnegut, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Putin, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton. C. P. Snow, writing about Einstein's admiration of the novel, wrote, [...] "The Brothers Karamazov - that for him in 1919 was the supreme summit of all literature. It remained so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to him in 1937, and probably {{until the end of}} his life." [...] Sigmund Freud called it [...] "the most magnificent novel ever written" [...] and was fascinated with the book for its Oedipal themes. In 1928 Freud published a paper titled [...] "Dostoevsky and Parricide" [...] in which he investigated Dostoyevsky's own neuroses. Freud claimed that Dostoyevsky's epilepsy was not a natural condition but instead a physical manifestation of the author's hidden guilt over his father's death. According to Freud, Dostoyevsky (and all other sons) wished for {{the death of his father}} because of latent desire for his mother; and as evidence Freud cites the fact that Dostoyevsky's epileptic fits did not begin until he turned 18, the year his father died. The themes of patricide and guilt, especially in the form of moral guilt illustrated by Ivan Karamazov, would then obviously follow for Freud as literary evidence of this theory.|$|E
