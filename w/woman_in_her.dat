5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate {{the extent to which}} people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both {{trying to make a living}} from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a still image of a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bikini (Manuela Arbeláez) while various scenery backdrops are {{superimposed}} in the background. The first scenes of the video flicker between Diddy’s life with his femme fatale and Diddy singing {{with the rest of}} Dirty Money in the bedroom of a mansion. Some of the possessions in the house such as picture frames shatter as the chorus builds up. However, during Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper’s verses, the camera focus on Richard and Harper singing directly into the camera lens. As Drake’s verse begins, Diddy falls backwards into a swimming pool in slow motion, while the camera image slowly fades into a club scene. There is a brief shot of a bottle of coconut-flavored Cîroc vodka before Diddy is scene mingling in the club. The camera mainly focus on Drake, who is observing what is happening and rapping his verse. During the bridge, Richard and Harper appear in the club and Diddy’s femme fatale is seen in the background.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E
