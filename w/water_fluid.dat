50|$|Angiotensin II is an octapeptide hormone {{central to}} the renin-angiotensin system.It regulates blood {{pressure}} control, <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> homeostasis, and neuronal excitability. Receptor agonists and antagonist of angiotensin II receptors that target {{various parts of the}} complicated renin-angiotensin system were developed to increase knowledge of the renin-angiotensin system and aid the development of antihypertensive drug candidates. These investigations led to the discovery of two subtypes of membrane bound G protein-coupled angiotensin receptors within the renin-angiotensin system with vastly different functions: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). ATR is the receptor subtype that was found to be mainly responsible for blood pressure, <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> regulation, and other classical known physiological actions of angiotensin II on the renin-angiotensin system. Drugs that antagonize ATR have become used as common treatments for hypertension and congestive heart failure. Functions of ATR were unknown in comparison.|$|E

50|$|Nociceptive pain is {{immediate}} pain felt as {{a result}} of injury inflicted upon tissue. Neuropathic pain, in contrast, is long-lasting pain that develops when the peripheral and the central nervous system are sensitized following injury to these systems. Neuropathic pain may be continuous pain, spontaneous, or pain caused by hypersensitivity to non-nociceptive levels of stimulus.Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide that regulates blood pressure, controls <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> balance, and pain perception. It activates two membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). AgnII co-localization with substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide implies its role in nociception. ATR, the receptor mainly responsible for AngII's effect on the pain mechanisms within the nervous system, is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as well as human trigeminal ganglia. These receptors are locally produced inside DRG neurons, implying the presence of an intrinsic angiotensinergic system. Injured nerves and painful neuromas show higher ATR expression compared to normal undamaged nerves. AngII contributes to neuropathic pain by potentiating neuronal pathways that signal pain when AngII activates ATR expressed on pain detecting neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by increasing neurite length and density in DRG neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by sensitizing nociceptors as well. Nociceptor sensitization suggests a decreased thresholds for activation of nociceptors. ATR activation increases kinase levels in DRG neurons, such as levels of PKA, PKC and MAPK, via G protein-coupled receptor-activated second messenger pathways. These phosphorylating enzymes sensitize major voltage-gated ion channels found on DRG neurons. Sensitization increases neuronal excitation following receptor channel activation. EMA401 antagonized human ATR with a Ki of 5.4 nM, IC of 39 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.3. EMA401 alleviates pain and provides relief by blocking the AngII induced potentiation.|$|E

40|$|The opioid {{antagonist}} naltrexone reduces responding for ethanol. If naltrexone produces this effect by blocking ethanol-induced opioid activity, then naltrexone should reduce responding for ethanol regardless of {{level of the}} ethanol responding relative to an alternatively available reinforcer. In addition, if naltrexone competitively blocks ethanol-induced opioid activity, then the naltrexone effect may be surmountable by increasing ethanol concentration and, thus, ethanol intake (g/kg). This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether naltrexone will selectively reduce ethanol-reinforced responding when the ethanol concentration is varied such that ethanol fluid deliveries are less than, greater than, or equal to the fluid deliveries of concurrently available water. Methods : Four adult male rhesus monkeys were allowed to respond for ethanol or water concurrently for 2 hr per day. Ethanol concentration was either 2 %, 8 %, or 32 %. On various days, either saline or naltrexone (0. 1 mg/kg) was given intramuscularly 30 min before the drinking session. Results : When ethanol fluid deliveries were greater than those of water (at 2 % ethanol), naltrexone reduced responding for ethanol. When the ethanol and <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> deliveries were approximately equal (at 8 % ethanol), naltrexone reduced both ethanol and <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> deliveries. When <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> deliveries were greater than those of ethanol (at 32 % ethanol), naltrexone reduced responding for water. Conclusions : Thus, naltrexone reduced responding for the preferred fluid, either ethanol or water, depending on ethanol concentration. The effect was not surmountable by increasing ethanol concentration and, therefore, ethanol intake (g/kg). Naltrexone may reduce ethanol-reinforced responding by a mechanism other than that of blocking ethanol-induced opioid activity. Naltrexone may be inducing an aversive interoceptive state...|$|E

The preference for the drug over a nondrug alternative has indicated that the drug has greater value than the nondrug alternative as a reinforcer at some drug concentrations. However, at large drug concentrations, the fluid deliveries of the drug may be equal to or less {{than those of the}} nondrug alternative, whereas the actual drug intake (milligrams per kilogram of body weight) may continue to increase. In this study, we used behavioral economics to evaluate the reinforcing strength of ethanol in conditions where baseline ethanol fluid deliveries were greater than, equal to, or less than those of the concurrently available water. Methods : Four male rhesus monkeys were allowed access to ethanol (2 %, 8 %, or 32 %) and water for 2 hr/day under a fixed ratio (FR) 4 reinforcement schedule. At each ethanol concentration, the FR for both fluids was gradually increased to FR 64. Results : During the FR 4 schedule, the fluid deliveries of ethanol at 2 %, 8 %, and 32 % were greater than, equal to, and less than those of water, respectively. When the FR was increased at 2 % ethanol, fluid deliveries and responding decreased for both the ethanol and water. When the FR was increased at 8 % ethanol, <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> deliveries and responding decreased more rapidly than did those of ethanol. When the FR was increased at 32 % ethanol, the ethanol fluid deliveries remained the same across all FRs, whereas <b>water</b> <b>fluid</b> deliveries decreased rapidly.

Conclusions : In behavioral economic terms, demand for ethanol was more inelastic regardless of whether the ethanol or water maintained more absolute fluid deliveries at baseline FRs. Therefore, researchers should examine the reinforcing effects of ethanol in a variety of concentration and schedule conditions rather than drawing inferences regarding reinforcing effects simply based on a preference measure...|$|E
