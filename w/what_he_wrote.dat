5|$|Edward VI became {{seriously ill}} from {{tuberculosis}} and the councillors {{were told that}} he did not have long to live. In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving. Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the Regius Chair in Cambridge which was vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses. Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer. Despite his plea, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England. While this effort to shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to convince several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward's cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's daughter and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act. Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors. Edward told him that he supported <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in his will. Cranmer's decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession.|$|E

These lines are followed by the lines published in the Morning Post, which make up lines 121–271a. The poem is concluded with a series of fragments from Joan of Ark Book II that make up the rest of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> for the epic.|$|E

25|$|On 30 October 2012, Polish {{magazine}} Rzeczpospolita {{reported that}} traces of explosives had been detected by investigators {{in the wreckage}} of the Tupolev, on the wings and in the cabin. The claims were denied by Polish prosecutors – who pointed out that a number of common substances could as well have produced the observed readings – and were later withdrawn by the magazine itself. Rzeczpospolita's editor-in-chief and three other staff, including the reporter of the initial claim, resigned from their jobs. The author of the article in question, Cezary Gmyz, maintained that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> was confirmed by four independent sources. In November 2015, a court in Poland ruled in favour of the sacked journalists, stating that the information published in the article correctly reflected the state of knowledge at the time of publication.|$|E
25|$|Fitzgerald wrote several {{chapters}} {{for this}} version of the novel in 1925 and 1926, but was unable to finish it. Nearly all of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> ultimately made it into the finished work in altered form. Francis's arrival on the Riviera with his mother, and his introduction {{to the world of the}} Pipers, was eventually transposed into Rosemary Hoyt's arrival with her mother, and her introduction to the world of Dick and Nicole Diver. Characters created in this early version survived into the final novel, particularly Abe and Mary North (originally Grant) and the McKiscos. Several incidents such as Rosemary's arrival and early scenes on the beach, her visit to the Riviera movie studio, and the dinner party at the Divers' villa all appeared in this original version, but with Francis in the role of the wide-eyed outsider that would later be filled by Rosemary. Also, the sequence in which a drunken Dick is beaten by police in Rome was written in this first version as well (with Francis as the beaten victim); this was based on a real incident that happened to Fitzgerald in Rome in 1924.|$|E

"The {{complicated}} {{legacy of}} Cornelius “Dusty” Rhoads, {{who died in}} 1959, should not cause society to promote nor deny his existence but should provide a perspective that neither condones <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> or thought—or the whitewashing of the incident by institutions and media of the 1930s—but that does give him due appropriate credit for his accomplishments as well as acknowledgement of his faults and sins." ...|$|E

500|$|Helped by his {{defensive}} successes, he thus gained Hitler's full {{trust and}} confidence; the Führer called him [...] "my best field marshal" [...] and (after Operation Bagration) [...] "the saviour of the Eastern Front". In turn, this granted Model {{a degree of}} flexibility available to no other German general. He frequently disputed, ignored or bypassed orders that he felt unsupportable: at Rzhev and Orel he had constructed defensive fortifications in defiance of a ban, and his use of Shield and Sword tactics while at Army Group North proved to be simply a cover for a staged withdrawal. His relationships with his superiors were marked by dissembling, where <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in his reports could bear little resemblance to what was actually happening.|$|E
500|$|Several {{of those}} {{affected}} {{by the events of}} the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what became New Hampshire. [...] A larger group of men were uncertain where to go, so they contacted Roger Williams who suggested that they purchase land from the Narragansett people along the Narragansett Bay, near his settlement of Providence Plantations. [...] John Clarke apparently did both, based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in his book: [...] "By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer before , I went to the North to be somewhat cooler, but the winter following [...] proved so cold, that we were forced in the spring to make towards the South." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at the school, Ripley became disenchanted {{with his father and}} his home town, admitting [...] "no {{particular}} attachment to Greenfield". He hoped to enroll at Andover but his father convinced him to stay in Cambridge to attend Harvard Divinity School. There, he was influenced by Levi Frisbie, Professor of Natural Religion, who was largely interested in moral philosophy, which he termed [...] "the science of the principles and obligations of duty". Ripley was becoming very interested in more [...] "liberal" [...] religious views, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> to his mother as [...] "so simple, scriptural, and reasonable". He graduated in 1826. A year later, on August 22, 1827, he married Sophia Dana, a fact which he originally kept a secret from his parents. He asked his sister Marianne to inform them shortly after.|$|E

500|$|... "Dial Meg for Murder" [...] is the 11th {{episode of}} season {{eight of the}} {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 31, 2010. The episode follows teenager Meg as she dates and {{falls in love with}} an inmate at the local prison. She eventually ends up hiding the fugitive in the Griffin family home, however, and is convicted and sent to jail. After returning home, she becomes a hardened criminal, who continually tortures her family. While starting a life away from home, Meg sees the magazine article that the family dog Brian wrote about her. Touched by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote,</b> Meg returns home and thanks Brian in return. Prior to her storyline, Meg's father Peter attempts to win a local championship rodeo competition, but his attempts to sabotage the competition to ensure his win gets the best of him after getting assaulted by the bull he rode on.|$|E
500|$|By late 1917 it {{was clear}} to Walpole and to the British {{authorities}} that there was little advantage in keeping him in Russia. On 7 November he left, missing the Bolshevik Revolution, which began on that day. He was appointed to a post at the Foreign Office in its Department of Information, headed by John Buchan. Soon after returning he volunteered for the British army, but, as expected, failed the necessary medical examination because of his poor sight. He continued to work in British propaganda when the department was reconstituted under Lord Beaverbrook in April 1918, and remained there {{for the rest of the}} war and beyond, resigning in February 1919. Little is known about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> for the department, as most of its records were destroyed after the war, but he noted in his diary that he had written the department's official report to the War Cabinet: [...] "a beastly job – the worst I've ever attempted". For his wartime work he was awarded the CBE in 1918.|$|E
500|$|So Beautiful or So What finds Simon {{returning}} to more harmonic-based compositions than rhythm-based. This was spurred {{from when he}} realized his favorite song on his 2006 effort Surprise, [...] "Everything About It Is a Love Song", contained a chord progression he found particularly interesting. After coming to this realization, he focused on the album’s three ballads, [...] "Questions for the Angels", [...] "Amulet", and [...] "Love and Hard Times". Unlike his previous rhythm-based albums, {{in which he would}} gain inspiration for his guitar parts from pre-recorded backing tracks, Simon took a more traditional approach to building the songs on So Beautiful or So <b>What.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> songs at home before developing them further in the studio {{with the help of a}} natural click track, such as [...] "a percussion instrument, or even just tapping out a rhythm on his guitar." [...] He overdubbed additional elements afterwards, including additional guitar parts and percussion. Simon began envisioning the album’s sequencing when he only had a few songs written, letting it inform his songwriting.|$|E

500|$|While his {{explanation}} {{was found to}} be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two orioles he had seen building a nest outside his window. Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair [...] "plainly deliberated" [...] their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then [...] "tied a single knot at the extreme end" [...] of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time. Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. The Atlantic Monthly did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by Century Magazine. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, [...] "After such an example as this, how long will it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mail sent Beach Thomas to France {{as a war}} {{correspondent}} {{during the}} First World War. Many newspapers were keen to support the war effort and {{to take advantage of}} the demand for news from the front. The British military authorities were opposed to the presence of journalists, preferring instead to control the media by issuing official press releases. Lord Kitchener in particular was opposed to their presence, having had bad experiences of journalists during the Boer War. He formed a press bureau headed by , and demanded that all reports be channelled through the bureau for review by censors; the resulting output was bland and impersonal. The newspapers countered with subterfuge. Beach Thomas was one of several journalists who managed to reach the front lines in Belgium. He was discovered there and imprisoned for some time by the British Army. He described the episode as [...] "the longest walking tour of my life, and the queerest." [...] Even these early unapproved reports, which consisted mostly of human interest stories because there was little opportunity for contact with the British Expeditionary Force, were censored at home owing to a paradox that Beach Thomas described: [...] "the censors would not publish any article if it indicated that the writer had seen <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> of. He must write what he thought was true, not what he knew to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|Liu {{was once}} an eminent scholar, but was {{reportedly}} little-known inside the People's Republic of China (PRC) {{at the time of}} the award due to official censorship. Those who had heard about Liu had mixed views about him. Some clearly supported the government position, whereas one university student was quoted as saying [...] "George Orwell probably had no idea that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> would end up being the reality of China now." [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] and [...] "Nobel Peace Prize" [...] became the most searched terms among internet users in China. However, some time after the release of the official response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, government censors screened the news item, and there were reports of searches in China using Chinese search engines returning error pages. Web searches using Chinese search engines for [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] in Chinese without attaching the words [...] "Peace Prize," [...] gave information about Liu. Yet most sites found [...] "Liu" [...] plus [...] "Peace Prize" [...] yield only the official foreign ministry response. CNN reported that any mention of [...] "Nobel Prize" [...] on microblogging sites was censored. One person claimed that his SIM card was deactivated after he sent a text message to a relative about the Nobel Peace Prize. Accustomed to circumventing Chinese internet censorship, bloggers and forum-users used variants of Liu's name and posted subtle or cryptic messages to express their elation about the award or sarcasm towards the state. The statement on 8 October by renowned blogger Han Han consisted of only a pair of double quote marks.|$|E

500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote.</b> Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of time devoted to research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E
