5000|$|Upon its introduction, DECtape was {{considered}} a major improvement over hand-loaded paper tapes, {{which could not be}} used to support swap files essential for practical timesharing. Early hard disk and drum drives were very expensive, limited in capacity, and notoriously unreliable, so the DECtape was a breakthrough in supporting the first timesharing systems on DEC computers. The legendary PDP-1 at MIT, where early computer hacker culture developed, adopted multiple DECtape drives to support a primitive software sharing community. The hard disk system (when it was working) {{was considered}} a [...] "temporary" [...] file storage device used for speed, not to be trusted to hold files for long-term storage. Computer users would keep their own personal <b>work</b> <b>files</b> on DECtapes, as well as software to be shared with others.|$|E
