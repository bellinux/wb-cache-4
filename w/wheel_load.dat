25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (<b>wheel)</b> <b>load,</b> wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E

50|$|Increase in <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> As <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to handle prolonged rail traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to handle prolonged rail traffic also decreases as <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> increase.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between heavy vehicle and road surface roughness results in vibrations that {{detract from the}} perceived comfort of the driver, and generate dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> which are believed to increase pavement wear. This paper describes the methodology for assessing the viability of a new profile-based index (PI^sub t^), developed in previous work, {{as a predictor of}} the magnitude of dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads,</b> and discusses the results. In the previous work, roughness content in the waveband 4. 8 - 19. 5 m correlated best with the mean ratings of ride quality by a panel of truck drivers. When travelling at normal highway speeds, roughness wavelengths in this band excite the low frequency vibration modes of the heavy vehicle body. As these modes are considered to be the major contributors to dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> of road pavements, it was hypothesised that the PIt could alsobe a good predictor of the magnitude of the dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> Computer simulations of the dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> were carried out by using a full vehicle model and the profiles of 10 pavement sections as the excitation inputs. Tests of the PI^sub t^ proved that it is a good predictor of the dynamic loading of some road pavements. However, careful examination of the data resulted in identifying another profile index, the overall root mean square of profile elevation, that provides good predictions of the magnitude of dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> for all pavement sections considered in this study. The variable sub-grade and climate conditions between the test sections influence the extent of long wavelength roughness development and, ultimately, the excitation levels of the low frequency vibration modes of the truck body. One-third octave band analysis was used to study the effects of these factors on the dynamic behaviour of road pavements...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{rotating}} force alternately reduces the <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> {{as well as}} augmenting it every revolution the sustainable tractive effort at the contact patch drops off once per wheel revolution and the wheels may slip.

40|$|AbstractGrinding is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} which can produce very fine surface finishes. The removed chips from the workpiece which get welded to the porosities between the abrasive grains can adversely affect the final {{surface finish of}} the machined component. Quantitative analysis of <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> can provide information about the cutting conditions of the wheel. With the development {{in the field of}} machine vision and image processing, this study focuses on developing a system for the quantitative assessment of <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> using image capturing and image processing. Images of the grinding wheel were acquired using microscope with a magnification of 20 x.

50|$|It {{works by}} {{applying}} braking pressure asymmetrically despite physically difficult conditions (e.g. the car swerving towards {{the inside of}} the bend when the <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> changes). By asymmetrically distributing brake pressure to the left- and right-side brakes or by reducing pressure (to the rear axle), even if the driver brakes outside the normal range of ABS.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of load impact systems; single-mass (e.g. Dynatest, Carl Bro, PaveTesting) and double-mass (KUAB). In a single-mass system, a weight is dropped onto a single buffer connected to a load plate, which rests on the surface being tested. The load force is transferred through the plate, and the plate creates a deflection that simulates a <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> In the double-mass system, the weight drops onto a double-buffer system, which includes a first buffer, a second weight, and a second buffer. The double-mass system essentially produces a longer loading duration that more precisely representsa <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> The double-mass system has higher reproducibility and gives a more accurate result on pavements built on soft soils. The single-mass system will seriously overestimate the capacity of pavements built on soft soils. However, single-mass FWDs are smaller, cheaper and faster. Low-cost FWD:s for the Indian market are currently (2015) being developed independently by Geotran, PaveTesting and KUAB.|$|E

40|$|Wheel surface {{condition}} {{plays an important}} role in the grinding operation. Grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>loading,</b> meaning chip accumulation in the space between grains, leads to deteriorating wheel cutting ability and causes excessive force and temperature. This paper presents an analytical model of <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> phenomena as a function of cutting parameters, wheel structure, and material properties. The model is based on the adhesion of workpiece material to abrasive grain surface. It is validated by experimental results from grinding nickel-based superalloy with cubic boron nitride vitrified wheel. This model considers wheel specifications including abrasive grains size and the number of cutting edges. Cutting parameters and process temperature are the other determinant factors. On the basis of this model and empirical results, the effects of the various process parameters are presented...|$|R
