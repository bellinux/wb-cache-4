5|$|The Lothian 'Ridacard' bus pass is a {{pre-paid}} plastic smartcard giving unlimited {{travel on}} regular daytime and night bus services, {{as well as}} Edinburgh Trams services. It is purchased initially from a Transport for Edinburgh Travelshop, where the owner's picture is incorporated on the card to prevent misuse. Once purchased, the card can be placed onto an on-board reader, <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> the contactless chip in the smartcard. Cards can be credited for a weekly, 4 weekly or annual period. A warning is displayed on the last five days of validity. The card can then be topped up at Transport for Edinburgh Travelshops or Pay Point equipped retailers.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E

25|$|All {{examination}} scripts {{are shipped}} to the Ministry of Education for processing, which then sends them to other teachers in Singapore on a random basis for marking. Part of this procedure is to prevent possible bias in marking, either intentional or unintentional, that may result when teachers mark examination scripts of students from their own schools. Also, {{the names of the}} students are not attached to the scripts when the scripts are sent for marking, the scripts are labelled by the student's PSLE index number. The multiple choice questions are graded by a machine in the Ministry of Education, <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> the optical answer sheets.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E

25|$|Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") {{refers to}} {{definition}} from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead {{which is not}} found in Hillel, and <b>which</b> <b>reads</b> thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by {{the help of a}} third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.|$|E
