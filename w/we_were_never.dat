5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

25|$|The {{most recent}} {{war in the}} Balkans began in 1991 when the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia {{declared}} their independence from Yugoslavia {{following the death of}} Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The Republic of Bosnia & Herzegovina followed suit and within a year it was announced the hospitals in several cities were no longer functional, and thousands of refugees had fled to the mountains. As the refugees were ill-equipped to face the coming winter, most were expected to perish. VFP's UN-NGO representative Ben Weintraub was instructed to offer U.N. officials whatever assistance VFP could provide in helping to deliver medical and humanitarian aid. Though the situation in Bosnia worsened, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> called upon. Following discussions with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), another UN-NGO, the VFP National Office began contacting hospitals around the U.S. requesting pro-bono services for any war wounded children that could be evacuated. Within weeks VFP had secured pro-bono space and services for over 100 wounded children, but I.O.M. had been able to evacuate very few due, unfortunately, to Serbian, Croatian, and U.N. political constraints. In response, VFP organized the Children of War Rescue Project and with assistance from contacts in the U.K., chief among them, Dr. John Morrison of the Ex-Services Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and over 200 other British volunteers, a 63 vehicle convoy including 50 ambulances was staged at Brighton, England. Seven VFP volunteers including three physicians also joined the convoy that traveled almost non-stop for five days and nights. The convoy stopped only to regroup in Croatia. A Spanish battalion of U.N. protection forces assisted with armored vehicles in the evacuation of over 22 wounded children from East Mostar, Bosnia, including at least one family member accompanying each child. The children were airlifted to Ancona, Italy, and once stabilized, from there to hospitals throughout western Europe and the United States. In all, pro bono space and medical services were provided for about 50 wounded Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian children through VFP's Children of War Rescue Project.|$|E

500|$|After {{voting to}} eject the two teams, {{officials}} banned the Soviet {{team from the}} tournament banquet and medal ceremony, but they still invited Canada. McDonald stated the Canadians were not interested, which Sabetzki and Czechoslovak officials responded to by ordering the Canadian team out of the arena within half an hour. [...] They were met by armed soldiers who escorted them across the border and out of Czechoslovakia. [...] The IIHF voided the standing of both teams, including individual statistics. In the words of McDonald, [...] "it was like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> here." [...] However, the other teams kept the points they gained in the matches against both teams.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{responded by}} saying: [...] "Everybody has {{the freedom to}} make a judgement.

[...] He insisted the draws did not reflect on his team's {{negative}} tactics, but [...] "because of other teams coming back into the game". On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a chance. They all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E

At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself, where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House, {{although}} Baird and her friends called it [...] "frothy coffee". At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as she would never have allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy then. It was a way of life. Everything was becoming more free. We'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties. People always gave us a place to stay – <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> harmed." ...|$|E

500|$|An inquest into Shaw's death {{commenced}} in Exeter {{shortly after}} her death was reported to the coroner. The inquest heard evidence in late 2009, among which was eyewitness testimony that the team manager, a teacher from Edgehill College, had met with the group the morning of Shaw's death. During the meeting, the group asked to end the training hike early, but they were instructed by the teacher to carry on. However, the group's navigator gave evidence that she and Shaw had been happy to continue the expedition. The possibility was also raised by other group members that the group was under-prepared for the conditions they faced. The group member whose bag Shaw had been attempting to throw across the stream told the coroner [...] "We were not told how to cross swollen rivers. We were told how to check how deep it was but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> told how to cross them. Nobody ever talked to us about using ropes".|$|E
500|$|Al Jean {{was born}} Alfred Ernest Jean III on January 9, 1961.

Jean arrived at Harvard University when he was sixteen years old and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Daryl Libow, one of Jean's freshman roommates, said he was a [...] "math whiz" [...] when he arrived at Harvard but [...] "soon blossomed and found his comedic feet." [...] In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Jean met fellow freshman Mike Reiss; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said [...] "they definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> surprised that they went on to success." [...] Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that [...] "it was practically my second dorm room." [...] He eventually became vice-president of the publication.|$|E

500|$|Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng {{wanted the}} film to look [...] "grittier and less clean and glossy" [...] than other superhero films, and decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in {{post-production}} to keep texture in the images. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, opposed to Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. Exterior scenes in the film have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with [...] "unpredictable" [...] weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks, and [...] "just had to keep shooting, rain or shine, because once our permit expired on the bridge, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> {{going to get it}} back." [...] Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep the look consistent. Production designer Sean Haworth also worked closely with Miller, who had specific ideas for the sets. The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were built physically to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI, and a gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with a lot of digital elements. That final sequence was filmed in a naval yard, and was dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.|$|E

2500|$|Macmillan was one {{of several}} people who advised Thatcher to set up a small War Cabinet to manage the Falklands War. On his advice she {{excluded}} the Treasury from this body. Having first inquired whether Argentina was known to have atomic weapons, Macmillan's advice was to appoint a senior military advisor, as Pug Ismay had been in the Second World War (in the event Admiral Lewin (Chief of Defence Staff) performed this role). She had already received advice to exclude the Treasury from Frank Cooper (Permanent Under-Secretary for Defence), not least because of Macmillan's own behaviour, as Chancellor, in demanding a halt to the Suez operation. She later wrote: 'I never regretted following Harold Macmillan's advice. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> tempted to compromise the security of our forces for financial reasons.

2500|$|Though {{the show}} {{occasionally}} featured guest actors (notably Neve Campbell and Nicole de Boer well {{before they became}} famous), the Kids played nearly all parts, both male and female, themselves.

Female impersonation had begun during their stage show, because they found themselves writing female characters but had no female member to play them. As Scott Thompson explained, [...] "The way we played women ... we weren't winking at the audience ... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>never,</b> like, going, 'Oh, look at me! I'm a guy in a dress!' Never.
