5|$|Relations between Grand Lodges are {{determined}} by the concept of Recognition. Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons <b>why</b> <b>one</b> Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are Exclusive Jurisdiction and Regularity.|$|E

50|$|Water's sizable {{enthalpy}} of vaporization is <b>why</b> <b>one's</b> skin can {{be burned}} so quickly as steam condenses on it (heading from red to green in Fig. 7 above). In the opposite direction, this is <b>why</b> <b>one's</b> skin feels cool as liquid water on it evaporates (a process that occurs at a sub-ambient wet-bulb temperature that is dependent on relative humidity). Water's highly energetic {{enthalpy of vaporization}} {{is also an important}} factor underlying why solar pool covers (floating, insulated blankets that cover swimming pools when not in use) are so effective at reducing heating costs: they prevent evaporation. For instance, the evaporation of just 20 mm of water from a 1.29-meter-deep pool chills its water 8.4 degrees Celsius (15.1 °F).|$|R

25|$|The {{respiratory}} centers {{try to maintain}} an arterial CO2 pressure of 40mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is <b>why</b> <b>one</b> can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.|$|E

25|$|Mohism was {{developed}} by Mozi (468–376 BC) and it provided a unified moral and political philosophy based on impartiality and benevolence.

Mozi was very much against warfare, although {{he was a great}} tactician in defense. He defended the small state of Song from many attempts of the Chu state.|$|E
25|$|Detecting an aroma is {{only part}} of wine tasting. The next step is to {{describe}} or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of wine tasting appears. Different individuals have their own way of describing familiar scents and aromas based on their unique experiences.

25|$|Another {{sighting}} {{took place}} in 1905 {{off the coast of}} Brazil. The crew of the Valhalla and two naturalists, Michael J. Nicoll and E. G. B.

Based on its dorsal fin and the shape of its head, some (such as Bernard Heuvelmans) have suggested that the animal was some sort of marine mammal. A skeptical suggestion is that the sighting was of a giant squid swimming with one arm and fin visible, but this is problematical, as there are no reports of squid swimming in such a manner, and no apparent reason <b>why</b> <b>one</b> would.|$|E

25|$|Carnot {{published}} his {{book in the}} heyday of steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were better because of the higher temperature of the consequent hot reservoir. Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain <b>why</b> <b>one</b> existing practice was superior to others. It was only {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its hot reservoir is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder <b>why.</b> <b>One</b> night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more than she could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
25|$|This left John Parkin, {{the local}} {{architect}} {{who would have}} worked with the American Bunshaft, to design Toronto-Dominion Centre. His firm put forward a model showing a 100-storey, all-concrete tower—to be {{the largest in the}} Commonwealth—standing over a plaza with a sunken courtyard containing a circular banking pavilion. It was at this point that Phyllis Lambert insisted that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (whom she knew from having been the director of planning on his Seagram Building) be called for an interview. Mies was unimpressed by Parkin's concept and wondered <b>why</b> <b>one</b> would design a building to be entered through its basement. With this, the Parkin proposal was scrapped and Allen Lambert was convinced to bring Mies on board. Though he was technically commissioned as the design consultant to the local architects (who were still John B. Parkin and Associates, but partnered with Bregman + Hamann Architects), the project was essentially Mies' design in its entirety, demonstrating all the key characteristics of the architect's unique style.|$|E

25|$|Probably no one {{living in}} the eighth century would have {{predicted}} that the great Mercian empire would be destroyed and that the West Saxons with their poor track record for feuds and infighting within the royal house would emerge as the dominant kingdom in the ninth century. The nobility {{under the influence of}} Alfred became involved with developing the cultural life of their kingdom. As the kingdom became one they brought the monastic and spiritual life of the kingdom under one rule and stricter control. However the Anglo-Saxons believed in 'luck' as a random element in the affairs of man and so would probably have agreed that {{there is a limit to}} the extent one can understand <b>why</b> <b>one</b> kingdom failed while another succeeded. They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons. Danish and Norman conquests were just the manner in which God punished his sinful people and the fate of great empires.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{archaeology}} in formerly Punic areas {{has discovered}} {{a number of}} large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice called the Tophet by archaeologists. These cemeteries {{may have been used}} as graves for stillborn infants or children who died very early. Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted by many archeologists as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice. An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC in the tophet discovered in the Salammbô neighbourhood of present-day Carthage with the practice continuing until {{the early years of the}} Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and two-year-olds. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not known <b>why.</b> <b>One</b> explanation for this correlation is the claim that the Carthaginians prayed for divine intervention via child sacrifice; however, bad times would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{a flaw in}} the {{marriage}} ceremony {{is considered to be}} a last resort in releasing an agunah. It is rarely used as it is typically difficult in finding actual cause in most marriages to retroactively invalidate it. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the agunah, efforts are made to identify reasons <b>why</b> <b>one</b> of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and {{the marriage}} ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that the woman did not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the halakhic authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize a marriage that was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a halakhic ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.|$|E
