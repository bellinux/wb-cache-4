25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it is not for the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E

25|$|Until 1958, no one {{had been}} able to {{successfully}} establish a revolving credit financial system in which a card issued by a third-party bank was being generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. There had been a dozen attempts by small American banks, but none of them were able to last very long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California, which would become the first successful recognizably modern credit card. This card succeeded where others failed by breaking the chicken-and-egg cycle in which consumers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> card that few merchants would accept and merchants did not want to accept a card that few consumers used. Bank of America chose Fresno because 45% of its residents used the bank, and by sending a card to 60,000 Fresno residents at once, the bank was able to convince merchants to accept the card. It was eventually licensed to other banks around the United States and then around the world, and in 1976, all BankAmericard licensees united themselves under the common brand Visa. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card, launched in 1967, into Master Charge in 1969.|$|E
500|$|As {{a student}} of Hans Hofmann she was taught to {{practice}} her art with a limited palette, using colors such as black and white, to [...] "discipline" [...] herself. These colors would become part of Nevelson's repertoire. She spray painted her walls black until 1959. Nevelson described black as the [...] "total color" [...] that [...] "means totality. It means: contains all... it contained all color. It wasn't a negation of color. It was an acceptance. Because black encompasses all colors. Black is the most aristocratic color of all. The only aristocratic color... I have seen things that were transformed into black, that took on greatness. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> lesser word." [...] In the 1960s she began incorporating white and gold into her works. Nevelson said that white was the color that [...] "summoned the early morning and emotional promise." [...] She described her gold phase as the [...] "baroque phase", inspired by the idea being told as a child that America's streets would be [...] "paved with gold", the materialism and hedonism of the color, the sun, and the moon. Nevelson revisited the Noh robes and the gold coin collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration.|$|E
