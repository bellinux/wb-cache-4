40|$|The {{knowledge}} of a species' population structure {{is essential for the}} development of adequate conservation actions {{as well as for the}} understanding of its evolution. The population structure is unknown in all species of the Genus Psammodromus, including the Western Sand Racer (Psammodromus occidentalis; a recently described species), the Edward's Sand Racer (P. edwardsianus) and the Spanish Sand Racer (P. hispanicus). In this article, the genetic variability and population structure of Psammodromus edwardsianus, P. hispanicus, and P. occidentalis were studied in the Iberian Peninsula covering their natural geographic distribution. Mitochondrial DNA showed genetically different units in all species with higher genetic variability in their southern populations (latitudinal variation).

30|$|This paper proposes an {{analysis}} of political homophily among Twitter users during the 2016 American Presidential Election. We collected 4.9 million tweets of 18, 450 users and their contact network from August 2016 to November 2016. We defined six user classes regarding their sentiment towards Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: whatever, Trump supporter, Hillary supporter, positive, neutral, and negative. Next, we analyzed their political homophily in three scenarios. Firstly, we analyzed the Twitter follow, mention and retweet connections either unidirectional and reciprocal. In the second scenario, we analyzed multiplex connections, and in the third one, we analyzed friendships <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> speeches. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> showed that negative users, users supporting Trump, and users supporting Hillary had homophily in all analyzed scenarios. We also {{found out that the}} homophily level increase when there are reciprocal connections, similar speeches, or multiplex connections.|$|R

We used event-related potentials {{to investigate the}} time course of identifying the emotional meaning of nouns and names. The emotional valence of names and nouns were manipulated separately. The results show early N 1 effects in response to emotional valence only for nouns. This might reflect automatic attention directed towards emotional stimuli. The absence of such an effect for names supports the notion that the emotional meaning carried by names is accessed after word recognition and person identification. In addition, both names with negative valence and emotional nouns elicited late positive effects, which have been associated with evaluation of emotional significance. This positive effect started earlier for nouns than for names, but <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> durations. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> suggest that distinct neural systems are involved in the retrieval of names' and nouns' emotional meaning.

A full database of 144 vehicles (cars) was used to identify statistically relevant features. In order to compare the vehicle transit noise in different environmental condition, all 1 / 3 -octave band spectra were normalized and analysed. Unsupervised clustering algorithms were employed to group together spectrum levels <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> profiles. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> corroborate {{the well-known}} fact that speed is the most relevant characteristic to discriminate between different vehicle noise spectrum. In keeping with this fact, we present a new approach to predict analytically noise spectra for a given vehicle speed. A set of speed-dependent analytical functions are suggested in order to fit the normalized average spectrum profile at different speeds. This approach can be useful for predicting vehicle speed based purely on its noise spectrum pattern.

40|$|The TonB system energizes {{transport}} of nutrients across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli using cytoplasmic membrane {{proton motive force}} (PMF) for energy. Integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD appear to harvest PMF and transduce it to TonB. The carboxy terminus of TonB then physically interacts with outer membrane transporters to allow translocation of ligands into the periplasmic space. The structure of the TonB carboxy terminus (residues ~ 150 to 239) has been solved several times <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results.</b> <b>Our</b> previous <b>results</b> hinted that in vitro structures might not mimic the dimeric conformations that characterize TonB in vivo. To test structural predictions and to identify irreplaceable residues, the entire carboxy terminus of TonB was scanned with Cys substitutions. TonB I 232 C and N 233 C, predicted to efficiently form disulfide-linked dimers in the crystal structures, did not do so. In contrast, Cys substitutions positioned at large distances from {{one another in the}} crystal structures efficiently formed dimers. Cys scanning identified seven functionally important residues. However, no single residue was irreplaceable. The phenotypes conferred by changes of the seven residues depended on both the specific assay used and the residue substituted. All seven residues were synergistic with one another. The buried nature of the residues in the structures was also inconsistent with these properties. Taken together, these results indicate that the solved dimeric crystal structures of TonB do not exist.

DFT has been repeatedly implemented {{by a variety}} of tools for numerous purposes, including protection from zero-day and cross-site scripting attacks, detection and prevention of information leaks, and for the analysis of legitimate and malicious software. We present libdft, a dynamic DFT framework that unlike previous work is at once fast, reusable, and works with commodity software and hardware. libdft provides an API for building DFT-enabled tools that work on unmodified binaries, running on common operating systems and hardware, thus facilitating research and rapid prototyping. We explore different approaches for implementing the low-level aspects of instruction-level data tracking, introduce a more efficient and 64 -bit capable shadow memory, and identify (and avoid) the common pitfalls responsible for the excessive performance overhead of previous studies. We evaluate libdft using real applications with large codebases like the Apache and MySQL servers, and the Firefox web browser. We also use a series of benchmarks and utilities to compare libdft <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> systems. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> indicate that it performs at least as fast, if not faster, than previous solutions, and {{to the best of our}} knowledge, we are the first to evaluate the performance overhead of a fast dynamic DFT implementation in such depth.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemotherapeutic agents may {{be determined by}} a number of different factors, including the genotype of the tumor cell. The p 53 tumor suppressor gene frequently is mutated in human tumors, and this may contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance. We tested the requirement for wild-type p 53 in the response of tumor cells to treatment with paclitaxel (trade name Taxol), an antineoplastic agent that stabilizes cellular microtubules. Although paclitaxel is broadly effective against human tumor xenografts in mice, including some known to carry p 53 mutations, we found that p 53 -containing mouse tumor cells were significantly more sensitive to direct treatment with this drug than were p 53 -deficient tumor cells. In an attempt to reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we examined the requirement for p 53 in the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a cytokine released from murine macrophages upon paclitaxel treatment. Conditioned medium from paclitaxel-treated macrophages was capable of inducing p 53 -independent apoptosis when applied to transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts and was inhibitable by antibodies against TNF-α. Furthermore, in response to direct treatment with TNF-α, both wild-type and p 53 -deficient tumor cells underwent apoptosis to <b>similar</b> extents and <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> kinetics. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> suggest that the {{efficacy of}} paclitaxel in vivo may be due not only to its microtubule-stabilizing activity, but its ability to activate local release of an apoptosis-inducing cytokine...|$|R

40|$|A {{commonly}} experienced {{problem with}} population based optimisation methods is the gradual {{decline in population}} diversity that tends to occur over time. This can slow a system’s progress or even halt it completely if the population converges on a local optimum from which it cannot escape. In this paper we present the Fitness Uniform Deletion Scheme (FUDS), a simple but somewhat unconventional approach to this problem. Under FUDS the deletion operation is modified to only delete those individuals which are “common” {{in the sense that}} there exist many other individuals of similar fitness in the population.

In this paper we present canonical time warping (CTW), an extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for spatio-temporal alignment of the behavior between two subjects. CTW extends previous work on CCA in two ways: (i) it combines CCA with dynamic time warping for temporal alignment; and (ii) it extends CCA to allow local spatial deformations. We show CTW’s effectiveness in three experiments: alignment of synthetic data, alignment of motion capture data of two subjects performing similar actions, and alignment of two people <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> facial expressions. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> demonstrate that CTW provides both visually and qualitatively better alignment than state-of-the-art techniques based on dynamic time warping...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified embryo-specific (emb) mutations {{that resulted in}} maize kernels containing abnormal embryos with normal-appearing endosperm among the progeny of active Robertson’s Mutator stocks. Our rationale for the mutant screen described {{here is that it}} should be possible to produce ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) -induced emb mutations at a frequency higher than that obtained by transposon mutagenesis and with greater ease. This proved to be the case when we screened for mutations that are embryo-specific among progeny of materials generated with EMS-treated pollen. The EMS-induced emb mutation frequency reported here is nearly three times the 4. 5 % we obtained with the transposable element stocks. The 45 mutants reported here were all tested for germination capacity and nearly all were lethal. The embryo phenotypes of 34 mutations were examined by dissection of the mature embryos. All were found to be retarded in development and morphologically abnormal. Half of the mutants in this group were blocked in the proembryo and transition stages. They likely include mutations in nuclear genes coding for plastid proteins. The other 17 are mainly blocked in the coleoptilar stage, or in later stages with a low frequency. This group likely includes mutations in genes regulating the completion of shoot apical meristem (SAM) development and accompanying morphogenetic events. Most of the complementation tests using 19 of the mutations in 35 unique combinations complimented each other, except for two pairs of mutations <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> phenotypes. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> provide additional evidence for the presence of many emb loci in the maize genome...|$|R

Meteorites show that dynamics was important in determining the dust distribution in the Solar Nebula {{and needs to be}} considered if we are to understand the global chemistry in discs. 1 D radial condensation sequences can only simulate one disc layer at a time and cannot describe the global chemistry or the complexity of meteorites. To address these limitations, we compute {{for the first time the}} two dimensional distribution of condensates in the inner Solar Nebula using a thermodynamic equilibrium model, and derive timescales for vertical settling and radial migration of dust. We find two enstatite-rich zones within 1 AU from the young Sun: a band ~ 0. 1 AU thick in the upper optically-thin layer of the disc interior to 0. 8 AU, and in the optically-thick disc midplane out to ~ 0. 4 AU. The two enstatite-rich zones support recent evidence that Mercury and enstatite chondrites shared a bulk material <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> composition. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> are also consistent with infrared observation of protoplanetary disc which show emission of enstatite-rich dust in the inner surface of discs.

40|$|Large scale {{structure}} surveys {{promise to}} be the next leading probe of cosmological information. It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their observables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) provides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear regime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion of the wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the non-linear scale k_nl. Since most of the information is contained at high wavenumbers, it is necessary to compute higher order corrections to correlation functions. After the one-loop correction to the matter power spectrum, we estimate that the next leading one is the two-loop contribution, which we compute here. At this order in k/k_nl, there is only one counterterm in the EFTofLSS that must be included, though this term contributes both at tree-level and in several one-loop diagrams. We also discuss correlation functions involving the velocity and momentum fields. We find that the EFTofLSS prediction at two loops matches to percent accuracy the non-linear matter power spectrum at redshift zero up to k~ 0. 6 h/Mpc, requiring just one unknown coefficient that needs to be fit to observations. Given that Standard Perturbation Theory stops converging at redshift zero at k~ 0. 1 h/Mpc, <b>our</b> <b>results</b> demonstrate the possibility of accessing a factor of order 200 more dark matter quasi-linear modes than naively expected.

We examined the molecular basis of the different response of channels containing SUR 1 and SUR 2 A, by recording currents from inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing wild-type or chimeric channels.

This effect was not specific for meglitinide, as tolbutamide was also unable to prevent MgADP activation of Kir 6. 2 /SUR 128 currents. The data favour the idea that meglitinide binding to SUR 1 impairs either MgADP binding or the transduction pathway between the NBDs and Kir 6. 2, and that TMs 8 - 11 {{are involved in this}} modulatory response.

40|$|Elevational {{gradients}} {{of biodiversity}} {{have been widely}} investigated, and yet a clear interpretation of the biotic and abiotic factors that determine how species richness varies with elevation is still elusive. In mountainous landscapes, habitats at different elevations are characterized by different areal extent and connectivity properties key drivers of biodiversity, as predicted by metacommunity theory. However, most previous studies directly correlated species richness to elevational gradients of potential drivers, thus neglecting the interplay between such gradients and the environmental matrix. Here, we investigate the role of geomorphology in shaping patterns of species richness. We develop a spatially explicit zero-sum metacommunity model where species have an elevation-dependent fitness and otherwise neutral traits. Results show that ecological dynamics over complex terrains lead to the null expectation of a hump-shaped elevational gradient of species richness, a pattern widely observed empirically. Local species richness {{is found to be}} related to the landscape elevational connectivity, as quantified by a newly proposed metric that applies tools of complex network theory to measure the closeness of a site to others <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> habitat. <b>Our</b> theoretical <b>results</b> suggest clear geomorphic controls on elevational gradients of species richness and support the use of the landscape elevational connectivity as a null model for the analysis of the distribution of biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|The key organic {{constituents}} of marine macroaggregates (macrogels) of prevalently phytoplankton origin, periodically {{occurring in the}} northern Adriatic Sea, are proteins, lipids and especially polysaccharides. In this article, the reactivity of various macroaggregate fractions {{in relation to their}} composition in order to decode the potentially »bioavailable« fractions is summarized and discussed. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the macroaggregate matrix, using α-amylase, β-glucosidase, protease, proteinase and lipase, revealed the simultaneous degradation of polysaccharides and proteins, while lipids seem largely preserved. In the fresh surface macroaggregate samples, a pronounced degradation of the α-glycosidic bond compared to β-linkages. Degradation of the colloidal fraction proceeded faster in the higher molecular weight (MW) fractions. N-containing polysaccharides can be important {{constituents of}} the higher MW fraction while the lower MW constituents can mostly be composed of poly- and oligosaccharides. Since the polysaccharide component in the higher MW fraction is more degradable compared to N-containing polysaccharides, the higher MW fraction represents a possible path of organic nitrogen preservation. Enzymatic hydrolysis, using α-amylase and β-glucosidase, revealed the presence of α- and β-glycosidic linkages in all fractions <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> decomposition kinetics. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> indicate that different fractions of macroaggregates are subjected to compositional selective reactivity with important implications for macroaggregate persistence in the seawater column and deposition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSo far, {{there is}} no {{genome-wide}} estimation of the mutational spectrum in humans. In this study, we systematically examined the directionality of the point mutations and maintenance of GC content in the human genome using ∼ 1. 8 million high-quality human single nucleotide polymorphisms and their ancestral sequences in chimpanzees. The frequency of C→T (G→A) changes was the highest among all mutation types {{and the frequency of}} each type of transition was approximately fourfold that of each type of transversion. In intergenic regions, when the GC content increased, the frequency of changes from G or C increased. In exons, the frequency of G:C→A:T was the highest among the genomic categories and contributed mainly by the frequent mutations at the CpG sites. In contrast, mutations at the CpG sites, or CpG→TpG/CpA mutations, occurred less frequently in the CpG islands relative to intergenic regions <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> GC content. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> suggest that the GC content is overall not in equilibrium in the human genome, with a trend toward shifting the human genome to be AT rich and shifting the GC content of a region to approach the genome average. <b>Our</b> <b>results,</b> which differ from previous estimates based on limited loci or on the rodent lineage, provide the first representative and reliable mutational spectrum in the recent human genome and categorized genomic regions...|$|R
40|$|Identifying the {{determinants}} of population growth rate is a central topic in population ecology. Three approaches (demographic, mechanistic and density-dependent) used historically to describe the {{determinants of}} population growth rate are here compared and combined for an avian predator, the barn owl (Tyto alba). The owl population remained approximately stable (r approximately 0) throughout the period from 1979 to 1991. There {{was no evidence of}} density dependence as assessed by goodness of fit to logistic population growth. The finite (lambda) and instantaneous (r) population growth rates were significantly positively related to food (field vole) availability. The demographic rates, annual adult mortality, juvenile mortality and annual fecundity were reported to be correlated with vole abundance. The best fit (R(2) = 0. 82) numerical response of the owl population described a positive effect of food (field voles) and a negative additive effect of owl abundance on r. The numerical response of the barn owl population to food availability was estimated from both census and demographic data, <b>with</b> very <b>similar</b> <b>results.</b> <b>Our</b> analysis shows how the demographic and mechanistic determinants of population growth rate are linked; food availability determines demographic rates, and demographic rates determine population growth rate. The effects of food availability on population growth rate are modified by predator abundance...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Association pattern {{discovery}} (APD) {{methods have}} been successfully applied to gene expression data. They find groups of co-regulated genes in which the genes are either up- or down-regulated throughout the identified conditions. These methods, however, fail to identify similarly expressed genes whose expressions change between up- and down-regulation from one condition to another. In order to discover these hidden patterns, we propose the concept of mining co-regulated gene profiles. Co-regulated gene profiles contain two gene sets such that genes within the same set behave identically (up or down) while genes from different sets display contrary behavior. To reduce and group {{the large number of}} similar resulting patterns, we propose a new similarity measure that can be applied together with hierarchical clustering methods. Results: We tested our proposed method on two well-known yeast microarray data sets. Our implementation mined the data effectively and discovered patterns of co-regulated genes that are hidden to traditional APD methods. The high content of biologically relevant information in these patterns is demonstrated by the significant enrichment of co-regulated genes <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> functions. <b>Our</b> experimental <b>results</b> show that the Mining Attribute Profile (MAP) method is an efficient tool for the analysis of gene expression data and competitive with bi-clustering techniques.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of shared virtual memory protocols on large-scale multicomputers. Using experiments on a 64 -node Paragon, we show that the traditional Lazy Release Consistency (LRC) protocol does not scale well, {{because of the large}} number of messages it requires, the large amount of memory it consumes for protocol overhead data, and because of the diÆculty of garbage collecting that data. To achieve more scalable performance, we introduce and evaluate two new protocols. The rst, Home-based LRC (HLRC), is based on the Automatic Update Release Con-sistency (AURC) protocol. Like AURC, HLRC maintains a home for each page to which all updates are propagated and from which all copies are derived. Unlike AURC, HLRC requires no specialized hardware support. We nd that the use of homes provides substantial improvements in performance and scalability over LRC. Our second protocol, called Overlapped Home-based LRC (OHLRC), takes advantage of the communication processor found on each node of the Paragon to ooad some of the protocol overhead of HLRC from the critical path followed by the compute processor. We nd that OHLRC provides modest improvements over HLRC. We also apply overlapping to the base LRC protocol, <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results.</b> <b>Our</b> experiments were done using ve of the Splash- 2 benchmarks. We report overall execution times, as well as detailed breakdowns of elapsed time, message traÆc, and memory use for each of the protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Industrial Engineering and the Institute of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2010. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 94 - 99. In this thesis, we {{analyze the}} problem of pricing and hedging contingent claims in the multi-period, discrete time, discrete state case. We work on both European and American type contingent claims. For European contingent claims, we analyze the problem using {{the concept of a}} “λ gain-loss ratio opportunity”. Pricing results which are somewhat different from, but reminiscent of, the arbitrage pricing theorems of mathematical finance are obtained. Our analysis provides tighter price bounds on the contingent claim in an incomplete market, which may converge to a unique price for a specific value of a gain-loss preference parameter imposed by the market while the hedging policies may be different for different sides of the same trade. The results are obtained in the simpler framework of stochastic linear programming in a multiperiod setting. They also extend to markets with transaction costs. Until now, determining the buyer’s price for American contingent claims (ACC) required solving an integer program unlike European contingent claims for which solving a linear program is sufficient. We show that a relaxation of the integer programming problem which is a linear program, can be used to get the buyer’s price for an ACC. We also study {{the problem of}} computing the lower hedging price of an American contingent claim in a market where proportional transaction costs exist. We derive a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for calculating the lower hedging price. We also present and discuss an alternative, aggregate formulation <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> properties. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> imply that it might be optimal for the holder of several identical American claims to exercise portions of the portfolio at different time points in the presence of proportional transaction costs while this incentive disappears in their absence. We also exhibit some counterexamples for some new ideas based on our work. We believe that these counterexamples are important in determining the direction of research on the subject. Camcı, AhmetPh.
