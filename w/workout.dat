5|$|For {{many years}} Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after {{fracturing}} her foot while filming The China Syndrome, {{she was no}} longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni <b>Workout</b> became the Jane Fonda <b>Workout,</b> which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's <b>Workout,</b> inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's <b>Workout</b> Book. Jane Fonda's <b>Workout</b> became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the <b>workout</b> at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 <b>workout</b> videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five <b>workout</b> books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.|$|E

This is great for building sprint endurance, which is required in competitions where the athlete is sprinting down the runway 3-6 times. Typical <b>workouts</b> would include 5×150 m.

He contributed 11points and eight rebounds as his East team lost to the West 113–108. Chad Ford of ESPN said that Allen was the 99th best {{prospect}} in the 2011 NBA draft. Allen sprained his ankle in a <b>workout</b> with his hometown Philadelphia 76ers {{and was forced to}} miss the next <b>workout</b> with the New Jersey Nets. The Sixers were not overly concerned with the injury, as they drafted him in the second round with the 50th pick on June23.

The San Diego Chargers had the number-one selection but traded it to Atlanta Falcons {{the day before the}} draft for the Falcons' first- and third-round picks in 2001. Vick was taken in the 30th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, despite not playing baseball since the 8th grade.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypertrophy}} range (8 - 12 repetitions at 70 - 85 % one-repetition maximum (1 RM)) {{has long}} been considered the optimal resistance training protocol {{for the development of}} fat-free mass (FFM). Recent investigations have hypothesized that lighter repetition zones (over 12 repetitions and less than 67 % 1 RM) are as effective as heavier loads for the development of FFM. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether local muscular endurance <b>workouts</b> could sustain and further increase FFM following a program emphasizing the hypertrophy zone. Methods: Healthy, untrained subjects (36 men and 27 women, ages 23 ± 3) completed 96 resistance training <b>workouts.</b> After baseline testing (T 1), testing of body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI)) and performance occurred after every 32 <b>workouts</b> (at T 2, T 3, and T 4). In the first block of 32 <b>workouts,</b> 2 of every 3 <b>workouts</b> emphasized the hypertrophy zone and 1 / 3 emphasized the strength zone (3 - 7 repetitions at 83 to 93 % 1 RM). Of the last 32 <b>workouts,</b> 28 % of the <b>workouts</b> were in the hypertrophy zone, 47 % in the strength zone, and 1 / 4 in the local muscular endurance zone. Results: FFM significantly increased from T 1 (49. 8 ± 10. 0 kg) until T 3 (52. 6 ± 10. 5 kg), at which point it significantly decreased to T 4 (52. 2 ± 10. 7 kg). Squat strength and bone mineral density significantly increased, but vertical jump power production did not continue to increase between T 3 and T 4. Discussion: This investigation suggests that replacing hypertrophy-zone <b>workouts</b> with endurance zone <b>workouts</b> prevents further increases in FFM and results in a loss of FFM previously gained...|$|R

40|$|From {{around the}} last half of the 1990 s, the {{proportion}} of bank-led <b>workouts</b> on debts held by troubled companies has been decreasing, while there has been a sharp rise in the number of cases of court-administered reorganization proceedings under the Corporate Reorganization Law or the Civil Rehabilitation Law. This paper empirically analyzes the effects of debt composition on the selection of <b>workouts</b> or court-administered reorganizations with respect to Japanese companies subjected to either <b>workouts</b> or court-administered reorganization proceedings between January 1997 and December 2003, using these companies' financial data for the business term immediately prior to bankruptcy. <b>Workouts</b> with debt relief from creditor banks have been applied primarily to large-scale companies. On the other hand, court-administered reorganization is more likely to be selected than <b>workouts</b> when a significant portion of outstanding debts is from the state-controlled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and its successor Shinsei Bank, or when the proportion of bonds as a share of total debts is relatively high. Also, the proportion of unsecured loans is significantly higher for sample companies in <b>workouts</b> cases than those of court-administered reorganization cases. With respect to relationships with main creditor banks, the greater the share of outstanding debts held by the leading creditor bank, the greater is the possibility that <b>workouts</b> will be selected for reorganizing the debtor company. It is hoped this paper, which is a rare attempt to analyze the selection of either <b>workouts</b> or court-administered proceedings in corporate reorganization, will make meaningful contribution to exploring ways to reorganize Japanese companies in the future. ...|$|R
5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved <b>workout</b> regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E
