5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued after the system moved inland. Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> a result of the poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E
