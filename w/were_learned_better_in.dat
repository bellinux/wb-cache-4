40|$|When we do {{not know}} how to {{correctly}} behave in a new context, the emotions that people familiar with the context show in response to the behaviors of others, can help us understand what to do or not to do. The present study examined cross-cultural differences in how group emotional expressions (anger, sadness, neutral) can be used to deduce a norm violation in four cultures (Germany, Israel, Greece and the US), which differ in terms of decoding rules for negative emotions. As expected, in all four countries, anger was a stronger norm violation signal than sadness or neutral expressions. However, angry and sad expressions were perceived as more intense and the relevant norm <b>was</b> <b>learned</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> Germany and Israel than in Greece and the US. Participants in Greece were relatively better at using sadness as a sign of a likely norm violation. The results demonstrate both cultural universality and cultural differences in the use of group emotion expressions in norm learning. In terms of cultural differences they underscore that the social signal value of emotional expressions may vary with culture as a function of cultural differences, both in emotion perception, and as a function of a differential use of emotions...|$|R

I had intended, in conclusion, gentlemen, {{to incur}} such blame of {{presumption}} {{as might be}} involved in offering some hints for present practical methods in architectural schools, but here again I am checked, as I have been throughout, {{by a sense of}} the uselessness of all minor means, and helps, without the establishment of a true and broad educational system. My wish would be to see the profession of the architect united, not with that of the engineer, but of the sculptor. I think there should be a separate school and university course for engineers, in which the principal branches of study connected with that of practical building should be the physical and exact sciences, and honors should be taken in mathematics; but I think there should be another school and university course for the sculptor and architect, in which literature and philosophy should be the associated branches of study, and honors should be taken in literis humanioribus; and I think a young architect's examination for his degree (for mere pass), should be much stricter than that of youths intending to enter other professions.

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{language}} teachers apply practical experiences from computer-assisted language learning (CALL) coursework to their teaching. It also examines ways in which teachers continue their CALL professional development. Participants in the study were 20 English as a second language and foreign language teachers who had, within the last 4 years, completed the same graduate-level CALL course and who are currently teaching. Surveys and follow-up interviews explored how participants learn about CALL activities; how what they learned in the course interacts with their current teaching contexts; the factors that influence whether or not they use technology in their classrooms; and how they continue to acquire and master new ideas in CALL. The findings support previous research on technology teacher education as it suggests that teachers who use CALL activities are often those teachers who had experience with CALL prior to taking the course; that lack of time, support, and resources prohibits the use of CALL activities in some classrooms; and that colleagues are the most common resource of new CALL activity ideas outside of formal coursework.

40|$|Criteria and {{indicators}} (C&I) {{have been}} worldwide {{accepted as a}} way to conceptualize and measure sustainability of forest management. Various C&I sets or standards were formulated by different organizations and processes such as ITTO, CIFOR, FSC, ATO and MontrÃ©al Process. These standards, particularly in the production aspect, underline the sustained forest yield principle and the importance of using permanent sample plot data to regulate forest yield. This principle can only be achieved when the forest yield is regulated according to its dynamics and growth which is unique for each site and unlikely to be completely known. As a result, no single yield regulation can be implemented across areas and dynamic complex interaction between forest and people. Any yield regulation practice has to be considered as a hypothesis.

Abercrombie (1969) reminds us that we rarely reflect upon our initial judgements, which are embedded in our own personality. Abercrombie found that group discussion helped these students solve such problems and, in particular, improved the ability of the students to discriminate between facts and opinions, to resist false conclusions and to bring fresh strategies to their attempts to solve new problems without being adversely influenced by past failure. The ideas put forward by Jane Abercrombie about the development of small group interactive learning pedagogies in the 1960s in the UK had an almost immediate impact on the primary and tertiary education sectors there.

In this study 24 months old male rats were used. Rats were divided into control and Minocycline groups and injected intraperitoneally (ip) for 25 days. <b>Learning</b> experiments <b>were</b> performed using Morris water maze.

It contains a literature review of commercial and humanitarian supply chain literature as well as a review of Pettit and Beresford (2006) framework of supply chain Critical Success Factors, which was used as a framework of analysis in chapter 4. The methodology used were borrowed aspects(coding procedures and paradigm) of Strauss and Corbinâ€™s (1990) grounded theory which was supported by data collected from primary sources (survey and interviews) and secondary sources. The results are presented after each analysis chapter.

This tendency has blown to China since its open-up to the world in late 1970 s and the Chinese form of inclusive education, which is commonly known as Learning in Regular Classrooms (LRC) has now become the main approach to satisfying educational needs of students with disabilities. However, Chinese LRC is originally based on a pragmatic thinking to provide more students with disabilities with quality education, due to the fact that there are not enough special schools for a huge population of children and adolescents with disabilities. The country and its competent authorities have made a bunch of policies to support and promote the development of LRC, however, the practice is not always consistent with what is written in documents. Furthermore, unique Chinese culture and different local traditions and actualities decide that the development of inclusive education in China has to go along with its own characteristics. This thesis tries to describe the current situation of inclusive education in Beijing through in-service inclusive teachersâ€™ perspectives, so as to provide an angle to learn the overall developmental situation of inclusive education in China. The research reveals Beijing teachersâ€™ perspectives on inclusive education, their opinions, concerns and expectations, which are categorised into four main groups â€“ parental, classroom-based, administrative and personal. The results turned out that Beijing teachers in inclusive classrooms were properly supported, while they were showing their expectation on more support.

40|$|The {{rendering}} of abstract information as objects and events in apparently-concrete three-dimensional virtual worlds has profound {{implications for the}} way people relate to information. The importance of these developments for education are obvious, but the benefits are not so straightforward. The hallmark of virtual reality {{is the sense of}} presence, the feeling that one is actually there, within the virtual world. We discuss aspects of feeling present, including time perception and bodily responses, and their relation to conceptual versus perceptual information processing. In conceptual learning we typically develop an internal conscious model of relevant aspects of the external world. In perceptual learning we interact with the external world via increasingly unconscious skills. Several authors have pointed to the importance of navigational features in virtual worlds, to allow people to use their real world navigational skills when dealing with virtual worlds of information. We present results from comparative studies of students learning to find their way around virtual worlds of varying closeness to the physical world. One finding was that students preferred the more object-based and less textual worlds, and felt a greater sense of presence there, but <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> no <b>better.</b> <b>In</b> another study, hypertext proved much more effective than an equivalent virtual world, though the sense of presence in hypertext was significantly less. What <b>is</b> important in <b>learning</b> depends on the kind of knowledge to be acquired and what the student intends to do with it. Often, our evaluations of new modes of information presentation presuppose explicit, conscious, reportable knowledge as the goal. This may bias our interpretation of results in favour of entrenched technologies. On the other hand, exploration is not necessarily the best way to learn about unknown territory; reading a good guidebook may well make any excursions more worthwhile. In educational settings, we need to deliberately control the sense of presence to facilitate both vivid experiences and generalisable conceptual learning. ...|$|R
40|$|Children {{and adults}} <b>are</b> able to <b>learn</b> a motor {{sequence}} quickly, usually over {{a course of}} one learning session consisting of 4 - 8 learning blocks. This initial acquisition {{is referred to as}} fast <b>learning.</b> However, little <b>is</b> known about the learning processes underlying the fast acquisition of motor sequences. Therefore, the overarching objective of this dissertation was to examine the underlying processes that drive rapid motor sequence learning in children and adults. In a series of studies, children and adults performed a modified serial reaction time (SRT) task, a primary window into understanding implicit motor sequence learning. Study I demonstrated that fast learning of implicit motor sequences in six- and 10 -year-old children was comparable to adults, while the performance (i. e., reaction time, RT) during <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> reflected by two age-related processes. Learning in six-year-old children dominantly relied on an offline process where RT improved after a short rest, while offline enhancement as well as online progressive improvement in RT reflected sequence learning in 10 -year-old children and adults. In studies II, III, and IV, we demonstrated that the online and offline processes were neither by-products of task pacing constraints nor illusory effects of fatigue or reactive inhibition. Instead, these two age-related processes {{were more likely to be}} functional mechanisms underlying implicit motor sequence <b>learning,</b> which could <b>be</b> modulated by the involvement of procedural and declarative memory. In addition, study III characterized the developmental landscape of 5 - to 14 -year-old children and found that the developmental changes of online and offline <b>learning</b> <b>were</b> primarily present in early childhood. As fast <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> known to enable generalization (or transfer) of sequences learning, we expected, given the findings in studies I through IV, age-related differences in the generalization of implicit motor sequence learning. The results in study V, interestingly, demonstrated that the generalization of implicit motor sequence <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>in</b> children than in adults. However, in study VI, when greater procedural memory was required in the SRT task, learning in adults largely depended on offline learning; and, the age-related differences in learning generalization vanished, suggesting that offline learning may facilitate the generalization of implicit motor sequence learning. Taken together, results from these studies found two age-related learning processes (i. e., online and offline learning) that drive the fast implicit sequence acquisition and demonstrated that the age-related online and offline learning may lead to children a superior ability in the generalization of motor sequence learning. These results extend our understanding of the age-related development of implicit motor sequence learning and provide potential insights into the question of why childhood is an optimal period for learning...|$|R

40|$|The {{central focus}} {{of this study is}} to characterise {{classroom}} talk (CT) from the Dialogicity perspective and relate this characterisation to pupilsâ€Ÿ learning. It aims particularly to reflect on and develop the concept of Dialogicity as a theoretical perspective for characterising the nature of CT in relation to both teaching and learning. The study developed an analytical framework to analyse CT based on further characterising the Authoritative and Dialogic types of talk as defined by the communicative approach of Mortimer and Scott (2003). Data was generated by videotaping grade nine Omani science classes and probing the conceptual understanding of samples of pupils from these classes using bubble dialogue sheets and focus group discussions. This exploration was carried out in two stages separated by a short teacher training intervention designed to promote the practice of dialogic talk. The results demonstrated a quite big change in CT practice between the two stages, with more incidents of Dialogic talk in the second stage. Detailed analysis revealed a number of features characterising the Authoritative and Dialogic communicative approaches. Furthermore, it demonstrated different kinds of CT that were to be judged as Authoritative and others as Dialogic. This has resulted in viewing each type of talk along three general levels of high, mid and low. Consequently, the study has developed the communicative approach to a â€žmulti-level Authoritative-Dialogicâ€Ÿ model. Deeper reflection on this model, as characterising CT Dialogicity at the empirical level, led to propose the â€žless-moreâ€Ÿ dialogic model to approach CT Dialogicity at the theoretical level. The study argues that the continuity view of Dialogicity that this theoretical model is based on might be helpful in developing the concept of Dialogicity as a perspective in approaching the nature of CT. In investigating the relationship between CT Dialogicity and learning, the study looked into learning as a process and as a product. General results pointed to the superiority of Dialogic talk in supporting pupilsâ€Ÿ learning over Authoritative talk, in the terms of pupilsâ€Ÿ engagement, cognitive level of questions and responses and the conceptual understanding following from the teaching. However, the study argues that it is not possible to establish a constant claim on this superiority because the comparison between the two types can be approached differently, depending upon which of their levels are being compared. Alternatively, it suggests that the relationship between CT Dialogicity and <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> approached <b>in</b> the light of the continuity view within the â€žless-moreâ€Ÿ dialogic model. Accordingly, different claims on the advantages of more dialogic talk over less dialogic in supporting pupilsâ€Ÿ <b>learning</b> have <b>been</b> suggested. In addition, the results illustrated a resonance between the pupilsâ€Ÿ conceptual understanding and difficulties and what happened in the preceding teaching. In summarising the relationship between CT Dialogicity, teaching and learning, the study asserts that <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> closely connected to the CT characterisation from the Dialogicity perspective, and does not stand in isolation from teaching. Different implications for research and teacher training have been raised in view of the studyâ€Ÿs methodological practices and findings...|$|R

This research used the quasi experimental research method with the factorial design of 3 x 3. Its population was {{all of the students}} in Grade VIII of State Junior Secondary Schools of Bengkulu Selatan Regency, Bengkulu Province in Academic Year 2014 / 2015. The samples of research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The balance test of research used the one-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The pre-requisite test of ANAVA used Lilliefors 2 Ì† 7 s normality test, Bartlett 2 Ì† 7 s homogeneity test. The proposed hypotheses of research were tested by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of research are as follows: 1) the PBL model results <b>in</b> a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than the DL and CL models, and the DL model results <b>in</b> a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than the CL model; 2) the students with the high interpersonal intelligence have a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than those with the moderate and low interpersonal intelligences, and the students with the moderate interpersonal intelligence have a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> Mathematics than those with the low interpersonal intelligence; 3) in each interpersonal intelligence level, the PBL model results <b>in</b> a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than the DL and CL models, and the DL model results <b>in</b> a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than the CL model; 4) in each learning model, the students with the high interpersonal intelligence have a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than those with the moderate and low interpersonal intelligences, and the students with the moderate interpersonal intelligence have a <b>better</b> <b>learning</b> achievement <b>in</b> mathematics than those with the low interpersonal intelligence...|$|R
