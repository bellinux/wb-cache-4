2500|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the Lost Hills {{operations is}} the pronounced subsidence {{of the ground}} surface as it collapses into the area vacated by the petroleum after being pumped out. Portions of the hills overlying the oil field have subsided up to [...] in the central region of operations, and subsidence occurs field-wide {{at a rate of}} about [...] per year. The dropping land surface causes operational problems, including fractures of well casings, and sometimes complete well failures. <b>Waterflooding</b> – the practice of filling the reservoir with water to push petroleum to recovery wells, and thereby also reoccupying the space vacated by oil and gas – has partially mitigated the problem. Some wells have actually disappeared into craters: in 1976, a Getty Oil well blew out, and quickly collapsed into a crater over [...] deep and , taking with it the concrete pad, casing, and pumping unit. Yet another Getty well suffered the same fate in 1978.|$|E

30|$|The Buckley–Leverett {{displacement}} mechanism {{has been}} used to predict the performance of <b>waterflood.</b> With Buckley–Leverett method, oil recovery from <b>waterflood</b> is calculated and required water injection volume to achieve that oil recovery is estimated. This method does provide a very useful tool in <b>waterflood</b> design. Our experience in oil industry and a thorough literature review indicates that Buckley–Leverett method was used to analyze <b>waterflood</b> project directly without any adjustment based on the real reservoir and production situations. By doing so, errors are introduced into the analysis. Buckley–Leverett method assumed that displacement occurs in a linear system. This is true for some <b>waterflood</b> scenarios while for others it is not. For some <b>waterflood</b> scenarios, a radial system is more appropriate than a linear system. In this study, we investigated the fractional flow in a radial system and derived the solutions to predict the performance of water displacing oil in radial system. With this radial displacement model, design and prediction of <b>waterflood</b> can be achieved by Buckley–Leverett method and our model, whichever fits the <b>waterflood</b> pattern. Considering the fact that many <b>waterflood</b> scenarios follow radial displacement, our model is an important supplement to Buckley–Leverett method.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that Buckley–Leverett method and all the {{aforementioned}} studies assumed that displacement occurs in a linear system. This is true for some <b>waterflood</b> scenarios, while for others it is not. Our experience in oil industry and a thorough literature review indicates that petroleum engineers used Buckley–Leverett method to analyze the <b>waterflood</b> project directly without any adjustment based on the real reservoir and production situations such as production-injection patterns. By doing so, a lot of errors are introduced into the analysis. For some <b>waterflood</b> scenarios, a radial system is more appropriate than a linear system. Therefore, a radial displacement model is a necessary supplement to Buckley–Leverett linear displacement model. With both displacement models, design and prediction of <b>waterflood</b> can be achieved by selecting the appropriate model that fits the <b>waterflood</b> pattern. Considering the fact that many <b>waterflood</b> scenarios follow radial displacement, our model is very useful in field application.|$|R
50|$|As {{production}} {{began its}} inevitable decline, Shell commenced <b>waterflooding</b> operations to increase reservoir pressure {{and dispose of}} produced water. <b>Waterflooding</b> ran from 1963 to 1968 in the G, H, I, and J zones.|$|E
50|$|To achieve maximum oil recovery, <b>waterflooding</b> {{is often}} implemented, in which water is {{injected}} into the reservoirs to help force the oil to the production wells.

They were ranked so as to reduce disparities between the simulated and actual reservoir properties. These models were then employed in reservoir simulation and <b>waterflood</b> performance analysis.

40|$|A {{reservoir}} engineering {{study was}} conducted of <b>waterflood</b> performance in the South Cowden field, an Upper Permian Grayburg reservoir on the Central Basin Platform in West Texas. The study was undertaken to understand the historically poor <b>waterflood</b> performance, evaluate three techniques for incorporating petrophysical measurements and geological interpretation into heterogeneous reservoir models, and identify issues in heterogeneity modeling and fluid-flow scaleup that require further research. The approach included analysis of relative permeability data, analysis of injection and production data, heterogeneity modeling, and <b>waterflood</b> simulation. The poor South Cowden <b>waterflood</b> recovery is due, in part, to completion of wells in only {{the top half of}} the formation. Recompletion of wells through the entire formation is estimated to improve recovery in ten years by 6 percent of the original oil in place in some areas of the field. A direct three-dimensional stochastic approach to heterogeneity modeling produced the best fit to <b>waterflood</b> performance and injectivity, but a more conventional model based on smooth mapping of layer-averaged properties was almost as good. The results reaffirm the importance of large-scale heterogeneities in <b>waterflood</b> modeling but demonstrate only a slight advantage for stochastic modeling at this scale. All the flow simulations required a reduction to the measured whole-core k{sub v}/k{sub h} to explain <b>waterflood</b> behavior, suggesting the presence of barriers to vertical flow not explicitly accounted for in any of the heterogeneity models. They also required modifications to the measured steady-state relative permeabilities, suggesting the importance of small-scale heterogeneities and scaleup. Vertical flow barriers, small-scale heterogeneity modeling, and relative permeability scaleup require additional research for <b>waterflood</b> performance prediction in reservoirs like South Cowden...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Two-and three-dimensional simulation studies have been carried out to evaluate <b>waterflood</b> oil recovery in a 40 -acre 5 -spot pattern using horizontal and vertical well systems. The three-dimensional simulation results indicate that the parameters considered, i. e. vertical permeability-horizontal permeability ratio, injection and production rates, and reservoir thickness have little effect on <b>waterflood</b> oil recovery for a particular water-oil mobility ratio. For both vertical and horizontal well systems, oil recovery decreases with increasing water-oil mobility ratio. It is concluded that the water-oil mobility ratio is the dominant parameter affecting <b>waterflood</b> oil recovery, in line with the experimental results of Craig-Geffen-Morse for conventional <b>waterflood.</b> <b>Waterflood</b> oil recovery using a horizontal well system is shown to be higher than that based on a vertical well system. In addition, maximum oil recovery is obtained using a horizontal well with maximum horizontal section open to flow. A correlation has been developed which expresses volumetric sweep efficiency in a 5 -spot pattern as a function of water-oil mobility ratio. This correlation would be useful for estimating <b>waterflood</b> oil recovery for the range of reservoir parameters considered...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} reservoir pressure, several <b>waterflooding</b> projects have been undertaken on the field, commencing in 1955.

50|$|Having {{built up}} such {{momentum}} in its oil production as it entered the 1990s, the Company fully expected the trend to continue. Unfortunately, the Company’s field-development {{strategy for the}} start of the 21st century - based on incremental infill drilling with horizontal wells and extensive <b>waterflooding</b> - had its momentum dissipated before the <b>waterflooding</b> projects, which require comprehensive reservoir studies, could be fully implemented. The natural production-rate decline of its major oil fields eventually caught up with the Company at the start of the millennium. And to make matters worse, its business had fundamentally changed: its new fields were coming in smaller sizes; its new wells were delivering less oil; its costs were going up. The fact was that the Company’s operating model - the way it was carrying out its business - was not sustainable in the longer term.|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity of}} producing oil reservoirs optimally by improving oil recovery, minimizing water production and better maintenance of reservoir pressure, engineers are plagued with challenges such as optimal completions zones for injectors and producers, optimal flood pattern to adopt and number/type of producers and injectors {{to use in}} oil field <b>waterflood</b> development. These problems are commonly encountered in <b>waterflood</b> operations.|$|R
30|$|When {{reservoir}} engineers {{analyze the}} <b>waterflood</b> performance, they {{resort to the}} conventional frontal advance theory of Buckley and Leverett (1942). With Buckley–Leverett method, oil recovery from <b>waterflood</b> is calculated and required water injection volume to achieve that oil recovery is estimated. This method does provide a very useful tool in <b>waterflood</b> design. Welge (1952) proposed a tangent construction method to estimate the water saturation, water fraction at the water front and oil recovery factor. Several other investigators studied the multilayer reservoir <b>waterflood</b> performance. Stiles (1949) investigated the multilayer reservoir displacement by assuming the displacement velocity in a layer to be proportional to its absolute permeability. Dykstra and Parsons (1950) developed their famous multi-permeability model for noncommunicating layers without crossflow. Hearn (1971) derived expressions for communicating stratified reservoirs using the pseudo-relative permeability functions. El–Khatib (1999) advanced the closed form analytical solution for communicating stratified systems with log-normal permeability distributions.

The scope of this research does not include creating an actual development and production strategy that can be implemented in this field of interest. Rather, it involves using reservoir simulation techniques to optimize oil recovery from the reservoir by carrying out comparative analysis on several factors that influence production and <b>waterflood</b> performance in any given reservoir, such as zones of injection and production (ZoIP), <b>waterflood</b> pattern (PoWF) and number/types of injectors and producers (NToW).
