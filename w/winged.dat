5|$|Some {{events have}} bonus stages that add to a player's score, {{even if it}} has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a <b>winged</b> man across a series of trampolines, and flying another <b>winged</b> man as far as possible.|$|E

5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Devonian (400 million years ago) are all wingless, {{but by the}} Carboniferous (320 million years ago), more than 10 {{different}} genera of insects had fully functional wings. There is little preservation of transitional forms between the two periods. The earliest <b>winged</b> insects are from this time period (Pterygota), including the Blattoptera, Caloneurodea, primitive stem-group Ephemeropterans, Orthoptera and Palaeodictyopteroidea. Very early Blattopterans (during the Carboniferous) had a very large discoid pronotum and coriaceous forewings with a distinct CuP vein (an unbranched wing vein, lying near the claval fold and reaching the wing posterior margin). Even though the oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 396–407 million years old, it possessed dicondylic mandibles, a feature associated with <b>winged</b> insects.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses {{operates}} a dedicated limited stop service, route 100, to Edinburgh Airport from Waverley Bridge along Corstorphine Road. This service uses a dedicated fleet, special fares {{and its own}} web-site. An orange <b>winged</b> 'A' logo adorns the web site and the interior/exterior of the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Burney Relief (also {{known as}} the Queen of the Night relief) is a Mesopotamian {{terracotta}} plaque in high relief of the Isin-Larsa- or Old-Babylonian period, depicting a <b>winged,</b> nude, goddess-like figure with bird's talons, flanked by owls, and perched upon two lions.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Dwarfs made rare {{appearances}} in shorts, despite their popularity; they simply were {{too numerous to}} animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade (1939), The Seven Wise Dwarfs (1941, using mostly recycled footage), All Together (1942) and The <b>Winged</b> Scourge (1943) all include appearances.|$|E
5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a <b>winged</b> stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting {{one or two days}} but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a <b>winged</b> form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|While the {{military}} is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of <b>winged,</b> insect-like, nano-machines that self-replicate as they consume everything in their path. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.|$|E
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of <b>winged</b> earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} <b>winged</b> seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Batik {{making in}} the island of Bali is {{relatively}} new, but a fast-growing industry. Many patterns are inspired by local designs, which are favoured by the local Balinese and domestic tourists. Objects from nature such as frangipani and hibiscus flowers, birds or fishes, and daily activities such as Balinese dancer and ngaben processions or religious and mythological creatures such as barong, kala and <b>winged</b> lion are common. Modern batik artists express themselves freely {{in a wide range}} of subjects.|$|E
5|$|Commonwealth's cavalry, {{including}} the <b>Winged</b> Hussars, significantly restricted Russian mobility, {{forcing them to}} stay in their trenches. In a series of fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E
5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a <b>winged</b> man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a <b>winged</b> man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|During the Third Republic (1870–1940) the Louvre {{acquired}} new pieces mainly via {{donations and}} gifts. The Société des Amis du Louvre donated the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture <b>Winged</b> Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau.|$|E
5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience. Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: The <b>Winged</b> Bull was associated with Tiphareth, The Goat-Foot God with Malkuth, and The Sea Priestess with Yesod.|$|E
5|$|In the {{alternative}} image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown {{with his hands}} free. There are also differences in {{the wording of the}} letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man to the left of Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a <b>winged</b> hourglass on the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One <b>Winged</b> Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Insects can {{be divided}} into two groups {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and <b>winged</b> insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two <b>winged</b> boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{adults are}} oblong-ovate, {{and the same}} size and build as P. hyoscyami, but not as broad, {{measuring}} between 2.8 and 3.6mm in length. They have a brassy-green head and thorax, shining reddish-brown elytra and brassy-green legs. The hind femora are brassy in colour but paler at the base, and the antennae are brick-red. The adults are fully <b>winged,</b> and are capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Specht's {{personal}} emblems adorning his aircraft {{included a}} design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a chevron (termed a <b>winged</b> pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries. His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross {{painted on the}} cowling after {{he was awarded the}} honour in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Dening Hall has Daoist murals {{painted on}} {{three of its}} walls. The western wall's mural, {{said to have been}} painted in the Tang Dynasty, {{measures}} 17 by 7 meters and features a local water deity with a <b>winged</b> being at the top. With similar dimensions to the western mural, the eastern mural portrays the Dragon King. The hall contains nine statues, all dating from a more recent period than the hall.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War. It contains {{the names of}} 402 men from the area who fell in the First World War. It consists of a <b>winged</b> allegorical figure of Victory holding an olive branch, which stands on an octagonal column. The memorial is a grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely <b>winged</b> or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by <b>winged</b> females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually <b>winged</b> forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe side of it has the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the <b>winged</b> and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view, holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws. The Ionian Islands formed part of the Venetian maritime trade route to the Orient.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels, {{so named}} {{due to their}} helter-skelter flight, are the 37 species in the genus Pterodroma and have {{traditionally}} included the two species in the genus Bulweria. The species vary from small to medium sizes, , and are long <b>winged</b> with short hooked bills. The genus Pterodroma is now split into four sub genera, and some species have been split out of the genus (see below).|$|E
5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research. <b>Winged</b> male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually <b>winged</b> breeding females. Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home jersey was white {{with black and}} red stripes. The original 'away' jersey was black, with white and red trim. Shoulder patches used a <b>winged</b> 'S' 'established MDCCCXCIV' (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo {{until the end of}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} insect flight remain obscure, since the {{earliest}} <b>winged</b> insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.|$|E
5|$|The university's most {{competitive}} programs include track and field, which claims world record holder and Olympic gold medalist Tom Courtney as an alumnus; sailing, which is headquartered at the Morris Yacht and Beach Club in City Island, Bronx; crew, which rows {{out of the}} Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse on the Harlem River and frequents the Henley Royal Regatta in the United Kingdom; and golf, which is affiliated with the <b>Winged</b> Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York.|$|E
