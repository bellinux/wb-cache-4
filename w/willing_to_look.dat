She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E
500|$|At the convention's {{final day}} on July 14, 1972, presidential nominee McGovern {{selected}} and announced Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri as his vice-presidential choice. Eagleton was unknown to many delegates {{and the choice}} seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations. Thus, there were delegates <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> elsewhere. Gravel was nominated by Bettye Fahrenkamp, the Democratic National Committeewoman from Alaska. He then seconded his own nomination, breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination. In any case he won 226 delegate votes, coming in third behind Eagleton and Frances [...] "Sissy" [...] Farenthold of Texas, in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates as well.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Akane were mixed. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator {{liked the way}} the first episode focused on Akane's first day {{as a police officer}} and her opinions of it. Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post said Akane's personality is typical of those in dramas; he called her a [...] "naive waif who gets over her head with her first case". Zoth said that in later episodes, he liked the relationship Akane established with Masaoka and Ginoza, which resulted in several interesting scenes. Zoth said he grew to care about Akane {{during the first half of}} the series in [...] "a somewhat ironically 'moe' way, as she's grown as a character". In a similar review, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said Akane's actions in the first episode [...] " [...] her up as the clear-eyed, albeit naïve, outsider of the story, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at things differently". David West from Neo noted how weak Akane's character was in early episodes due to how often Kogami did her work. Moreover, once Kogami was impressed by Akane when she requested to revive her traumatic experience to see Makishima's face, West still felt the character was underdeveloped in contrast to Kogami's comments about her growth.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the character and what she would be like if she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E

Kimishima stated that this price point range was a subject of importance in designing the Switch's online services, and that regardless of what competitors were doing, [...] "it's a matter of getting our content to the consumer at a price point that will make them happy, and then we're <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what else we can do going forward."

2500|$|Robert A. Yelle {{is highly}} {{critical}} of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, [...] "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It {{is the work of}} a polemicist," [...] who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of [...] "dharmic traditions." [...] According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism. Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term [...] "dharmic traditions". According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga. Yelle ends his review with the remark {{that there has been a}} gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in the mirror, and be open to self-criticism.|$|E

Our willowy girls are afraid of nothing so much as growing stout; and if a young lady begins to round into proportions like the women in Titian's and Giorgione's pictures, she is distressed above measure, and begins to make secret inquiries into reducing diet, and to cling desperately to the strongest corset-lacing as her only hope. It would require one to be better educated than most of our girls are, to be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like the Sistine Madonna or the Venus of Milo.|$|E

He sent Tommy to Ballingall's, and accepted Miss Ailie's offer for Elspeth, but this was an impossible arrangement, for it was known to the two persons primarily concerned that Elspeth would die if she was not where Tommy was. The few boys he {{had already begun to}} know were at Cathro's or Ballingall's, and as they called Miss Ailie's a lassie school he had no desire to attend it, but where he was there also must Elspeth be. Daily he escaped from Ballingall's and hid near the Dovecot, as Miss Ailie's house was called, and every little while he gave vent to Shovel's whistle, so that Elspeth might know of his proximity and be cheered. Thrice was he carried back, kicking, to Ballingall's by urchins sent in pursuit, stern ministers of justice on the first two occasions; but on the third they made him an offer: if he would hide in Couthie's hen-house they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for him everywhere else for two hours.|$|E
60|$|The {{action was}} {{strategically}} well conceived; all that Lord Roberts {{could do for}} complete success had been done; but tactically it was a poor affair, considering his enormous preponderance in men and guns. There was no glory in it, save for the four regiments who set their faces against that sleet of lead. The artillery did not do well, and were browbeaten by guns which they should have smothered under their fire. The cavalry cannot {{be said to have}} done well either. And yet, when all is said, the action is an important one, for the enemy were badly shaken by the result. The Johannesburg Police, who had been among their corps d'elite, had been badly mauled, and the burghers were impressed by one more example of the impossibility of standing in anything approaching to open country against disciplined troops, Roberts had not captured the guns, but the road had been cleared for him to Bloemfontein and, what is more singular, to Pretoria; for though hundreds of miles intervene between the field of Driefontein and the Transvaal capital, he never again met a force which was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> his infantry in the eyes in a pitched battle. Surprises and skirmishes were many, but it was the last time, save only at Doornkop, that a chosen position was ever held for an effective rifle fire--to say nothing of the push of bayonet.|$|E
60|$|When awake [Endnote: 1], or {{beginning}} to awake, he lay {{for some time}} in a maze; not a disagreeable one, but thoughts were running to and fro in his mind, all mixed and jumbled together. Reminiscences of early days, even those that were Preadamite; referring, we mean, to those times in the almshouse, which he could not at ordinary times remember at all; but now {{there seemed to be}} visions of old women and men, and pallid girls, and little dirty boys, which could only be referred to that epoch. Also, and most vividly, there was the old Doctor, with his sternness, his fierceness, his mystery; and all that happened since, playing phantasmagoria before his yet unclosed eyes; nor, so mysterious was his state, did he know, when he should unclose those lids, where he should find himself. He was content to let the world go on in this way, as long as it would, and therefore did not hurry, but rather kept back the proofs of awakening; <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the scenes that were unrolling for his amusement, as it seemed; and willing, too, to keep it uncertain whether he were not back in America, and in his boyhood, and all other subsequent impressions a dream or a prophetic vision.
