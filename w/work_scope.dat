2500|$|Over {{the course}} of any {{construction}} project, the <b>work</b> <b>scope</b> may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industries maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.|$|E

40|$|Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer {{valuable}} {{measures to}} cope with todays attacks on computers and networks. But the increasing performance of networks and end systems and the growing complexity of IT systems lead to rapidly growing volumes of observation data and large signature bases. Therefore, IDS are forced to drop observations in high load situations offering chances to attackers to act undetectable. We introduce an efficient dynamically adaptable, distributed approach for a multi-step signature based IDS. Finally, we discuss initial performance evaluations of a prototype implementation and motivate future <b>work</b> <b>scopes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Many {{locations}} {{still use}} heat-sensitive tickets (and TRA's tourist branches still use Edmondsons), requiring one ticket examiner per fare control. Examiners punch and collect non-magnetic tickets, provide customer information and assistance, troubleshoot AFC malfunctions (e.g. mutilated tickets), and return cancelled (stamped) tickets to passengers requiring proof-of-travel for expense claims. TRA volunteers (with yellow vest) staff some gates. Volunteers, like America's auxiliary police and volunteer firefighters, include carefully selected and specifically trained {{members of the}} public, and retired industry personnel. They assist passengers, sometimes exercising Japanese or English language skills, and report turnstile jumpers and AFC malfunctions to employees.
