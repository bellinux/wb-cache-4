25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down on the couch and resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen studied Renaissance {{polyphony}} closely, {{which accounts}} {{for some of the}} melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his Tre Motetter (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciacaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote [...] "The intervals, as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music... t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note." ...|$|E

500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is it that <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E

2500|$|American {{advocates of}} {{independence}} were commonly lampooned in Britain {{for what was}} termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, {{at the same time}} that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves.

2500|$|The {{nature of}} American {{democracy}} was also questioned. The sentiment {{was that the}} country lacked [...] " [...] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," [...] according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans {{in the early nineteenth}} century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. [...] "How is it that <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] asked Samuel Johnson in 1775. He famously stated that, [...] "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American".|$|E

He measured and weighed the earth and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught us the truth of how we were made [...] "slaves" [...] and how we are kept in slavery by the [...] "slave-masters children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment could not take place until <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> truth. ...|$|E
2500|$|When he recovers Mervyn, Corinna and Geain {{prepare to}} leave hurriedly {{as they have}} had a call to tell them that their car is under siege by the Daughters of Darkness. Corinna offers Jerome a final chance to leave all his {{equipment}} behind and come to live with her and Geain, because they still love him. As he rapidly packs a few items they exit for the car, but as Jerome is on the brink of leaving, he realises that Corinna's speech about loving him may be the solution to writing his musical piece about love. He quickly returns to the flat and replays parts of the speech, isolating and manipulating one phrase which is indeed [...] "the sound" [...] which he has been waiting four years to hear. He feeds the sound sample into his complex equipment, and for the last three minutes of the play <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> final piece as he creates it. While this takes place, he remains oblivious to the video screen on which the audience sees Mervyn, Corinna and Geain hammering at the door in a vain attempt to persuade him to come with them. Eventually they give up. Whether or not they escape the Daughters of Darkness is not seen, but they are replaced at the door by Rita who attempts to break it down, and then smashes the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Except where {{everyday}} use survives {{in some regions}} of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested {{by the use of}} thou has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn ritual occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as God, a skylark, Achilles, and even The Mighty Thor. In The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader addresses the Emperor with the words: [...] "What is thy bidding, my master?" [...] In Leonard Cohen's song [...] "Bird on the Wire", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying [...] "I will make it all up to thee." [...] The Kaiser Chiefs song [...] "I Predict a Riot" [...] is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song [...] "Upside Down" [...] (written by Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards) <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> lyric [...] "Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'." [...] These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; {{or in the case of}} [...] "Upside Down", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy.|$|E
