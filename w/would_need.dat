5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that they <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to relocate. The reduction {{in the base of}} around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, export driven {{countries}} {{with a large}} trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption.|$|E

5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. SM1 flew aboard Endeavour in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days.|$|E
5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that he <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared {{the winner of the}} match, and he <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Davidson {{played a}} large role in the Fourth Test Old Trafford. Victory would give Australia an {{unassailable}} 2–1 series lead and retention of the Ashes. A loss would mean that Australia <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to win the Fifth and final Test to prevent England from reclaiming them.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages the Parish {{church of}} Ystradyfodwg near {{the bank of}} the River Rhondda served the parishioners of the Rhondda Fawr, while the {{families}} of the Rhondda Fach attended Llanwynno church.

5|$|Following {{his arrival}} in the United States, Toulmin wrote letters back to England, giving {{potential}} immigrants information they <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to know for their journey; these letters {{were published in the}} local Monthly Magazine.

5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone boundary in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to be paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to be discarded. Finally, a business <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies {{tend to be the}} need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
