5|$|Over twenty skulls {{have been}} found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, {{elaborate}} bony crest atop its skull, which contained the elongate narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two-thirds <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae.|$|E

25|$|The social {{composition}} of Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was {{a burst of}} marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war {{and in the next}} few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honours and money benefits if they had a sufficient number of children—mothers could earn around 1,300 roubles for having their fourth child and earn up to 5,000 roubles for their 10th.|$|E
25|$|These rules use area scoring, {{and have}} a komi of 6.5. Black has one further point deducted {{in the event that}} White was the first player to pass in the game. This last feature is a {{compromise}} with Japanese and Korean rules in that it is similar, in terms of its strategic consequences, to territory scoring. Unlike the Chinese rules, this rule will generally impose a penalty for an additional move {{at the end of the}} game within one's territory. In particular, the result of the game may differ by up to a point from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been had both players played it out.|$|E
500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.|$|E

2500|$|Disc one of The Smile Sessions assembles the Smile album as it {{may have}} sounded in the 1960s while loosely {{following}} the template spelled by Brian Wilson's 2004 interpretation. Wilson himself made a few suggestions to the compilation's sequencing after it was presented {{to him by the}} compilers Mark Linett, Alan Boyd and Dennis Wolfe. Brian has stated that the exact running order was not decided in 1967 and that the original Smile would have been [...] "less uplifting" [...] than his 2004 version. Although the track listing to The Smile Sessions is different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been on the original 1967 Smile album, interviews with Linett clarified that the track listing of the first disc would [...] "present the whole piece as close to it as was envisioned, or as is envisioned, as possible ... with input from Brian as from everybody else".|$|E
2500|$|While a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe) {{covered a}} large swath of {{territory}} relatively {{close to the}} epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and Watsonville) further to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (Violent). At more than [...] distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26g, {{and close to the}} epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6g. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist Bruce Bolt) extended about [...] in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been had it ruptured in one direction only.

[...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave."

2500|$|Opponents offer a Nathan Associates study {{commissioned}} by the National Retail Federation in 2000 that found a national sales tax bill filed by Billy Tauzin (Individual Tax Freedom Act) would bring a 3 year decline in the economy, a 4 year decline in employment and an 8 year decline in consumer spending. [...] Proponents {{point out that the}} FairTax has different features than the Tauzin bill and that the study done by the NRF makes many adverse assumptions and {{does not take into account}} the removal of embedded tax costs or the inventory credit that refunds 23% of the cost of held inventory. [...] The study, which represents supporters' worst-case scenario for a consumption tax, predicts that the economy will grow only 3% more in ten years than it would have under the income tax and that the increase in consumption will be 1.15% less in the first year relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been under the income tax. The study concludes that consumption will be higher in the fourth year and every year thereafter than it would have been under the income tax. [...] Research in 2006 on the FairTax plan by Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics shows that consumption would increase by 2.4% in the first year of the FairTax. The increase in consumption would be fueled by the 1.7% increase in disposable (after-tax) personal income. By the 10th year, consumption would increase by 11.7% over the current tax system; and disposable income would be up by 11.8%.|$|E
