50|$|The Warm Air Research House is a {{historic}} house and research facility located at 1108 W. Stoughton St. in Urbana, Illinois. Built in 1924, the house served as a warm-air heating research facility administered jointly by the National Warm-Air Heating and Ventilating Association and the University of Illinois Department of Mechanical Engineering. Prior to the 1920s, the American heating industry had few formal testing procedures for their products, and home heating through <b>warm-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducts was still considered a novel concept. The National Warm-Air Heating and Ventilating Association began to test heating methods and systems in the Department of Mechanical Engineering's laboratories, but it eventually needed a model house in which to test its domestic heating systems. The two organizations commissioned the large Colonial Revival residence, which was designed by architect Loring Harvey Provine and graduate student Clarence Andrew Kissinger. Beginning in 1932, research on air conditioning and cooling systems was also conducted in the house. Following World War II, the facility became less useful due to the shrinking size of new American homes, and the university sold the house in 1946. Some of the technologies developed in the house include storm windows, forced-air heating, and heating duct size and positioning.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} <b>warm-air</b> heating and <b>ventilation</b> system of energyefficient family house. The part of thesis is {{theoretical}} introduction to low-energy and passive houses, ventilation and heating. The proposal itself {{is based on}} the applicable standards and includes all progressive steps, including the calculation of the thermal performance and sizing individual parts of the system.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} energy {{simulation}} of a heat recovery system in coupling with a ground heat exchanger (GHE) in a low-energy family house with <b>warm-air</b> heating and <b>ventilation.</b> The effect of GHE on operation {{and effectiveness of}} a heat recovery unit was assessed {{from the results of}} the simulation. Next, energy and economic benefits of the heat recovery with and without GHE and consequent savings were evaluated as well. The profitability of the investment was assessed using comparison with the investment costs. Recommendations for the operation of the system were suggested...|$|R
