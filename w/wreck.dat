5|$|After Pete George's {{retirement}} in 1987, the upkeep of the <b>Wreck</b> fell directly upon {{the shoulders of}} the <b>Wreck</b> Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, the <b>Wreck</b> has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages. The <b>Wreck</b> has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.|$|E
5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the <b>Wreck</b> was found in 1961, the Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive the <b>Wreck</b> for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to drive the Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the <b>Wreck</b> as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The <b>Wreck</b> was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the <b>Wreck,</b> upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E

5|$|The Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> {{has been}} {{featured}} in several newspapers, magazines, and books. The Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> is portrayed leading the Georgia Tech football team onto the field {{on the cover of}} Al Thomy's 1973 work Ramblin' <b>Wreck</b> – A Story of Georgia Tech Football.

The main islands {{of this group}} are Middle Island, Square Island, Long Island, Pelsaert Island, Basile Island and the Mangrove Group. A great many ships have been <b>wrecked</b> in the Pelsaert Group, most notably the Zeewijk, which was <b>wrecked</b> on the Half Moon Reef in 1727, the {{survivors}} staying on Gun Island for some time afterwards. Other <b>wrecks</b> include the Ocean Queen, <b>wrecked</b> on the Half Moon Reef in 1842; the Ben Ledi, <b>wrecked</b> off Pelsaert Island in 1879; and the Windsor, <b>wrecked</b> on the Half Moon Reef in 1908.|$|R

50|$|Thunderball {{possesses}} a virtually indestructible <b>wrecking</b> ball {{attached to a}} 4 ft chain, enchanted by the Wrecker's power. The <b>wrecking</b> ball, when thrown, is capable of returning to Thunderball {{in a similar fashion}} as Wrecker's crowbar and Thor's hammer. With effort, Thunderball can even control the path it takes on its return. Thunderball can spin the <b>wrecking</b> ball on its chain fast enough to deflect bullets and automatic gunfire. By slamming the <b>wrecking</b> ball on the ground, Thunderball can cause minor localized quakes, knocking his opponents off-balance. The <b>wrecking</b> ball is also durable enough to be thrown into vehicles, buildings, and other structures, knocking them down with no damage to itself. In the past, the Hulk and Hercules have both destroyed the <b>wrecking</b> ball. When this happens, Thunderball doesn't suffer any ill psychic effects from the <b>wrecking</b> ball's destruction. He can recreate the weapon by obtaining a new <b>wrecking</b> ball and having the Wrecker enchant it for him.|$|R

The modern <b>Wreck</b> has donned {{a number of different}} paint jobs and has had several restorations and modifications made to it. These changes were made by various individuals and organizations over the years, including Bobby Dodd and Georgia Tech Alumni Pete George, who worked at the Ford plant in Hapeville, Georgia.
