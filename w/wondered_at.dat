5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> his presence.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, the Citigroup Center was an {{engineering}} challenge. When {{planning for the}} skyscraper {{began in the early}} 1970s, the northwest corner of the proposed building site was occupied by St. Peter's Lutheran Church. The church allowed Citicorp to demolish the old church and build the skyscraper under one condition: a new church would have to be built on the same corner, with no connection to the Citicorp building and no columns passing through it, because the church wanted to remain {{on the site of the}} new development, near one of the intersections. Architects <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> the time if this demand was too much and would make the proposal unfeasible.|$|E
25|$|The Gurjar Pratihar Empire {{acted as}} a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century. The chief {{accomplishment}} of the Gurjara Pratihara empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west, starting {{in the days of}} Junaid. Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance {{in other parts of the}} world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly 300 years.|$|E

500|$|Traveling by {{steamboat}} up the York River, the 29th {{arrived at}} White House Landing and {{marched to the}} battle front on June 8, 1862. [...] The regiment {{was attached to the}} Irish Brigade (2nd Brigade, 1st Division, II Corps). [...] Contemporaries and historians alike have <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> this unusual assignment. [...] The 29th Massachusetts was made up of men descended, largely, from old-stock English families, some with heritage dating back to the Mayflower. [...] There was, at the time, significant social friction in New England between established Protestant families and Irish immigrants. [...] While the regimental historian observed that the 29th was [...] "cordially welcomed" [...] to the Irish Brigade, other historians, such as Marion Armstrong, point out the oddity of the [...] "aristocratic 29th Massachusetts ... thrown in with three regiments of New York Irishmen." [...] Historian Daniel Callaghan quotes period sources describing the [...] "unlikely matching of ancient political foes," [...] {{and the manner in which}} the men of the 29th tolerated the Irish-born commander of the Irish Brigade, Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher, [...] "coldly, in a pinched and critical silence." ...|$|E

500|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 950 feet long, {{was released}} on July 22, 1910. The film had known showings in Indiana, and Maryland. The film was advertised, possibly in error, as simply Playwright's Love and A Playwright's Love. The film received numerous reviews in the trade publications and most were positive. The Moving Picture News review was positive and stated, [...] "Love knows neither creed nor class, and when the unsuccessful playwright {{falls in love with}} the daughter of a woman whom he had taken a charitable interest in {{at the time of her}} death, the fact is not to be <b>wondered</b> <b>at.</b> He plays a noble part and is rewarded as the film reaches it final scene. The story is rich in feeling and sympathy, the settings are touching and appropriate and the photography is pretty good." [...] Another review in the publication agreed that the film was another high-quality Thanhouser release. The Moving Picture World spared only a brief summary of the film with a simple approval for the romantic story. The New York Dramatic Mirror found another reason that the film was worth seeing - the absence of a villain.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 17, 1911. The film was met {{with a wide variety}} of reviews by critics; with the majority proving to be negative. The Morning Telegraph, like others, found the story to be foolish and completely improbable on many accounts. While the reviewer stated that no magistrate would have sent the man to jail for assault with a blunt knife, it was the jail substitution via a changing of clothes which proved to be impossible. H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News found the baron to be boorish by shading a lady's hand with a glove on and <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> how Thanhouser was able to film the prison scenes. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News summed up the film and stated, [...] "Good teaching as to woman's 'class', but as to details sadly lax." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror panned the film beginning with, [...] "Nothing more improbable or inconsistent has been seen on the screen in some time..." [...] The reviewer concluded the review of the improbable plot as to having been [...] "dreamed up by a ten-year-old girl." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a year at}} RADA, Morrissey {{went back}} to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse. He then did Le Cid and Twelfth Night with Cheek by Jowl, and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with {{director}} Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in King John in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had often <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> RADA if he would ever {{have the chance to}} act in classical theatre. His performance has been described as [...] "the most contentious characterisation of the production"; he received negative critical reaction from Daily Telegraph and Independent critics, but a positive opinion from the Financial Times. In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, [...] "The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking." [...] Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in Peer Gynt (1990). Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance. During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.|$|E

500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who {{yelled at}} the others when escaping", calling it [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was able}} to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He wondered how the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise. Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "jazzy, uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing", and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010, [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside". While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but she <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't do too much for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed to drag {{on and on and on}} with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics.com {{repeated}} many of {{the same}} sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by [...] "insipid dialog" [...] amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other [...] "dude." [...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance." [...] He also <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen." [...] Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality.|$|E
