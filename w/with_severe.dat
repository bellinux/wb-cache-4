5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children <b>with</b> <b>severe</b> P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children <b>with</b> <b>severe</b> malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E

5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those <b>with</b> <b>severe</b> disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those <b>with</b> <b>severe</b> symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
