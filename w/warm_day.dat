25|$|The last ever rugby league Grand Final {{played at}} the Cricket Ground was the 1987 decider between the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Canberra Raiders, who had joined the premiership in 1982. In front of 50,201 fans on an unseasonably <b>warm</b> <b>day</b> in Sydney, the Sea Eagles ran out 18–8 winners, scoring two tries to one with dual rugby {{international}} Michael O'Connor scoring 14 of Manly's points with a try and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Manly's other try scorer that day, Five-eighth Cliff Lyons won the Clive Churchill Medal as {{the man of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30a.m. on Thursday 11 April, Titanic {{arrived at}} Cork Harbour {{on the south}} coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but {{relatively}} <b>warm</b> <b>day,</b> with a brisk wind. Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of Titanics size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded Titanic at Queenstown, 3 First Class, 7 Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Father Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee, who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard Titanic, including the last-ever known photograph of the ship. A decidedly unofficial departure {{was that of a}} crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore. Titanic weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30p.m. and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{literature}} regarding {{clinical outcomes}} following day 5 / 6 vitrified warmed blastocysts transfer has been conflicting. We decided {{to evaluate and}} compare the clinical outcomes following vitrified <b>warmed</b> <b>day</b> 5 / 6 blastocyst transfer using a solid surface vitrification protocol with fresh blastocyst transfers. Settings: University teaching hospital. Study Design: A total of 249 women were retrospectively analyzed: 146 fresh day 5 blastocyst (group 1), 57 <b>day</b> 5 vitrified <b>warmed</b> blastocyst (group 2), and 46 vitrified <b>warmed</b> <b>day</b> 6 blastocyst (group 3) transfer cycles. Vitrification was done using solid surface methodology (non immersion protocol). The main outcomes were implantation rates, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rate per embryo transfer. Results: The baseline clinical characteristics were similar among all three groups. The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates following vitrified <b>warmed</b> <b>day</b> 6 blastocyst transfers (20. 9 % and 32. 6 %) were significantly lower as compared to day 5 fresh and vitrified <b>warmed</b> <b>day</b> 5 blastocyst transfers (40. 3 % and 56. 1 %, 36. 3 %, and 52. 6 %). However, {{there was no significant}} difference in the live birth rates across the three groups (group 1 : 37. 6 %, group 2 : 40. 3 %, and group 3 : 28. 2 %). Conclusion: No statistically significant difference was observed in live birth rates between fresh day 5 blastocyst transfers and vitrified <b>warmed</b> <b>day</b> 5 / 6 blastocyst transfers. Vitrification of blastocysts using solid surface methodology is an efficient method of cryopreservation...|$|R
