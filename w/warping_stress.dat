50|$|Bimoment (aka warping moment) is a {{term used}} in the {{analysis}} of beams (continuum mechanics), which relates to torsion and warping. Its symbol is Mω. Bimoment show the distributions at a cross-section of (longitudinal) <b>warping</b> <b>stress,</b> for the cases of torsional warping and distortional warping respectively. Generally, a bimoment can be represented by a pair of equal and opposite bending moments.|$|E
50|$|In actual {{structural}} systems, the shear walls may {{function as}} a coupled system instead of isolated walls depending on their arrangements and connections. Two neighboring wall panels can be considered coupled when the interface transfers longitudinal shear to resist the deformation mode. This stress arises whenever a section experiences a flexural or restrained <b>warping</b> <b>stress</b> and its magnitude {{is dependent on the}} stiffness of the coupling element. Depending on this stiffness, the performance of a coupled section will fall between that of an ideal uniform element of similar gross plan cross-section and the combined performance of the independent component parts. Another advantage of coupling is that it enhances the overall flexural stiffness dis-proportionally to shear stiffness, resulting in smaller shear deformation.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} design of steel beams considers that any deformation {{of a member}} due to applied load must {{be a combination of}} the four rigid body modes (axial deformation, major axis bending, minor axis bending and twisting) i. e. the member retains its cross sectional shape without distortion. In a hot rolled member the <b>warping</b> <b>stresses</b> which arise due to violation of the assumption that plane sections remain plane can often be neglected. In thin walled sections, however, these <b>warping</b> <b>stresses</b> are typically of the same order of magnitude as the primary bending stresses induced in the member by the applied loading and therefore cannot be neglected. In addition, if plane sections do not remain plane, the cross section distorts when a load is applied. The first part of this Thesis presents a method of analysis for any open unbranched thin walled section which considers both rigid body movement and cross section distortion (including local buckling). The method is such that the four rigid body modes are automatically identified and separated from the remaining cross section distortion modes. The second part of this Thesis develops a finite difference method of analysis, in conjunction with the theory of part I, to consider the behaviour of a member subject to any arbitrary loading condition and end restraint. Both first order linear problems and second order elastic critical buckling problems are solved, including the interaction of local buckling, overall buckling and cross section distortion...|$|R
40|$|A {{concrete}} pavement fatigue design procedure {{accounting for the}} stress range induced by the applied loads is proposed. As {{a matter of fact}} the stress range, whose value is variable in time as temperature and traffic stresses in the pavement vary, affects the concrete fatigue strength, and laboratory fatigue laws accounting for such a parameter have been defined. The Tepfers's fatigue law has been checked and corrected according, to the experimental results of the AASHO Road Test. The structural analysis of several concrete AASHO sections has been performed superimposing the seasonal and daily variations of the <b>warping</b> <b>stresses</b> with the traffic induced stresses and imposing that the cumulative damage up to failure induced by the effective number of repetitions associated to each resultant stress condition satisfies the Miner's law. A corrected design fatigue law is therefore proposed and some practical design suggestions are developped based on the analysis of the influence of the stress range...|$|R

One {{of the main}} lateral load resistant systems is core wall system in high-rise buildings. Core wall system has two important behavioral aspects where the first aspect is related to reduce the lateral displacement by the core bending resistance {{and the second is}} governed by increasing of the torsional resistance and core warping of buildings. In this study, the effects of closed section core in the last story have been considered on the behavior of models. Regarding this, all analyses were performed by ETABS 9.2.v software (Wilson and Habibullah). Considering (a) drift and rotation of the core over height of buildings, (b) total and <b>warping</b> <b>stress</b> in the core body, (c) shear in beams due to <b>warping</b> <b>stress,</b> (d) effect of closing last story on period of models in various modes, (e) relative displacement between walls in the core system and (f) site effects in far and near field of fault by UBC 97 spectra on base shear coefficient showed that the bimoment in open core is negative {{in the last quarter of}} building and it is similar to wall–frame structures. Furthermore, analytical results revealed that closed section core in the last story improves behavior of the last quarter of structure height, since closing of core section in the last story does not have significant effect on reducing base shear value in near and far field of active faults.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} evaluation of <b>warping</b> shear <b>stresses</b> of bars of an arbitrary doubly symmetric constant cross section undergoing nonuniform torsional vibrations taking into account the effect of geometrical nonlinearity. The bar is Subjected to arbitrarily distributed or concentrated conservative dynamic twisting and warping moments along its length, while its edges are supported by the most general torsional and axial boundary conditions. The transverse displacement components are expressed so as to be valid for large twisting rotations (finite displacement - small strain theory), thus the arising governing differential equations and boundary conditions are in general nonlinear. Employing a variational approach, a coupled nonlinear initial boundary value problem with respect to the main unknown kinematical components and two boundary Value problems with respect to the primary and secondary warping functions are formulated. The solution of the last two problems is performed by a pore BEM approach requiring exclusively boundary discretization of the bar's cross section and leading to the evaluation of the <b>warping</b> shear <b>stresses.</b> The arising linear system of equations related to the secondary warping function is singular and a special technique is used to perform its regularization. The validity of the negligible axial inertia assumption is examined for the problem at hand. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Steel curved I-girder bridge {{systems may}} be more {{susceptible}} to instability during construction than bridges constructed of straight I-girders. The primary goal of this project is to study {{the behavior of the}} steel superstructure of curved steel Igirder bridge systems during all phases of construction, and to ascertain whether the linear elastic analysis software used by Mn/DOT during the design process represents well the actual stresses in the bridge. Sixty vibrating wire strain gages were applied to a two-span, four-girder bridge, and the resulting stresses and deflections were compared to computational results for the full construction sequence of the bridge. The computational results from the Mn/DOT analysis software were first shown to compare well with results from a program developed specifically for this project (called the "UM program"), since the latter permits more detailed specification of actual loading conditions on the bridge during construction. The UM program, in turn, correlated well with the field measurements, especially for the primary flexural <b>stresses.</b> <b>Warping</b> <b>stresses</b> induced in the girders, and the stresses in the crossframes, were more erratic, but showed reasonable correlation. It is concluded that Mn/DOT's analysis software captures the behavior well for these types of curved girder bridge systems, and that the stresses in these bridges may be relatively low if their design is controlled largely by stiffness.

40|$|It’s {{well known}} that {{thin-walled}} elastic theory represents an important simplified model to analyze various actual structures. Particularly, this model can be applied with good results {{to the analysis of}} ships with large deck openings, subjected to non-uniform torsion, whose distinctive feature is that they may undergo considerable warping deformations. In this paper the problem of the elastic equilibrium of a thin-walled beam is discussed from the beginning, assuming the fundamental hypothesis of Kollbrunner and Hajdin, 1972, {{based on the assumption that}} the longitudinal distribution of the warping deformations is an arbitrary function independent of the unit twist angle. Furthermore the effective longitudinal distribution of the applied torque is taken into due consideration to determine the longitudinal distribution of the warping function and the unit twist angle, in the hypothesis of restrained torsion. It is {{well known that}} a still unsolved problem is the role of transverse bulkheads, generally assumed as perfectly rigid in the evaluation of the bimoment longitudinal distribution. So a method, based on a global energy approach, is presented to take into account the deformability of transverse bulkheads, schematized as orthotropic plates. Finally, a numerical application to a ship with large deck openings is carried out, in order to evaluate the viability of the proposed method. A numerical comparison with the classical Vlasov theory is carried out, in order to highlight the role of the transverse bulkheads in the evaluation of <b>warping</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} performance {{together with}} the theoretical predictions of strains and deflections of thin fibre cement corrugated sheets are principally reported in this thesis. Existing theories of tensile behaviour of fibre reinforced cement are reviewed. Asbestos cement and alternative fibre reinforced cement technologies associated with these sheeting materials are discussed. Asbestos cement and polypropylene network reinforced cement corrugated sheeting have been tested {{under a variety of}} loading regimes and support conditions. Asbestos-free commercial products have also been tested. Finite element analyses based on the LUSAS system have been used to predict the shape of the uncracked load- deflection curves and deflection and strain profiles of various corrugated sheets with different geometrical profiles. Wetting and drying tests on uncracked asbestos cement and polypropylene network reinforced cement sheets have been carried out and a prediction made using the Lusas program of the <b>warping</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by moisture gradients. A new approach has been developed to predict the load-deflection curves and deflection profiles of semi-cracked and severely cracked polypropylene network reinforced cement sheets under various loading regimes. In this approach, cyclic loading characteristics of the tensile specimens were used to estimate the elastic moduli of the cracked composite for various numbers of cracks at two different load levels. Generally, the theoretical predictions show good agreement with the experimental results for uncracked and cracked sheets and hence the mathematical models could, with confidence, be used to assess the performance of a range of corrugated sheeting with various loading configurations...|$|R

Therefore, the fatigue loads have to be computed by a direct calculation method. In order to estimate ship’s fatigue damage due to the horizontal bending and torsion, depending on the complexity of computation methods, it might be very time consuming to compute ship structural stresses for all possible sea conditions. Through the comparison of different hydrodynamic and structural analysis methods with the full-scale measurements of two different sizes of containerships, this paper is targeted to study how much fatigue damages are caused by the vertical bending, horizontal bending induced stress, in particular the contribution from <b>warping</b> <b>stress</b> from different structural details in containerships.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} assessing fatigue damage of ship structures assumes moderate wave amplitudes and linear responses. This method can be questioned when applied on container ships which {{are characterized by}} large deck openings that cause low torsion rigidity of the structure. Depending on the heading of the vessel in relation to wave encounter direction, container ships can therefore be sensitive to, for example, oblique waves. In the current investigation, the SESAM software with the three-dimensional hydrodynamic code WASIM is used to simulate a 4400 TEU container ship operating in the North Atlantic.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} early-life behaviour of concrete industrial ground floors. Advances in construction methods are placing increased demands on the performance of industrial floors and pushing the limits of the current design guidance. Uncertainties about the true behaviour of industrial floors have been addressed by a programme of in-situ monitoring. An in-situ instrumentation methodology has been developed to monitor the slab and the local climate. Vibrating wire strain gauges and demecs were used to collect concrete shrinkage and joint performance data, whilst thermocouple arrays and thermistors in the strain gauges recorded the slab temperature. This allowed the effects of the cement hydration and the impact of ambient conditions on the slab to be assessed. The use of an automated data collection system allowed the timing as well as the magnitude of the movements to be measured helping identify cause and effect. Floor slabs covering long strip and large area pour construction, jointed and jointless detailing and mesh fabric and fibre reinforcement have been investigated. The data has shown the strong thermal influence on the behaviour of the slabs. Initial joint opening was found to be triggered by the cooling of the slab, whilst the effects of seasonal temperature changes in the first couple of months after construction could be as large if not larger than the drying shrinkage. Frictional resistance was found to reduce the measured movement, whilst the restraint arising from adjacent pours was also found to be significant. Finite element models of the temperature development have been produced using material property data found in the literature. Calibration and verification were carried out using the temperature data collected from site with good agreement. Structural models were then developed using the temperature and degree of hydration output from the thermal analysis as input. These models were used to determine the theoretical stress distribution in slabs at early-ages, and to conduct a parametric study. This demonstrated that the <b>warping</b> <b>stresses</b> present in a slab are generally greater than those from frictional restraint. The thesis concludes with recommendations for the design and construction of industrial ground floors...|$|R
