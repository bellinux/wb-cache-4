25|$|The Railway, {{widely known}} as The Gare Saint-Lazare, was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban {{landscape}} of Paris {{in the late}} 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, Victorine Meurent, also the model for Olympia and the Luncheon on the Grass, sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> painter, watching a train pass beneath them.|$|E
25|$|Next {{come the}} gods of the heaven. Eos, goddess of the dawn, rides sidesaddle into battle. She pulls back her horse and is armed with a torch which she thrusts forward. She is {{followed}} by Helios, who rises up from the ocean with his quadriga and enters the battle armed with a torch. His target is a Giant standing in his way. He has rolled over another Giant. Theia follows, amidst her children. She {{is the mother of}} the day and night stars. Next to her mother and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewer, the moon goddess Selene rides on her mule over a Giant.|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Express" [...] and Burlesque, Aguilera has {{performed}} the track on two shows. Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap her fingers and leaned into the [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

60|$|There was a short, uncomfortable silence. Lady Ruth rose to {{her feet}} and stood facing the {{fireplace}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R

It was followed by [...] "Part 6: Power & Control" [...] on 30 May, where Diamandis is seen engaging in a series of mind games with her romantic interest. Diamandis alleged that Atlantic Records delayed the premiere of [...] "Part 7: How to Be a Heartbreaker" [...] because they felt she was [...] "ugly" [...] in the clip; it was made publicly available on 28 September, and sees Diamandis interacting with several shirtless men in a community shower. [...] "Part 8: E.V.O.L." [...] introduced the previously-unreleased track [...] "E.V.O.L" [...] on 14 February 2013.

500|$|Sia {{performed}} [...] "Chandelier" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on 19 May 2014, with Ziegler recreating the choreography in {{the music}} video. Sia also performed the song on Late Night with Seth Meyers on 9 June 2014, with Girls star Lena Dunham performing new choreography. In July 2014, Sia performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Ziegler taught host Jimmy Kimmel and his sidekick Guillermo some of the dance moves from the music video. In July 2014, Sia performed the song on the VH1's show [...] "SoundClash", along with her songs [...] "Elastic Heart" [...] and [...] "Big Girls Cry" [...] from the album. Sia sang the song on Dancing with the Stars, with Ziegler dancing a duet with Allison Holker, and at the 2014 We Can Survive Concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In February 2015, Sia sang the song in a cluttered apartment set for the 2015 Grammy Awards telecast. Ziegler danced in a cluttered apartment with actress Kristen Wiig. For all of these performances, Sia sang the track <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera. She performed the song on Saturday Night Live in January 2015, veiled, with a sad-looking mime who performed the lyrics in American sign language.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2014 {{the couple}} opened the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, {{performing}} the song live {{together for the}} first time. The performance opened with Beyoncé sporting wet-look hair in a leotard and a leather basque, sitting on a chair <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience. She conctinued seductively dancing cabaret-style, singing and gyrating on the dark stage surrounded by smoke. Jay-Z appeared to rap his verses dressed in a suit and bow tie. The sexually-charged performance ended with a kiss and the two walked off with their arms around each other. Beyoncé's chair dance received comparisons with scenes from the movie Flashdance, the song's music video and the video for [...] "Partition"; VH1's Emily Exton felt {{that it was one of}} the best chair dances of all time. The duet was described as [...] "scorching" [...] and [...] "chill inducing" [...] with many critics considering the performance to be a show highlight; Lily Harrison of E! added that the pair [...] "set the bar impossibly high". A Rolling Stone editor felt it was [...] "near flawless". Nadeska Alexis writing for MTV News noted that when the singer started singing the first verses of the song, [...] "you could almost taste the aroma of sex appeal in the air". A negative review came from Beverly Beckham of The Boston Globe who felt that the pair failed to showcase love in the lyrics and performance.|$|E

500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.|$|E

60|$|She seated herself <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him. Dignity demanded reprisals, so he seated {{himself with}} his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her; and the futile ocean raged towards them, and the wind grew chillier every minute.|$|R
6000|$|When she returned, {{the girl}} stood looking dreamily {{out of the}} little crooked panes of the low window. She asked, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother, [...] "What would you do, if I went?" ...|$|R
