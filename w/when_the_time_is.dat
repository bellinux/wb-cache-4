Activision's Guitar Hero series sold more than 25 million units with over $2 billion in retail revenue, while Harmonix's Rock Band series has sold over 13 million copies; both series were augmented with a large volume of downloadable content. However, due to {{saturation of the market}} in 2009 along with the economic recess, both series have since ceased publishing, though Harmonix has stated they will bring back Rock Band to the eighth-generation <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> right.|$|E

He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.
