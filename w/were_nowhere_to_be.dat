25|$|Both {{director}} McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds {{during the}} film. Schwarzenegger's weight loss {{was a professional}} choice. McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of {{the cast and crew}} suffered from traveler's diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00a.m. to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E
25|$|Fitzpatrick rode to Benalla {{where he}} {{reported}} that he had been attacked by Kelly as well as his brother Dan, his mother, a neighbour Bricky Williamson and Kelly's brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick claimed that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers and that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. Williamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, but Ellen was taken into custody along with her baby, Alice. Mrs Kelly, Skillian, and Williamson were tried and convicted of attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. When Kelly was executed his mother was still in prison.|$|E
25|$|The KLA {{seized the}} mine on 22 June, taking nine Serb mineworkers hostage, {{converting}} the mine into {{a base of}} operations and taunting the Yugoslav authorities by sending daylight patrols {{within sight of the}} provincial capital, Pristina. Over the next seven days, Yugoslav authorities and the KLA negotiated over the fate of the mineworkers. Once negotiations broke down, the VJ and MUP attacked the mine and forced the KLA out. Ten militants were killed in the clashes. The VJ and MUP reported suffering no casualties. Though the mine was recaptured, the hostages <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, and it is assumed they were killed by the militants. As of June 2014, the location of the mineworkers' remains is unknown. No one has ever been convicted of their deaths.|$|E

500|$|While {{retiring}} with Irresistibles survivors aboard, Ocean herself {{struck a}} drifting mine at around 19:00. Her starboard coal bunkers and passageways flooded, her steering jammed hard to port, {{and she took}} {{on a list of}} 15° to starboard. She came under fire from shore and began taking hits, which flooded her starboard engine room and prevented steering repairs. The destroyers , , and [...] came alongside and took off her crew (and the survivors from Irresistible) at around 19:30. She then drifted into Morto Bay, still under fire, and sank there unobserved by Allied forces at about 22:30. When destroyer Jed entered the bay later that evening to sink Ocean and Irresistible with torpedoes so that they could not be captured by the Turks, the two battleships <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{invasion}} {{occurred in}} 1281 when Mongols sent two separate forces: 900 ships containing 40,000 Korean, Chinese, and Mongol troops were sent from Masan, while {{a force of}} 100,000 sailed from southern China in 3,500 ships, each close to [...] long. The fleet was hastily assembled and ill-equipped to cope with maritime conditions. In November, they sailed into the treacherous waters that separate Korea and Japan by 110 miles. The Mongols easily took over Tsushima Island about halfway across the strait and then Iki Island closer to Kyushu. The Korean fleet reached Hakata Bay on June 23, 1281 and landed its troops and animals, but the ships from China <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E

2500|$|Although the bananas {{were present}} at Maine Road matches, the bigger {{inflatable}} displays were generally reserved for away matches, most notably against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. This was an evening match which City lost 1–0. The drab match itself {{has largely been}} forgotten apart from Brian Gayle's original excuse for the mistake which cost the goal: [...] "I was blinded by the floodlights". The sheer array of inflatables staggered many, four City fans appeared carrying an inflatable paddling pool, and sharks, penguins, crocodiles were present and there was even an epic battle of the monsters. At {{one end of the}} terrace stood Godzilla. Six feet tall, green and mean, this dinosaur was a match for anybody. At {{the other end of the}} terrace stood Frankenstein's Monster. Slowly they began to converge towards the centre of the terrace. The crowd roared in anticipation. Eventually they met and the creatures joined in battle. The craze soon died down and come the 1990s the inflatable displays on a large scale <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E
2500|$|Once the BCJHL playoffs rolled around, the Centennials <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. Opting {{to return}} to the Centennial Cup Junior [...] "A" [...] playoffs, the league decided that Merritt would {{represent}} them. While the rest of the BCJHL teams were partaking in the regular post-season, the Centennials first faced the PCJHL's Richmond Sockeyes for the Mowat Cup provincial championship. Merritt swept the best of five series 3–0 [...] and advanced to the BC/Alberta Junior [...] "A" [...] Championship against the Alberta Junior Hockey League's Calgary Canucks. The Centennials were too much for the Canucks to handle, and swept them aside in six games. Unfortunately for the Cents and their fans, the Cinderella run came to an end in the Abbott Cup Championship against the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League's Prince Albert Raiders. The Raiders beat the Centennials 4 games to 1, but the stunning playoff run and successful regular season firmly planted the team in the hearts of hockey fans throughout the Nicola Valley. The team's accomplishments didn't go unnoticed at the BCJHL's post-season awards either, as Tennant won coach of the year [...] and Polman-Tuin took home the goaltender of the year and best goaltending duo awards.|$|E
2500|$|Operations {{were mainly}} at altitudes {{of less than}} 600 meters {{primarily}} to attack any enemy aircraft flying to attack American ground forces. [...] During the closing days of the war, reports indicated that enemy activity had dwindled to a great extent. Only a few biplanes and an occasional enemy formation of aircraft were seen. [...] The last flight that involved combat with enemy aircraft took place on 8 November when Lieutenant Rhenstrom took off on a voluntary patrol to strafe enemy infantry on a road from Remeinville to Montmedy. [...] As {{he came out of}} the clouds he saw three enemy Fokkers slightly below him and going in the same direction. [...] He dove on the rear plane of the formation and saw the plane start to spin and fall immediately after his first burst. [...] he then turned to the second enemy aircraft and saw the tracer bullets enter its fuselage, [...] seeing it crash. [...] The third enemy plane turned and avoided combat. [...] He then continued, looking for the infantry, but they <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. [...] On his way back to Rembercourt Rhenstrom saw an enemy balloon in the region of Chauvency-le-Château which he attacked, however without results.|$|E

2500|$|Legend {{states that}} Hanina was greatly grieved at not being able, with other pious people, to present {{something}} to the Temple. In his despondency {{he walked out of}} town, and, seeing a huge rock, he vowed to carry it to Jerusalem as a gift to the Holy City. He smoothed and polished it, and then looked around for help to transport it. Five laborers appeared, and offered to carry the rock to its destined place for one hundred gold pieces. Hanina, who did not possess half that amount, turned away in despair. Soon, however, other laborers appeared and demanded only five [...] "sela'im," [...] but they stipulated that Hanina himself should aid in the transportation. The agreement concluded, they all seized the rock, and in an instant stood before Jerusalem. When Hanina turned to pay the laborers they <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found. He repaired to the Sanhedrin to inquire what disposition he should make of the uncollected wages. The Sanhedrin heard his tale and concluded that the laborers were ministering angels, not human laborers, and that Hanina was therefore at liberty to apply the money to his own use. He, however, presented it to the Temple (Cant. R. i. 1; Eccl. R. i.).|$|E
2500|$|The Germans in Triangle Farm {{held their}} ground until the 1/8th Warwick, {{covered by a}} tank (possibly G. 31), got inside and fought the {{garrison}} hand-to-hand. Tank G. 34 (Second-Lieutenant Coutts) headed for the Cockcroft, the most distant objective, [...] from St Julien, up the Zonnebeke–Langemarck road. It took until [...] to reach the fortification, the crew and the garrison exchanging machine-gun fire for about [...] when about fifty Germans emerged from the Cockcroft and dugouts nearby, only to be shot down by machine-gun fire from the tank. G. 34 ditched south of the Cockcroft soon after and the crew set up the Lewis guns in shell-holes nearby. As the 1/8th Warwick <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen, Coutts sent a messenger pigeon back with the news {{and two of the}} crew to find the troops. The 1/8th Warwick refused to advance until Coutts came back and found an officer to order sixty men forward, to dig in along the Lewis gun cordon. The crew remained until [...] then retired after putting a guard of three rifle-bombers in the tank and camouflaging it. At the other fortified farms and strongpoints, merely the arrival of tanks induced the garrisons to run and the British were able to establish their own line of outposts up {{the west side of the}} St Julien–Poelcappelle road, five of the seven tanks engaged surviving to reach the rally-point. The 1/8th Warwick suffered only 15 wounded and the tank crews, two men killed and 11 wounded, inflicting about 100 casualties on the Germans and taking 30 prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, both Cicero and Quintilian are {{sources for}} the story that Scopas, the Thassalian nobleman, refused to pay Simonides in full for a victory ode that featured too many decorative references to the mythical twins, Castor and Pollux. According {{to the rest of}} the story, Simonides was celebrating the same victory with Scopas and his relatives at a banquet when he received word that two young men were waiting outside to see him. When he got outside, however, he discovered firstly that the two young men <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found and, secondly, that the dining hall was collapsing behind him. Scopas and a number of his relatives were killed. Apparently the two young men were the twins and they had rewarded the poet's interest in them by thus saving his life. Simonides later benefited from the tragedy by deriving a system of mnemonics from it (see The inventor). Quintilian dismisses the story as a fiction because [...] "the poet nowhere mentions the affair, although he was not in the least likely to keep silent on a matter which brought him such glory..." [...] This however was not the only miraculous escape that his piety afforded him. There are two epigrams in the Palatine Anthology, both attributed to Simonides and both dedicated to a drowned man whose corpse the poet and some companions are said to have found and buried on an island. The first is an epitaph in which the dead man is imagined to invoke blessings on those who had buried the body, and the second records the poet's gratitude to the drowned man for having saved his own life—Simonides had been warned by his ghost not to set sail from the island with his companions, who all subsequently drowned.|$|E
