5|$|SS Great Britain got our {{unanimous}} {{vote for}} being outstanding at every level. It combines a truly groundbreaking piece of conservation, remarkable engineering and fascinating social history plus a visually stunning ship {{above and below}} the <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Most importantly, the SS Great Britain is accessible and highly engaging for people of all ages.|$|E
5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E

50|$|A {{modified}} reverse, with no <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> at all, was {{put into}} use in 1952. In addition to removing the <b>water</b> <b>lines,</b> this modified reverse was different because {{the image of the}} canoe on the coin had a larger islet tip at the right end. This variety is different from the Arnprior coins in that it was deliberately created.|$|R
40|$|The urban Nicomedeia, {{that was}} built 264 BC, {{had grown up in}} the Roman period and become a great metropole. Together with the {{developments}} like population growth and agricultural developments, the need for water increased and the urgency of mastering water to be able to efficiently use it, made start building of the monumental water works. As a consequence of the findings taken place in the urban Nicomedia, it was been discovered that it had 4 <b>water</b> <b>lines.</b> 23 aqueducts, 18 water conduits, 14 water springs, 2 water wells, 4 cisterns, 7 ventilation and control shafts pertaining to this <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> were been determined and documented. In the light of information acquired from the study of the <b>water</b> <b>lines,</b> the calculation of the inhabitant was been realized and found that these 4 <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> carrying <b>water</b> to Nicomedeia was capable of covering the water need of 174122 people...|$|R
5|$|Rainfall {{and storm}} surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish {{experienced}} flooding, including two with over {{two feet of}} water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the storm cracked a <b>water</b> <b>line</b> in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500people without power {{for a short period}} of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} suffered substantial damage {{during the}} 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor twisted in a corkscrew fashion. On {{the top three}} floors, 80percent of the perimeter walls were damaged. A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor. An elevator shaft and five floors were flooded when a mechanical <b>water</b> <b>line</b> ruptured. There were no injuries but {{it was estimated that}} the repairs would cost $6million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E

50|$|In December 1955, the Royal Canadian Mint made up {{an order}} of 2,000 silver dollars for a firm in Arnprior, Ontario. These coins had 2 and ½ <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> at the right end of the canoe. This {{was similar to the}} {{accidental}} disappearance of <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> on the versions from 1950-1951. The 1955 dollars caught the interest of many collectors and it was this version that led to the term Arnprior being applied to any dollar with an appearance of missing <b>water</b> <b>lines.</b> An even more collectible of the 1955 Arnprior, is given by the die break on the obverse legend, with the result being the joining of the T and the I in GRATIA.|$|R

5|$|On {{their way}} in, the rowing boats had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion {{grounded}} {{to the north}} of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two obsolescent multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E

40|$|Dental unit waterlines (DUWL) are an {{integral}} part of dental surgery equipment, supplying water as a coolant, primarily for air turbine and ultrasonic scalers. Dental unit <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> (DUWL) used to irrigate the oral cavity during routine dental practice is highly contaminated. Concern about indoor air quality is increasing, and more attention is being laid on the aerosol and splatter produced during dental procedures 1. The source of bacterial contamination within the dental unit water supply is thought to be caused by micro-colonies of proliferating bacteria, fungi and protozoa on the inner surface of the <b>water</b> <b>lines,</b> forming a biofilm 2. The unique feature of dental chair <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> is the capacity for rapid development of a biofilm on the dental <b>water</b> supply <b>lines</b> combined with the generation of potentially contaminated aerosols. The present review emphasizes the underlying biological cause of waterline colonisation by microorganisms, the evidence of potential health consequences and possible means of improving the quality of dental water...|$|R
5|$|The Mary Rose {{represented}} a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought {{much like that}} on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, {{they needed to be}} placed lower in the ship, closer to the <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the Mary Rose was built. This made broadsides, coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible {{for the first time in}} history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered galleys that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{atmospheric}} transmission spectra {{were calculated}} from 800 to 860 nanometers for laser sources with spectral widths {{of a few}} tenths of a nanometer. In this spectral region, the atmospheric absorption <b>lines</b> (<b>water</b> <b>lines)</b> have linewidths of a few hundredths of a nanometer, so that the transmission coefficient for a relatively wide laser pulse must be computed by taking a weighted average over the pulse spectral width. Laser spectral widths of several tenths of a nanometer are shown to reduce the effective absorption by <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> to as little as 10 to 20 percent, even when the laser is centered on a line or overlaps several lines. Thus, the effect of absorption by atmospheric <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> may be greatly reduced for laser communication systems using laser diode array transmitters, for which the pulse spectral width may be a few tenths of a nanometer...|$|R
