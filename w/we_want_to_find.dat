The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage."

Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years.

2500|$|Around 1996 {{many artists}} began {{moving into the}} Third Ward. In 2011 Danyahel Norris, a Third Ward {{resident}} and a legal research instructor and attorney at Texas Southern University, said that he observed {{the first sign of}} gentrification in the Third Ward in 2000, when a crack house was converted into a high-end residence. By 2004, many wealthier African Americans and Whites began to move into the Third Ward area. Some activists in the Third Ward area created campaigns encouraging area residents to not sell their homes to new residents to avoid gentrification and re-development. By 2006 many townhouses appeared in the area across the freeway from the Third Ward, with childless couples, empty nesters, and yuppies occupying the movements. Garnet Coleman—a state representative from the area—expressed his opposition to gentrification and a desire to keep the original residents in the neighborhood. Coleman had some control over the Midtown Tax Increment Financing District, which bought land in the Third Ward and enacted deeds restricting what may be done with the land, so that the land could indefinitely be used to house low income residents. In 2009, Coleman said [...] "We learned a lot from the debacle in the Fourth Ward. So it would be stupid not to respond to the negative byproducts of rapid development. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> people who will make this community better by becoming part of its fabric, not by changing its fabric." [...] In 2010 Norris published an article in the Thurgood Marshall Law Review stating how existing Third Ward residents could continue to keep their properties, including enforcing deed restrictions; because the City of Houston does not have zoning, many Houston neighborhoods use deed restrictions to maintain their existing setups and atmospheres.|$|E
