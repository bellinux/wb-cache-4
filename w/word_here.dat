25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative <b>word</b> <b>here</b> being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but even there he has to admit it is only as suspicion.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{pronounced}} {{in detail in}} Parthian art is the painted murals. Numerous examples are available in Dura Europos. Some examples are from Palmyra and Hatra and fragments of wall paintings {{have been found in}} Ashur and Babylon. Many of the murals come from temples and houses of worship. In the synagogue and the church of Dura Europos there are mainly scenes from the Bible. In Mitraeum there are scenes of the deity Mithras. In some temples of the city there are figures of donors and their family members prominently depicted. Residential buildings were much less likely to be painted in the Parthian world than in the Greco-Roman <b>word.</b> <b>Here</b> banquet and hunting scenes illustrate the life of the nobility and ruling class.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the <b>word</b> <b>here</b> translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E

[...] "Her" [...] - 'in this year' - is the usual opening for an Old English annal and the typical form of the letter 'r' might easily be misread for an 'n'.|$|E
500|$|The Matrix, who {{produced}} six songs for Lavigne, five of which {{appear in the}} album, had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi", and [...] "I'm with You", which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, [...] "Avril {{would come in and}} sing a few melodies, change a <b>word</b> <b>here</b> or there." [...] Reid complemented the issue over the credits: [...] "If I'm looking for a single for an artist, I don't care who writes it.

2500|$|The text {{does not}} mention widowhood, and other {{translations}} differ in their translation of the <b>word</b> <b>here</b> rendered as 'pyre' (yoni, literally [...] "seat, abode"; Griffith has [...] "first let the dames go up to where he lieth"). In addition, the following verse, which is unambiguously about widows, contradicts any suggestion of the woman's death; it explicitly states that the widow should return to her house.|$|E
2500|$|The Hebrew [...] is {{translated}} as [...] "thou shalt not take in vain".

2500|$|... "Tarry this night": Or [...] "lodge here tonight", {{where she}} was. This he said not from any design upon her, {{but for her}} own safety and honour, that she might not be exposed to danger or disgrace, by {{returning}} home at such an unseasonable time of night. The Hebrew letter נ [...] "nun" [...] in the word ליני lî-nî for [...] "tarry" [...] is larger than usual in the Hebrew text; which may be done to raise {{the attention of the}} reader, to observe it as a thing very singular, that a widow should lodge with a man without any diminution of her chastity; so Buxtorf says, that hereby attention is noted, even the honesty of Boaz ordering Ruth to lodge without a man, and wait until a nearer kinsman, according to the law, should come, and promising that on failure thereof he would be the lawful redeemer. But Dr. Lightfoot observes, that as there is a special mark over a word in the story of Lot's eldest daughter lying with her father (a dot above the letter י [...] "yod" [...] of last Hebrew word in Lot's eldest daughter gave birth to Moab, the progenitor of Ruth's tribe) and a special mark on this <b>word</b> <b>here,</b> in the story of Ruth going to Boaz his bed, seems to relate one to the other, and both together to point at the great providence of God in bringing light out of darkness, Ruth, a (fore)mother of Jesus Christ, out of the incest of Lot.|$|E

5000|$|There {{may also}} be a play on <b>words</b> <b>here,</b> using arami in two senses - as both arami, [...] "an Aramean", and rama′i, [...] "a deceiver", since Laban cheated Jacob (Genesis Rabbah 70:19). In this interpretation, arami personifies the Israelite peoplesꞌs bitter enemy.|$|R
