500|$|The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two {{surviving}} victims, {{was originally}} offered to Christopher Reeve {{based on his}} work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in Above Suspicion (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist. The part was later accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a [...] "funny situation" [...] with Oldman wanting a prominent [...] "credit". She said: [...] "Now how can you have a prominent credit with Hannibal? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't <b>work</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> (at first)." [...] Oldman was apparently [...] "out" [...] of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go [...] "unbilled". Oldman would become transformed and [...] "unrecognizable as himself" [...] to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist Greg Cannom said: [...] "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures , and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy." [...] Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to [...] "do it anonymously" [...] under the heavy make-up. In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.|$|E

On 5 June, Mussolini told Badoglio, [...] "I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought".
