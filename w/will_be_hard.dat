25|$|In November 2008, U Gambira, {{a leader}} of the All Burma Monks' Alliance, was {{sentence}}d to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> labour; other charges against him are still pending. In early 2009, his sentence was reduced to 63 years. His sentence was protested by Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience. Both groups called for his immediate release. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012, and as of 11 December 2012, was released on bail.|$|E

UK broadcaster Channel 5 posted an official statement: [...] "With so many enemies, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to narrow down who had the motive to harm him. Who pushed P.R?". Jane Badler who plays Diana Marshall in the serial compared the storyline {{to that of the}} Who shot J.R.? storyline from American soap opera Dallas.

500|$|Litigation, {{ultimate}} {{roll call}} of damage, and {{the scope of}} final insurance recovery were all unknown , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve. A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large that it really is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E
500|$|Don Turnbull {{reviewed}} Tomb of Horrors in issue No. 13 of {{the magazine}} White Dwarf, and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull commented on the adventure's difficulty, noting that the dungeon is [...] "sprinkled extensively with subtle, insidious and carefully laid traps, {{and it will be}} a fortunate adventurer who manages to avoid them". He felt that the illustration booklet would add a great deal to the adventure's atmosphere and felt that the pre-generated character roster was useful. Turnbull noted that the module is [...] "very hard and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for the DM to learn in advance, though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules", and he said that this module has in common with those modules an [...] "excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced.

500|$|Opening night {{reviews of}} the musical were {{strongly}} positive. [...] Richard Watts in the New York Post termed it [...] "nother triumph for the masters". Critic John Mason Brown stated, [...] "They have done it again." [...] The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: [...] "This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and The King and I is a beautiful and lovable musical play." [...] Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in The New Yorker, who wrote, [...] "Even {{those of us who}} find [...] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to take pleasure in the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them."

Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that Duff sounds {{like she is}} bored and [...] "going through the motions" [...] on the song. She further stated that Duff has [...] "lost her sauciness and ironically, her spunk" [...] in the song. Avoledo concluded her review by calling [...] "the bland electro pop" [...] song an [...] "insult to the genre. It's like spilling ramen on a Vivenne Westwood evening gown." [...] A reviewer from CBBC Newsround commented that the song is so repetitive that you will feel like [...] "you've listened to it 20 times after just one play". The reviewer praised the heartbeat present on the track, writing that it [...] "make it {{a bit of a}} foot-tapper", but deemed the lyrics to be [...] "meaningless". The reviewer concluded that: [...] "You'll find yourself humming it but <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> pushed to remember what on earth she was singing about!" [...] Spence D. of IGN wrote that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] does not try for subtlety as it utilizes the [...] "much overused heartbeat" [...] for the [...] "foundation rhythm" [...] of the song.|$|E

[...] "The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for Jack." [...] In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for Kabletown. When asked by a contributor from The Philadelphia Inquirer why the characters on 30 Rock refer to the network's new owner as [...] "Kabletown, with a K", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name [...] "Cabletown", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department [...] "wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2012, {{the writers}} told GameSpot that God of War will [...] "improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals {{by taking a}} step in a bolder direction." [...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done.

500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested {{with a healthy}} dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to match." ...|$|E
