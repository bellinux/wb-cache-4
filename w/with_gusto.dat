5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work <b>with</b> <b>gusto,</b> {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E

Irishman (and therefore British subject) Gerald Griffin, had been given a dictation test in Dutch, which he had failed as he was meant to do. In his memoir Australian Landfall, Kisch records <b>with</b> <b>gusto</b> how Griffin then entered Australia under a false name and led the authorities a merry dance as he popped up unannounced to speak at meeting after meeting.|$|E
25|$|On 18 August 1893, {{at the age}} of 24, Lee {{became a}} {{professor}} of Strategy and Tactics, at the Royal Military College of Canada, in Kingston, Ontario, with the local rank of captain. Since only 11 to 30 cadets annually entered the College in those days, Lee would have instructed only about 140 cadets in his five years at the College (1893–1898), consisting of cadet numbers 320 to 457. Cadet No. 433, future Major General Thomas Victor Anderson, D.S.O., a future Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, recalled that Lee was known around the Royal Military College as 'The Nipper, which the cadets christened him because he used to sing George Grossmith's songs <b>with</b> <b>gusto.</b> He enjoyed riding and walking in winter across the ice to Wolfe Island, and to town. He was a regular attendant at St. George's Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) to hear Dean Buxton Smith. When Colonel Gerald Kitson, K.R.R.C., became RMC Commandant in 1897, Captain Lee came to live with the Kitsons in the Commandant's residence. In 1894, Lee initiated a Military Survey of the Canadian Frontier, and supervised its progress until its completion in 1896. During the summer of 1897 he was a Special Correspondent for the London Daily Chronicle, covering the earlier stages of the Klondike Gold Rush, based on his travels to Alaska and the Yukon. In 1900, when Lee resigned as British Military Attaché in Washington, D.C., Colonel Kitson resigned as Commandant of RMC to take over the Washington post vacated by Lee.|$|E

500|$|Kent Hughes {{took to the}} Chairman role <b>with</b> <b>gusto,</b> {{although}} his relationship with Brundage was never cordial. During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes {{was quoted as saying}} that he had enough to worry about without having [...] "Chicago blow-ins come out here and blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1961, {{shortly before}} the second court case on Thunderball, Fleming {{had a heart attack}} during a regular weekly meeting at The Sunday Times. While he was convalescing, one of his friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and {{suggested}} that he take the time to write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell to his son Caspar each evening. Fleming attacked the project <b>with</b> <b>gusto</b> and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that [...] "There is not a moment, even {{on the edge of the}} tomb, when I am not slaving for you"; the result was Fleming's only children's novel, Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang, which was published in October 1964, two months after his death.|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{approached}} the project <b>with</b> <b>gusto,</b> remarking that he [...] "wrote an adaptation from {{a novel that}} tells about the fascist mice who are nibbling away at our country while we're busy fighting a good war". Stewart believed Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views, and felt vindicated by the assignment, declaring that [...] "here was my compensation for the sabotage of my radical attempt to do my bit...". The script was the proudest moment of his entire career. Stewart, however, had extensive problems adapting the novel for the screen, and filming—originally due to begin in June 1942—was delayed for several months while {{he worked on the}} screenplay. He consulted with the Bureau of Motion Pictures in the U.S. Office of War Information, an agency of the federal government created in June 1942 to promote patriotism and warn the public about domestic spying.|$|E

500|$|On 19 November 1963, {{the case}} of McClory v Fleming, {{following}} up the 1961 case, was heard at the Chancery Division of the High Court. The proceedings lasted three weeks, during which time Fleming was unwell, suffering a heart attack as the case progressed. Two weeks after the case, during the weekly Tuesday staff conference at his employers, The Sunday Times, Fleming suffered a serious, second heart attack that necessitated convalescence, which he undertook at the Dudley Hotel in Hove. While there, one of Fleming's friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to read and suggested that he {{took the time to}} write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell his son Caspar each evening.

500|$|Rupert {{also played}} a {{prominent}} role in the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–74). This time Louis XIV of France was a key English ally against Holland, and it was decided that the French would form a squadron in a combined fleet. The English fleet had been much expanded, and Rupert had three ships, , [...] and , equipped with a high-specification, annealed and lathe-produced gun of his own design, the Rupertinoe. Unfortunately the cost of the weapon—three times that of a normal gun—prevented its wider deployment in the fleet. The French role in the conflict proved a problem when Charles turned to the appointment of an admiral. Rupert's objection to the French alliance was well known, and accordingly the King appointed the Duke of York to the role instead. Rupert was instead instructed to take over the Duke's work at the Admiralty, which he did <b>with</b> <b>gusto.</b> The Allied naval plans were stalled after the Duke's inconclusive battle with the Dutch at Solebay.|$|E
500|$|Manchester City's officially {{recognised}} supporters club is the Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), {{formed from}} a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA). There {{have been several}} fanzines published by supporters; the longest running is King of the Kippax {{and it is the}} only one still published. The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of [...] "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out <b>with</b> <b>gusto</b> {{as though it were a}} heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results [...] "typical City". Events that fans regard as [...] "typical City" [...] include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58), or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it [...] "gave all {{the main characters}} an opportunity to shine" [...] and that the episode [...] "delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level." [...] He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional sitcom. Entertainment Weeklys Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, [...] "Jackie Jormp-Jomp". Writing for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a 30 Rock classic it [...] "had more than enough funny things in it to keep me satisfied." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that [...] "The Ones" [...] felt [...] "a little stock" [...] {{but that it was}} [...] "just pretty good." [...] He further added that [...] "" [...] gag featured in this episode [...] "was mildly amusing but a little obvious." [...] He felt that Elisa's secret felt more like a Soap opera secret than a 30 Rock one. Nonetheless, Rabin gave [...] "The Ones" [...] a B-. David Bauder of the Guelph Mercury, however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are [...] "the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role <b>with</b> <b>gusto,</b> matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step".|$|E

2500|$|Through {{the process}} of Japanisation (Nipponisation), {{schoolchildren}} and adults are being instructed by the Japanese authorities to go to nihon-go classes that were established around the island to learning Japanese language.

A general assembly in the school hall will be held every day before classes began and Japanese national anthem will be played with students must sung <b>with</b> <b>gusto</b> followed by bowing to the Japanese flag before marching off to their classrooms. This was done to make the population to “think, feel and act like Japanese East Asians”. Their treatment however divided between the local indigenous people and Chinese immigrants.

2500|$|La Guardia loathed the gangsters {{who brought}} a {{negative}} stereotype and shame to the Italian community. His first action as mayor was {{to order the}} chief of police to arrest mob boss Lucky Luciano on whatever charges could be found. La Guardia then went after the gangsters with a vengeance, stating in a radio address to the people of New York in his high-pitched, squeaky voice, [...] "Let's drive the bums out of town". In 1934 he went on a search-and-destroy mission looking for mob boss Frank Costello's slot machines, which La Guardia executed <b>with</b> <b>gusto,</b> rounding up thousands of the [...] "one armed bandits", swinging a sledgehammer and dumping them off a barge into the water for the newspapers and media. In 1935 La Guardia appeared at The Bronx Terminal Market to institute a citywide ban on the sale, display, and possession of artichokes, whose prices were inflated by mobs. When prices went down, the ban was lifted. In 1936, La Guardia had special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, a future Republican presidential candidate, single out Lucky Luciano for prosecution. Dewey led a successful investigation into Luciano's lucrative prostitution operation, eventually sending Luciano to jail with a 30–50year sentence. The case was made into the 1937 movie Marked Woman, starring Bette Davis.|$|E
