5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he was hoping that the Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for,</b> and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Los Angeles in 2005–06, Cammalleri {{established}} himself as an NHL regular, appearing in 80 games with the Kings and leading the team with 26 goals. He improved to 34 goals and 80 points in 2006–07 and was voted {{the recipient of the}} Bill Libby Memorial Award as the Kings' most valuable player by the local media. He and the Kings were unable to agree on a new contract following the season. Cammalleri <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> $6-million per season, while the team offered $2.6 million. The two sides went to arbitration, where Cammalleri was awarded a two-year contract that paid him $3.1 million then $3.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Because Lichfield {{had been}} {{established}} by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield. Coenwulf's embassy bore {{a letter to the}} pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury.|$|E

25|$|The airport {{operating}} company {{made an agreement}} with a local farmer to make a joint bid for the lot, whereby the farmer would receive agricultural land and the {{operating company}} the airport facilities. The lot {{was at the time}} valuated at NOK2 to 3 million, while Solberg <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> NOK10 million. The company withdrew the offer to sell the airport in 1999. A long-term lease was agreed upon in 2000. The airport received NOK4 million in subsidies from the CAA, which were used to upgrade the runway and drainage system. The airport reopened on 11 August 2000.|$|E

Crockett Promotions was under new ownership and both Zbyszko and Perez were essentially left without an angle. Zbyszko signed with the AWA in January 1989 and the NWA Western States Heritage Championship, which Zbyszko still held at that point, was subsequently retired.|$|E

25|$|In September 1809 William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory, invited the Potawatomi, Lenape, Eel River people, and the Miami to a meeting in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the negotiations, Harrison promised large subsidies and payments to the tribes if they would cede the lands he <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for.</b> After two weeks of negotiating, the Potawatomi leaders convinced the Miami to accept the treaty as reciprocity, because the Potawatomi had earlier accepted treaties less advantageous to them {{at the request of}} the Miami. Finally the tribes signed the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, thereby selling the United States over 3,000,000 acres (approximately 12,000km²), chiefly along the Wabash River north of Vincennes, Indiana.|$|E
25|$|Despite all this, the Bulgarians {{still wanted}} to become a hegemonic power in the Balkans and made {{excessive}} claims to this end, while Serbia asked for more territory than what was initially agreed with the Bulgarians. Serbia <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a revision of the original treaty, since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers' decision to establish the state of Albania, in an area that had been recognized as a Serbian territory of expansion under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Bulgarians also laid claims on Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia. In the conference of London, Venizelos rebuffed these claims, citing the fact that it had been occupied by the Greek army, and that Bulgaria had denied any definite settlement of territorial claims during the pre-war discussions, as it had done with Serbia.|$|E
25|$|Caine's {{previous}} three novels {{had been published}} by Chatto & Windus, but after the success of The Deemster Caine was determined {{to have a different}} form of contract to receive royalties and retain the copyright. He discussed the contract with Chatto & Windus throughout November 1889 but on 6 December Andrew Chatto amicably wrote to refuse the terms, stating that the sales of The Deemster, although great, did not justify the contract and the substantial advance that Caine <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for.</b> Caine then turned to Heinemann, which was seeking the novel to lead the launch of the new publishing company. Caine had been introduced to Wolcott Balestier, the business partner of William Heinemann, not long before by his friend, Bram Stoker. Because Heinemann were willing to outbid Chatto & Windus, and include Caine's retention of the copyright, Caine moved to Heinemann.|$|E

Four dimensions of working time were investigated, notably number of working hours, timing of work, predictability {{and control over}} hours, and commuting time. Although almost all questionnaires <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> hours worked, the terminology varies greatly. In {{only half of the}} cases a reference period is taken into account and in half the reasons for working more/less in the survey week than usual <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> Contractual hours <b>are</b> hardly <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> and so <b>are</b> paid and unpaid overtime hours. The timing of work <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> in a minority of the questionnaires, and predictability and control over working hours is also not a major issue. The incidence of an on-call contract is the most likely proxy for predictability...|$|R
25|$|On 2 July 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev {{said that}} the refit of the carrier should be {{completed}} {{as soon as possible}} so she could be delivered to India in 2012. On 7 December 2009, Russian sources indicated that final terms had been agreed on, but no delivery date was set. On 8 December 2009, it was reported that India and Russia ended the stalemate over Admiral Gorshkov price deal by agreeing on a price of US$2.2 billion. Moscow <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> US$2.9 billion for the aircraft carrier, nearly three times the price that was originally agreed between the two sides in 2004. On the other hand, New Delhi wanted the price to be scaled back to US$2.1 billion. Both governments finalised the price of Admiral Gorshkov at US$2.35 billion on 10 March, a day ahead of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to India.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, BUA {{became a}} growing {{burden on the}} Cayzers' {{as a result of}} its disappointing {{financial}} performance, a situation made worse by the unexpected loss of one of its most important IT customers to the newly formed BEA Airtours. This led to an approach to both corporations, with the intention of selling BUA to one of them. BEA, which was approached first, refused because it considered the price Sir Nicholas <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> BUA — £9 million — too high. A subsequent approach to BOAC proved to be more successful. Sir Keith Granville, BOAC's then MD, agreed to purchase BUA from B for £7.9 million. Roy Mason, the President of the Board of Trade, gave the Government's preliminary approval to BOAC's proposed takeover of BUA, on the understanding that there were no realistic prospects of a merger with another independent airline as recommended in the Edwards report.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan, {{upon hearing}} of the debacle, {{dispatched}} three armies to Albania. Skanderbeg, upon learning of the sultan's plans, immediately marched into Macedonia. A large force under Hasan bey set out to march into Albania through the same pass as Sinan a month before, unaware that Skanderbeg was ready to meet him. While the Ottomans were idle, Skanderbeg ordered the enemy guards to be killed and a full-scale battle soon ensued. Most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed and Hasan himself was wounded by an arrow piercing through his right arm. Despite {{the fact that most}} of his army was annihilated and that it was late at night, he took some of his most loyal soldiers up into a more secure place. Skanderbeg came to understand this the next morning and immediately set off to find him. Out of desperation, Hasan came out unarmed and surrendered to Skanderbeg asking for mercy. Skanderbeg gave Hasan what he <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> and the latter was taken prisoner.|$|E

25|$|Between 197 and 198, Yue Jin {{followed}} Cao Cao {{to subdue}} Zhang Xiu, who feigned surrender and defeated Cao at the Battle of Wancheng. Much hardships were experienced during the campaign, but Yue Jin, along Yu Jin, was recorded to have earned merit during the battles. Due {{to the fact}} that Zhang Xiu was backed by Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, Cao Cao realised Zhang could not be taken care of within a short period of time. Under the rationale that Liu Bei <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> help in Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) to fight Lü Bu, Cao Cao finally relinquished his war against Zhang Xiu, and sent envoys to ask Zhang to form an alliance, which Zhang agreed upon the term that a marriage be arranged between the two families. During the siege of Xiapi, Yue Jin led a separate command and defeated one of Lü Bu's deputies outside the city before he joined the encirclement.|$|E
25|$|Following the corporations' intervention, BEA Airtours {{acquired}} seven former BOAC Boeing 707-436s. These aircraft had {{a greater}} seating capacity than required and were powered by four Rolls-Royce Conway engines, an older generation engine type than the four Pratt and Whitney JT3D turbofans which powered the ex-American 707-123Bs it had originally selected to replace its Comet fleet. This meant that the ex-BOAC 707s had higher operating costs. However, BOAC was prepared to sell these aircraft to BEA Airtours {{at a lower price}} than American <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> its planes. The £4.3m sale price included BOAC's entire spares holding (inclusive of engines) for the seven aircraft. This helped compensate for the cost differential. The first of these 174-seat aircraft entered service in 1971 while the last aircraft of this batch joined the fleet in 1973. By that time, four of the airline's nine Comet 4Bs had already been withdrawn from service and sold to rival British charter airlines.|$|E
25|$|In a {{rally in}} Buxar on 26 October, Modi vowed to defend {{reservation}} of Dalits, STs, OBCs. He said of the Mahagathbandhanthat {{it was trying to}} hatch a conspiracy to carve out a sub-quota on the basis of religion as the Supreme Court of India has said reservation cannot be more than 50%. On 27 October, in Bettiah, he again accused Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav of diluting the share of SC, ST and OBC. It promoted the view that an attempt was being made to take the reservation of Dalits and other OBCs and give it to other minorities. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also agreed with Modi's assertions that the idea of reservations on the basis of religion is fraught with danger. On 1 November, Modi repeated the allegations that the two leaders came together in July 2005 to demand a review of the policy to provide for religion-based reservation. A video dating from 2005 which was leaked showed Lalu <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a quota for Muslims. On 3 July, BJP announced its seventh morcha, the BJP OBC Morcha, reportedly in regards to the election.|$|E
60|$|Dr. C. J. Romanes {{tells of}} a female {{chimpanzee}} who was taught to count straws up to five. She held the straws in her hand, exposing the ends to the number requested. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three, she held up three. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> four, she held up four. All this is a mere matter of training. But consider now, Mr. Burroughs, what follows. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> five straws and she had only four, she doubled one straw, exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number. She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct? If Mr. Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction, he may call Dr. Romanes a nature-faker and dismiss the incident from his mind.|$|R

25|$|A second {{statutory}} declaration was filed on 1 July 2008 by Abdul Razak Baginda's private investigator P Balasubramaniam, disclosing then deputy Prime Minister Najib's links and Altantuya. Bala said the police omitted {{information about the}} relationship between Najib and Altantuya during their investigation. In the {{statutory declaration}} Abdul Razak had told Balasubramaniam that the deputy prime minister had a sexual relationship with Altantuya and that the trio had dined together in Paris. Detailed conversations in a statutory declaration revealed which Abdul Razak was in effect inherited Altantuya as a lover from Najib, who passed her on because he didn’t want to be harassed as deputy prime minister. Among other lurid details, Balasubramaniam described text messages between Najib and Abdul Razak in which the latter <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> help to avoid arrest, implying Najib personally interfered with the murder investigation. In making his statutory declaration, Balasubramaniam mentioned that a man in a blue Proton Saga happened to be driving pass the home of defence analyst Abdul Razak Baginda at that time of the day before Altantuya was reported missing on 19 October 2006 and revealed that the man was Nasir Safar, the special advisor to Najib Abdul Razak.|$|E
25|$|In 1274 a {{long and}} {{expensive}} suit was begun between the prior and convent of Dunstable and Eudo la Zouche, who had become lord of Houghton and Eaton Bray by his marriage with Millicent de Cantelow. Eudo refused to recognise {{the rights of the}} prior (established not only by charter, but by long custom) to a gallows and prison in Houghton; he released one of his men from the prison and overthrew the gallows. Under the next prior, William le Breton, the gallows was restored; but Eudo still refused to recognise the prison as the prior's right, and presently erected a gallows of his own. The dispute went on for some years, and, after the death of Eudo, was continued by his wife Millicent until the year 1289, when it was finally decided in favour of the prior. The poverty and difficulties of the house went on increasing, although great efforts were made, after the deposition of William le Breton and other officers of the monastery in 1279, to curtail expenses and get in ready money for the payment of debts. Corrodies and chantries were granted to several persons, manors and churches were let out to farm, and in the year 1294 the usual allowance for one canon was made to serve for two. It was just at this time that the king <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> subsidies for his Welsh war. By an accumulation of misfortune, in the same winter the outer walls of the priory had collapsed in the wet weather, and their hayricks had been destroyed by fire; and the tithes due to the Hospitallers from North Marston church were in such long arrears that a new arrangement had to be made to pay them off. In 1295 the house at Bradbourne was so poor that all the wool produced there had to be granted to the support of the three brethren who served the church and chapels. The later pages of the annals are a long story of poverty and struggle to get clear of debt; and the continuous narrative ends dismally enough with the account of the expenses of the installation of John of Cheddington, which amounted (with the addition of the debts of the previous prior) to £242 8s. 4d.|$|E
