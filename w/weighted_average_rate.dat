50|$|As of 2009, {{the average}} birth rate (unclear {{whether this is}} the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> per country each country getting a weight of 1, or the {{unweighted}} average of the entire world population) {{for the whole world}} is 19.95 per year per 1000 total population, a 0.48% decline from 2003's world birth rate of 20.43 per 1000 total population. According to the CIA - The World Factbook, the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s, birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July, 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline. Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent. In July, 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone. This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years. By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in the last year. Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span. In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, {{despite the fact that it}} implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of rates {{and patterns of}} soil erosion on agricultural land cultivated with sugarcane was undert a ken using the 137 Cs technique, USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) and WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) model. The study was carried out on a representative catchment of a small watershed of the Piracicaba river basin, State of São Paulo, Brazil, called Ceveiro watershed, well known for its severe soil degradation caused by erosion. The results from the 137 Cs technique indicate that most part of the studied area (94 %) are eroded at erosion rates that go up to 59 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, with a <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of 23 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. The <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of infield deposition and sediment retrieval that occurs in only 6 % of the total area {{was estimated to be}} around 12 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. These values led to very high net soil loss from the field, with rates of the order of 21 Mg ha- 1 y- 1, which represents a sediment delive ry ratio of 97 %. A linear correlation between soil erosion rate estimated by the 137 Cs technique and the amount of available K in the top soil layer (0 - 20 cm) was observed. Based on this correlation the estimated amounts of net and gross K loss in the grid area due to soil erosion were of 0. 2 and 1. 52 kg ha- 1 y- 1, respectively. The erosion rate estimated by USLE was 39 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 and by WEPP model 16. 5 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 with a sediment delivery of 12. 4 Mg ha- 1 y- 1 (75 %). The results are a confirmation that the soil conservation practices adopted in the area are very poor and can explain the high siltation level of water reservoirs in the watershed...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of monetary policy upon real output and {{the inflation rate}} is well established. The influence is exercised through the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This study has examined the pass-through of Treasury Bill rate to money market rate (Call Money rate), Banks’ Deposit rate and Banks’ Lending rate. The broader conclusion is that pass-through from Treasury Bill rate to Call money rate is completed during the first month. However pass-through from Treasury Bill rate to Deposit rates and the Lending rate takes much longer, that is, these rates exhibit rigidity. The results are in conformity with the empirical evidence in the relevant literature for other countries. In practice, the pass-through to the deposit and the lending rates {{is expected to be}} quicker than evidenced in this study. The reason is that the study uses weighted average deposit and lending rate. Given that the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> takes into account outstanding deposit/loans contracted at previous rates as well, (besides the fresh deposit/loans contracted at new rates) this tends to tone down the pass-through. ...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{countries}} and regions is possible {{thanks to their}} adequate infrastructure. The globalization of economic processes {{has contributed to the}} increase in the intensity of the movement of all kinds of goods, which is possible due to the transport infrastructure. Transport is one of the functional systems of logistics, which covers all activities consisting in the movement of material goods, people and information, in time and space, with appropriate technical equipment. Thus, it constitutes an element of the technical infrastructure of logistics. Road transport is the main branch of Polish transport both in terms of the mass of and the revenues from the freight. Therefore the authors have conducted an in-depth study of the logistics infrastructure of the freight transport by road, not only for Poland, but also for other European countries. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the concentration of the elements of the road transport infrastructure and to examine the competitiveness of companies providing road transport services in selected European countries in the years 2001 - 2011, and to examine the road network saturation. The following indices were used in the analysis: Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index, location quotient, <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of road network density and Engel's road network density index. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index measures the concentration and determines the estimated level of concentration in a given industry and the level of competitiveness on a given market. The location quotient determines the level of the analyzed variable in relation to the so-called reference variable and allows one to determine whether the analyzed area has a higher level of the variable in a given section, compared to the average for the reference area, whether there is a potential shortage of certain activities in the examined area, or whether the level of a feature in a given area is sufficient. <b>Weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of the road network density refers to the density of the road network in relation to the area and population of a given country. The Engel's network density ratio in turn takes into account, apart from the area and population, the size of the transported goods. The performed analyses provide information on the uniformity of equipment in the road transport infrastructure of the examined countries and show similarities and differences in the road network saturation. The applied measures allow one to compare the analyzed countries in terms of the discussed variables, and in particular: the total length of motorways (kilometers), annual road freight transport (thousands of tonnes), length of e-roads (kilometers) length of other roads (kilometers), number of goods road transport companies...|$|E

A systematic search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases was conducted. Studies {{were included in the}} review if they reported cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation within 30 days of the index operation. Results were evaluated qualitatively due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Incidence rates were pooled using a weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. A total of 835 records were initially identified, from which 32 full texts were retrieved. Following review, 13 studies were included that involved 52, 959 patients, of whom 10. 94 % (95 %CI 7. 22 - 15. 33) developed atrial fibrillation. Five studies of patients undergoing oesophagectomy (n = 376 / 1923) had a <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> of 17. 66 % (95 %CI 12. 16 - 21. 47), compared with 7. 63 % (95 %CI 4. 39 - 11. 98) from eight studies of non-oesophageal surgery (n = 2927 / 51, 036). Identified risk factors included: increasing age; history of cardiac disease; postoperative complications, particularly, sepsis, pneumonia and pleural effusions. New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation is common, and is more frequent after surgery involving the thorax.

40|$|The {{use of a}} Declining Discount Rate (DDR), in {{cost-benefit}} analysis (CBA), {{compared to the use}} of a Constant Discount Rate, implies that the policy maker will put relatively more effort to improve social welfare in the far distant future than in the shorter time. The choice between the two discount rates is crucial and linked, for example, to the problem of whether we should fight malaria and AIDS (which have immediate effects) rather than climate change (which is expected to have important long-term effects). In this paper we assess the willingness to pay for (very) distant benefits, which should inform the desirability of policies and projects with immediate costs and distant benefits. DDRs offer an approach to balancing current costs and distant benefits. First we present the existing theoretical justifications for using a DDR, which are mainly driven by the uncertainty of future economic conditions, and show how a theory-consistent optimal trajectory of theDECLINING DISCOUNT RATES 2 DDR can be estimated. For this empirical estimation, we use regime-switching models of the optimal trajectory of the DDR for nine ‘representative ’ countries. We then compose a <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>rate</b> {{that can be used in}} CBA of long-term projects that affect the global environment and economy. Finally, we investigate the policy implications of applying this optimal trajectory on the cost-benefit evaluation of carbon mitigation policies and compare our results with those of the Stern Review. This comparison provides empirical evidence that support the major criticism of the Stern Review of assuring high damage numbers by using an arbitrary low and constant discount rate. Our main point in this paper is that when uncertainty is introduced, the case for DDRs and the availability of a reliable empirical method for their estimation become compelling for CBA of long-run policies and projects.
