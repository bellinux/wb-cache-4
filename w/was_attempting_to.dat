5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E

Wollaston <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes.
