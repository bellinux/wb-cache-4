5000|$|In 1871, Columbus, Indiana {{attorney}} Colonel John A. Keith contracted for a two story {{building to}} be erected {{on the south}} side of Third Street between Washington and Franklin streets (today, 425 Third Street). This building was known as Keith's Arcade, but it is not known who the architect and builder were. Keith's Arcade was called an [...] "arcade" [...] building because of its architectural design, and had nothing to do with any amusement descriptive qualities of the word. A series of arches graced the facade, <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> <b>doors</b> and windows. Three arches adorned the top, and within the three arches, the words, [...] "Keith's Arcade A.D. 1871", were incorporated into the upper part of each arch. [...] From 1871 to 1889, merchants and businessmen from all walks of life rented out space in Keith's Arcade. Today's Republic newspaper got its start there in April, 1872. During the 18 years the building functioned as Keith's Arcade, it was home to restaurants, a plumbing supply store, law offices, and a clothing shop, to name a few.|$|R

The large wooden entrance doors were damaged by flying fragments of metal and glass. Damage to interior walls occurred 25 feet inside the temple, but damage to the interior was minor.

50|$|The {{brown marmorated stink bug}} is {{more likely}} to invade homes in the fall than others in the family. The bug survives the winter as an adult by {{entering}} houses and structures when autumn evenings become colder, often in the thousands. In one home more than 26,000 stinkbugs were found overwintering. Adults can live from several months to a year. They will enter under siding, into soffits, <b>around</b> window and <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> chimneys, or any space which has openings big enough to fit through. Once inside the house, they will go into a state of hibernation. They wait for winter to pass, but often the warmth inside the house causes them to become active, and they may fly clumsily around light fixtures. Two important vectors of this pest are the landscape ornamentals Tree of Heaven and Princess Tree.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{public concern}} about the past use of polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) containing building caulk in schools has prompted expensive caulk removal projects {{at a time of}} limited public resources. Building caulk, used during construction to fill narrow gaps <b>around</b> windows and <b>door</b> <b>frames,</b> was often formulated with PCBs to increase its plasticity and durability. This PCB use was banned in 1978, but even three or more decades later, schools with PCB containing caulk may still have detectable levels of PCBs in indoor air. The USEPA (2010 a) has expressed concern that the inhalation of these airborne PCBs may be a significant exposure pathway for children. Despite their presence in buildings for more than 30 years, there have been no reported adverse health effects attributable to PCBs in building caulk or other building materials. Health concerns about PCBs in schools are based on results of risk assessment models that rely on toxicity factors derived from animal studies. The USEPA has opted to use animal studies for estimating PCB risk to peopl...|$|R
50|$|European pioneer {{farmers in}} the prairies of North America, {{where there is no}} wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a sod house. The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks 1 by 2 ft, which were then piled up to form the walls.The sod strips were piled grass-side down, staggered {{in the same way as}} brickwork, in three side-by-side rows, resulting in a wall over 3 ft thick. The sod wall was built <b>around</b> <b>door</b> and window <b>frames,</b> and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them. The roof was made with poles or brush, covered with prairie grass, and then sealed with a layer of sod.Sod houses were strong and often lasted many years, but they were damp and dirty unless the interior walls were plastered.The roofs tended to leak, and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm.|$|R
