500|$|Historian Gilbert Chinard {{wrote in}} 1936: “Lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol {{so early in}} his life, and {{successive}} generations have so willingly accepted the myth, that any attempt to deprive the young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious.” That legend has been used politically: the name and image of Lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 in seeking to gain popular support for America's entry into World WarI, culminating in the famous phrase, [...] "Lafayette, we are here". This occurred at some cost to Lafayette's image in America: veterans returned from the front singing [...] "We've paid our debt to Lafayette, <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> do we owe now?" [...] A longer-term threat was the increasing sophistication of Americans and the lessened need for symbols of patriotism; by 1971, according to Anne C. Loveland, [...] "Lafayette no longer served as a national hero-symbol." [...] In 2002, however, Congress voted to grant Lafayette honorary citizenship.|$|E

Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, [...] "I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday".

2500|$|The Band {{gained a}} {{nickname}} while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss {{as he passed}} the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once.

Field Marshal Foch supposedly said 'hoity-toity' (show-off in French) {{in response to the}} drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall.
