He still opposed private property in land: [...] "What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on."

Henceforward, singles' sides were not usually identified as [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B", but each bore a unique matrix number in a series starting at wipx 1002. The matrix number appeared on the label, usually upside-down directly beneath the main catalogue number. The matrix numbers seem to have been allocated to each release in numerical sequence, irrespective of the actual or proposed release date of the record; thus the two sides of WIP-6056 (Jethro Tull's [...] "Living In The Past" [...] b/w [...] "Driving Song") have matrix numbers wipx 1010 and wipx 1011, respectively. Initially, the new matrix numbers were used in conjunction with the existing [...] "eye" [...] label design, but beginning with releases in June 1969 a new pink label design was introduced, known as the [...] "block" [...] design.

Based primarily on the writings of Bhaskar (19751998) contemporary critical realism is an ontologically-based philosophy of science that attempts to answer the question ‘what must reality be like to make science possible?’ (Bhaskar 1975). A key feature of critical realism is what Bhaskar refers to as the ‘epistemic fallacy’; by which he means the tendency to couple ontology and epistemology and to confuse that <b>which</b> <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> the knowledge we have about it (what we believe).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Given the {{production}} technology of a multiproduct firm, economists usually try to represent this technology by functions, namely the cost function, the revenue function and the {{input and output}} distance functions. In doing so the analysis directs the attention to the (dual) matching of quantities and prices. Here, the duality scheme is based on Mahler’s inequality and stresses dual aspects of associated functions, whereas the underlying optimization problems are not dual programs. Nevertheless, the discussion of shadow pricing reveals the similarities <b>which</b> <b>exist</b> <b>with</b> respect to some appropriately chosen dual programs...|$|R

30|$|In YAMATO, the {{representation}} of a quality is distinguished from a real quality <b>which</b> <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> an entity. Therefore, representations of qualities and quantities are defined as transformations of a real quality through an “action to measure.” The measure contains a part-of slot that indicates a “result” role played by a primitive representation. A quality measurement {{is defined as a}} role-holder performed by a proposition in a content role subslot of the result role slot. Through measurements, the data are approximations of real qualities, and a quality value representing a true value is independent of any measurements. Therefore, representations of a quality must be distinct from representations of a quality obtained through measurements (Masuya et al. 2011).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the extent to}} which trade liberalization, de-regulation of economic activity, privatization of public assets and more careful management of macroeco-nomic aggregates, are affecting Latin America. The background, set in import substituting industrialization, has given way to transition towards a new productive structure and new methods of organization of manufacturing activity. Part of that is the relative rise of industries based on the processing of resources. Industrial labour productivity improved in the early 1990 s after a long period of stagnation, which became very apparent in the 1980 s, though the achievement of an 8 % per annum rate, and much shedding of labour, has been insufficient to close the gap <b>which</b> <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> the US.
