5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to {{know a great deal}} more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike. The show's head writer and {{executive}} producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was “not in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading {{to the end of}} the season , <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again,” and there would have been a strong football element as well, Katims said. Seven of the 22 episodes NBC ordered for Season 2 weren’t made.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been all}} alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There {{would have been}} a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|My first {{experience}} shooting {{was with my}} older brother when I was 14.

25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, apparent power can {{be calculated}} from this.

25|$|Note {{that using}} a {{hierarchical}} system like this (assuming {{it is done}} carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence {{on the number of}} objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this.|$|E
25|$|Ray Kurzweil, a {{computer}} pioneer and self-proclaimed Singularitarian, argues in The Singularity Is Near that the coming Singularity requires that Earth {{be the first}} planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen evidence that another culture had experienced the Singularity and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.|$|E
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength.

But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E

25|$|Even though Berke was Muslim, he was {{at first}} {{resistant}} {{to the idea of}} fighting Hulegu out of Mongol brotherhood; he said '"Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> conquered all of the world"; but the economic situation of the Golden Horde due to the actions of the Ilkhanate led him to declare jihad because the Ilkhanids were hogging the wealth of North Iran and the Ilkhanate's demands for the Golden Horde not to sell slaves to the Mamluks.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{to take out the}} show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. That {{is not what}} happened here. It was a deportation. And {{even if it were}} a rendition, we understand as a government what our obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this government to another country, and that is that we seek to satisfy ourselves {{that they will not be}} tortured. And we do that in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E

25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.|$|E
25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
