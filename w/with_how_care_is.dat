40|$|Lynn Butler-Kisber, McGill University Mary Stewart, LEARN Quebec The Importance of Care in the Publishing Process In {{this paper}} we will {{highlight}} <b>with</b> stories <b>how,</b> when <b>care</b> <b>is</b> {{integrated into the}} various steps in the publication process of qualitative work, it creates a thoughtful dialogue, enhances the ultimate product and scaffolds learning about both content and methodology, without sacrificing quality. Much {{has been written about}} the importance of the care in educational contexts (Noddings, 2005). Care refers to “a set of relational processes that foster mutual recognition and realization, growth, development, protection, empowerment, and human community, culture and possibility”—in learning situations (Owens, Ennis, 2005, p. 392). However, little attention has focused on the role that care can play in the publication process. Publications are frequently tied to outcomes such as promotion and tenure with little consideration about how the actual process can contribute to the development of both practitioner and academic authors and their participants. Care in the publication process contributes to how qualitative research gets delivered accessibly, transparently, and poignantly. References Noddings, N. (2005). The challenge to care in the schools.

40|$|This change project {{involves}} the commissioning of a Short Stay Observation Unit (SSOU) within a DATH’s Hospital. SSOU’s deliver intensive short-term assessment, observation or therapy to selected ED patients to optimize early treatment and discharge. Observation medicine in dedicated units is {{a feature of}} many adult Emergency Departments (ED) but {{this has not been}} reflected in children’s ED’s in Ireland. The current literature supports the development of SSOU’s, indeed it is very much in line with the new National Model of Care for Paediatrics in Ireland and the new National Children’s Hospital. Developing a unit can be challenging and there is much to be considered when selecting the governance structure, choosing suitable conditions, staffing and developing metrics to help monitor its performance post opening. The creation of this new unit required a cultural change <b>with</b> regard to <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> delivered within the hospital. This required a change to the “day to day” practices of the consultants and nurses. Such changes can be difficult in large, complex healthcare organizations. However, the underlying assumption of this project is that the patient comes first and that SSOU’s are designed to prioritise the patient and not staff, management or finances. The rational for the change is to streamline ED services by transferring observational patients from ED to the SSOU thus reducing ED waiting times and inpatient admissions. The HSE Model of Change (2008) was used to guide and manage the change process. The projected was evaluated against the project objectives, a nursing survey (n= 55) and nurse management focus group (n= 5) was also used to evaluate the success of the project.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{analysis}} of a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) in the American Midwest. I examine salient aspects of American culture, and how persons in the American Midwest understand relationships and themselves {{in the context of}} eldercare, and particularly, how issues of personhood and kinship are conceptualised in a long-term care facility. Rather than focusing exclusively on just the labour of caregivers, or how the residents in the CCRC receive <b>care,</b> my study <b>is</b> grounded in the interaction and relations that obtain during specific regimes of caregiving. Because the exigencies of ageing are met with certain exigencies of care, this study touches upon three dominant themes that make sense of the tensions that emerge when principles and practices do not square up. The first theme deals <b>with</b> <b>how</b> ageing and <b>care</b> <b>are</b> constituted, and made relational to one other. Secondly, I demonstrate that in the CCRC where I conducted fieldwork, ageing is constructed as a process and institutionalised, resulting in a distinctive way in which space and time are dealt with and unravelled from their inextricability. The resulting consequences affect not just the older residents and the CCRC staff, but also impacts how caregiving takes on specific forms and meanings. Thirdly, I investigate how formal (professional) caregivers and care receivers produce a type of social relation, which cannot be understood alone by conventional studies of kinship and economic relations. Ultimately, this thesis sets the frame for future debate on the ontological commitments involved in eldercare, and how the segregation of care and of the elderly in society relate to wider social norms regarding ageing and marginality...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} built around the {{following}} research question: "How do student nurses conceptions regarding their future profession change during their training in the three year nursing programme?" The study is longitudinal in character and consists of qualitative interviews conducted with eighteen students belonging to the same nursing class. The students were interviewed on four occasions during the nursing programme. The data collection started in the spring 1992, when the students were admitted to the programme, and ceased in the spring 1995 when the education was completed. The research approach chosen for the thesis is phenomenography, and the method used is contextual analysis. The result is described {{in the form of}} four interim studies, where the students' conceptions of the nursing profession are presented in categories. The different categories can be brought together to form two main categories, describing an 'instrumental conception' and a 'relational conception' of the nursing profession. The 'instrumental conception' is linked to a medical perspective on the nursing profession, which coincides <b>with</b> <b>how</b> today's medical <b>care</b> <b>is</b> organised, while the 'relational conception' is linked to a social and behavioural science perspective, which corresponds with the direction given in the curriculum. However, irrespective of which category of conception they belong to, all student nurses relate the nurse's interventions to the patient's well-being. It was not possible to identify a pattern in the students' development or change of perspective during their education. However, it is mainly the male students (5 / 6) who represent the relational conception, while the female students (8 / 10) represent the instrumental conception. The results show that nursing education does not lead to a unitary conception of the nursing profession, since the students, due to their preunderstanding and earlier acquired perspectives, conceive the different aspects of the profession in qualitatively disparate ways...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ideologies of care, or {{systems of}} {{beliefs about the}} {{importance}} of particu-lar goals and activities, help guide <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> provided. One currently pervasive ideology of <b>care</b> <b>is</b> that of normalization. In this paper, the ideologies of care of both house managers and direct care staff in group homes are contrasted. Results indicate that the ideology of d irect <b>care</b> staff <b>is</b> less differentiated than that of the house managers. In addition, house managers are more l ikely to subscribe to a normalizat ion ideology and less l ikely to subscribe to a family orientation ideology than <b>are</b> direct <b>care</b> staff. Ideological differences between house managers and direct <b>care</b> staff <b>are</b> only part ia l ly explained by differences in the demographic composition of the two groups. In the human service arena, certain principles and goals help guide <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> provided to clients. For example, normalization has been a guiding principle for the provision of services to individuals {{with a wide variety of}} disabilities, particularly individuals with developmental dis-abilities (DD) and mental illness (MI). Despite the pervasiveness of the concept of normalization as an ideology of care, much disagreement remains about he meaning of the term, and about how to operational...|$|R

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question: How do employees experience the organizational value care? The organization Nortec introduced care {{as one of its}} organizational values. The application of care in business may counteract and combat possible undesirable side effects of increased organizational efficiency. Some reported side effects experienced by employees are colder and more demanding working environment (Maslach & Leiter, 1997). Therefore I was intrigued to study <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>was</b> experienced by employees within an organization that had already put care on the agenda and applied it as an organizational value. <b>Care</b> <b>is</b> an ambitious value and may not be straight forward to implement into the workday’s interactions. A total of four employees, two subordinates and two leaders, were interviewed <b>with</b> regard to <b>how</b> they experienced <b>care</b> at work. The qualitative semi-structured interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analyzed. The analysis returned a total of four categories that were labeled as: Perception of care, Experience of care, Trust and Attentiveness. All four categories contributed into the understanding of the experience of care for each of the informants. The perception would determine the informant’s expectation of care, according to which the informants rated their experience. Finally the last two categories, trust and attentiveness were considered basic constituents for applied <b>care</b> to <b>be</b> recognized. In the theory section I proposed a model of care composed of various dimensions representing my pictorial understanding of care. However, the empirical findings returned with a revised model where the main constituents of <b>care</b> <b>were</b> trust and attentiveness. All informants revealed these dimensions as significant in the care experience. Also, the findings indicated a difference in experienced care between the subordinates and the leaders. Both subordinates expressed low level care in terms of trust and attentiveness from leader, whereas the leaders did not convey a similar discontent. The study reveals essential information about <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> experienced for the participants and consequently <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> recognized inside the specified relations. The study provides important information towards possible future studies to identify whether the same trends are identifiable through a quantitative study in the organization. Finally all information from this study and future studies would add significant value into the management’s strategic leadership development to increase understanding and employee contentment and to root the care value within the company’s DNA...|$|R

40|$|Background Although {{self-management}} interventions are, to some extent, individualized {{in clinical}} practice, {{the decision-making process}} is not fully understood. Exploring nurses' clinical reasoning about how {{and to what extent}} they currently tailor self-management support can provide new insights, enhancing process and outcome of chronic care. Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} explore how nurses assess chronic patients concerning the potential of self-management and clinical reasoning with regard to tailoring care to the individual patient. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using grounded theory. Semistructured interviews were held with 15 nurses working within chronic <b>care.</b> All interviews <b>were</b> carried out from February to July 2013. Results All nurses provided individualized care; however, a nurse's view of self-management influenced how tailoring was performed. Substantial differences were seen in patient assessments and <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>was</b> individualized. Patients' motivation, capacities, mindset, needs, and preferences were obtained through communication, experience, intuition, and trusting relationships. A typology with four patient types emerged: the unmotivated patient, the patient with limited capacities, the oblivious patient, and the ideal patient. Nurses elaborated on using different approaches for patients in each of these groups. Discussion A nurse's perception of self-management substantially impacted <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>was</b> individualized. Patient assessment was the key driver of tailoring, which was performed in various ways, and influenced how and the extent to which <b>care</b> <b>was</b> individualized. To enable responding to the unique wishes and needs of individual patients, both scientific and educational efforts need to be directed toward systematic assessments of patient capacity to self-manage their disease...|$|R

The local authorities also have very much freedom in deciding <b>how</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> to be conducted and what fees the individual recipients are to pay. Public care of the elderly {{during the first half}} of the 1900 s consisted only of institutional care. The first efforts to provide care at home began around 1950 and developed rapidly, culminating in about 1978 (Szebehely, 1995). After that, the trend reversed, the number of elderly persons who received care at home declining rapidly. This was due to economic developments at the time and to those who received care at home needing increasing amounts of care.
