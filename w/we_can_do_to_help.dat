You {{all know}} just HOW MUCH {{suburban}} legends {{have been through}} throughout the years! .... lets all gather to HELP THEM through this!I just {{got a call from}} my dear friend MIKEY, bassist for Suburban Legends.They are on tour in Philly and woke up to head down to the van and trailer from the hotel room and the van and trailer were stolen.Every piece of equipment and merchandise the band owns is gone.Drum sets, horns, clothing, basses, guitars, amps, etc.The value of the equipment alone is appx 40k. The value of the trailer alone is 30k. Estimated value of everything is probably close to 80k (in my estimation) including the van, trailer and gear.They are troopers and going to try and rent another van, rent gear and finish the tour.This is devastating. Most, if not ALL of you know just how dear and sincere these guys are and how close I am with them.Is there ANYTHING <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them?My idea was to find someone with money who would be able to immediately front them an investment for gear and work out terms for the band to pay that person back. Or does someone here have connections to a car dealership? Instruments? SOMETHING!?!Please help!if you have some help or ideas, PLEASE, lets help the guys out!" ...|$|E

40|$|Assessment is {{probably}} the most important thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> our students learn. We may not like it, but students can and do ignore our teaching; however, if they want to get a qualification, they have to participate in the assessment processes we design and implement. For that reason I believe it is worth thinking through, individually and collectively, what we currently do and exploring how we can do our best to ensure that our assessment practices help rather than hinder learning. In this paper I will explore these issues, play with a negative exercise about {{what we can do to}} hinder learning and conclude with some pointers towards integrating learning and assessment...|$|E

40|$|So {{often when}} we speak of {{transformative}} learning, we focus on what takes places within the individual. As educators, we try to understand how it occurs and what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> it occur, taking more of a stance of doing rather than one of being. In creating the conditions for transformation, we cannot forget the importance of our relationship with students. This article considers transformative learning as a relational process and explores {{the nature of the}} student–teacher relationship as a place within which transfor-mation is made possible. Understanding it as such calls us to participate with students in creating communities of care in our learning environments, which hold relationships in a way in which we can both challenge and support one another in negotiating mean-ing, expanding horizons, and taking shared responsibility for co-creating a better world...|$|E
40|$|What {{morality}} requires {{of us in}} a {{world of}} poverty and inequality depends both on what our duties are in the abstract, and on what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> T. M. Scanlon's contractualism addresses the first question. I suggest that contractualism isolates the moral factors that frame our deliberations about the extent of our obligations in situations of need. To this extent, contractualism clarifies our common-sense understanding of our duties to distant others. The second, empirical question then becomes vital. What we as individuals need to know is how to fulfil our duties to the distant poor. Moral theorists tend to base their prescriptions on simple assumptions about how the rich can help the poor. Yet a survey of the empirical literature shows how urgently we need more information on this topic before we can know what contractualist morality — or any plausible morality — requires of us...|$|E
