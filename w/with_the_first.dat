5|$|Opinions {{are divided}} {{as to where}} in {{biological}} evolution consciousness emerged and {{about whether or not}} consciousness has any survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> humans, (ii) exclusively <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> reptiles. Other authors date the origins of consciousness to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of consciousness. Each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value of consciousness.|$|E
