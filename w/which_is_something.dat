25|$|In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union {{took over}} Mogadishu from CIA-backed ARPCT. Iran {{has been one}} of several nations backing the public uprising. According to Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Ghedi, Iran, Egypt, and Libya are helping the militia. The Prime Minister accuses these {{countries}} of wanting more conflict in Somalia, which seems contradictory because of the Transitional Government's inability to extend authority beyond Baidoa, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> the Islamic Republic sees.|$|E
25|$|Palahniuk was cajoled to {{continue}} Fight Club in comics form by fellow novelist Chelsea Cain and comic writers Brian Michael Bendis, Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeConnick. A teaser {{was released by}} Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with Fight Club 2 #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that has always fascinated Palahniuk.|$|E

25|$|The decorations:On {{one side}} of the {{courtyard}} is the temple proper, on a raised dais four feet high. The building and decorations are exquisite; the shafts of all the arches are of polished white marble inlaid with flowing flowery patterns in coloured marbles. The walls and ceiling and every available inch are painted richly, the prevailing colours being blue and gold, but all so artistically blended that the eye only takes in the general effect, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> like that of a Cashmere shawl.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|Discovery bay {{has only}} one current sport ground at the moment, the astroturf next to the {{community}} centre located in the north plaza (there is also a pitch located in-between the two Primary schools) <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that the Discovery Bay community feels that they need at the moment. With the amount of space in this area, residents feel that a sports ground is needed. Sport is very popular in Discovery Bay {{with a number of}} sport teams. Recently, there was a protest in the plaza to let Hong Kong Resorts know that everybody wants a sports ground. The government refuses to provide any assistance or land.|$|E

25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} was apparently intended to improve upon {{the account of}} Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the Theaetetus. But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing koina is an active thinking process in the rational {{part of the human}} soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this sensus communis, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} from the types mentioned above. Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound {{eye and the}} single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes. Then there is the mysid shrimp Dioptromysis paucispinosa. The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye {{there is a single}} large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone. This projects an upright image on a specialised retina. The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.|$|E
60|$|After {{that several}} days went by slowly. At times Tom seemed {{to improve and}} then he would sink back, {{sometimes}} becoming quite wild, so the others had to watch him closely. But he grew stronger physically, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> to <b>be</b> thankful for.|$|R

500|$|Nolan {{has said}} that the film [...] "deals with levels of reality, and {{perceptions}} of reality <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> I'm very interested in. It's an action film set in a contemporary world, but with a slight science-fiction bent to it," [...] while also describing it as [...] "very much an ensemble film structured somewhat as a heist movie. It's an action adventure that spans the globe".|$|E
500|$|The drama was {{produced}} by Gareth Gwenlan, who worked on Only Fools and Horses between 1988 and 2003. Speaking to the Western Mail, he described it as [...] "essentially a love story" [...] between Joan and Freddie, {{and he said that}} Lyndhurst [...] "told me he thinks it's the best thing he's ever done". Speaking about the casting of Lyndhurst, he said he [...] "would make a marvellous villain, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> people will never have seen him do on TV before".|$|E
500|$|The roughly 40-minute {{score was}} {{recorded}} {{in the summer of}} 2006 at Capitol Studios in Hollywood, California. Conti chose to pre-record the string, brass and piano tracks and then have those tracks mixed with the work of a 44 piece orchestra which he conducted. He also performed all of the piano work himself <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> he has done with each movie for which he has composed the score. Stallone also was involved in every part of the process and attended several of the recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Critics warmly praised Passport to Pimlico on its release. Several critics {{identified}} that the script was excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that [...] "the chief credit for... joy {{of a film}} should go to T. E. B. Clarke". The unnamed reviewer for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "every line, every 'gag', is a little masterpiece of wit", while the critic C. A. Lejeune, writing for The Observer, thought that the writing and direction were excellent; {{she went on to}} record that [...] "the end comes too soon, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that can be said of very few films".|$|E
500|$|Although Arafat lived {{a modest}} lifestyle, Dennis Ross, former Middle East {{negotiator}} for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, stated that Arafat's [...] "walking-around money" [...] financed a vast patronage system known as neopatrimonialism. According to Salam Fayyad—a former World Bank official whom Arafat appointed Finance Minister of the PNA in 2002—Arafat's commodity monopolies could accurately {{be seen as}} gouging his own people, [...] "especially in Gaza which is poorer, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that is totally unacceptable and immoral." [...] Fayyad claims that Arafat used $20 million from public funds to pay {{the leadership of the}} PNA security forces (the Preventive Security Service) alone.|$|E

25|$|These moves proved successful, {{because after}} {{dropping}} {{the season opener}} to the Wizards, the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that the Mavericks {{had been unable to}} do the last two seasons.|$|R
500|$|On November 12, 2016, Valencia {{was traded}} to the Seattle Mariners in {{exchange}} for pitcher Paul Blackburn. General manager Jerry Dipoto said: [...] "What we see is primarily is shared time at first base with Dan Vogelbach, give a day off or DH day at third base for Kyle Seager, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> we haven’t had the flexibility to do and (Valencia) can also go play either corner (outfield) spot. He’s a flexible corner piece that we see as an every day or near every day player, using him at a variety of different positions... Last year, he had 500-plus plate appearances. We envision a similar type of workload." ...|$|E
500|$|In writing {{music to}} match The Astonishings narrative, Dream Theater ended up {{playing in a}} wide variety of styles, from {{cinematic}} instrumentals to mellow ballads to the band's more conventional progressive metal. Compared to previous Dream Theater albums, there is more acoustic playing, both in terms of guitar and piano. In an interview with Ultimate Guitar, Petrucci specifically mentioned the song [...] "A Life Left Behind", recalling, [...] " [...] starts with an acoustic, kind of proggy riff, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> we've never done and has a very Yes sort of feel." [...] Several songs introduced new elements to the band's music, such as [...] "The X Aspect", which is the first Dream Theater song to use bagpipes, and [...] "Three Days", which features a saloon-style swing section that was written as a juxtaposition to the bleaker aspects of the album's story. Five of the album's tracks are short, electronic songs that represent the music of NOMACS.|$|E
500|$|More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger {{has written}} of Yellow Submarine: [...] "The album {{would have been}} far better value if it had been {{released}} as a four-song EP... {{with the addition of a}} bonus track in [...] "Across the Universe"... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that [...] "the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered" [...] and describes [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] as [...] "a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [...] by a good margin the best song here". Richardson concludes: [...] "But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> the Beatles so rarely were otherwise." ...|$|E
50|$|Susan Roman voiced James in the film. Originally, he {{was played}} by {{television}} Series UK narrator Michael Angelis, {{who was to}} also voice Percy.
