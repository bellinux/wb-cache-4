In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he <b>was</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E

Under Edge's management, the Dorland Agency grew into multimillion-dollar advertising agency, with offices in numerous cities in the United States and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967.

When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E

Instead, a month after their arrest, they were escorted {{across the border to}} Mozambique. From there, Mbeki went back to Lusaka for a few months before being posted to Nigeria in January 1977. Before leaving Lusaka, Mbeki was appointed as deputy to Duma Nokwe in the Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP). Mbeki's mission in Nigeria was to establish diplomatic relations with Olusegun Obasanjo's regime, – a mission that proved to be quite successful as Mbeki was to build a lasting relationship with the Nigerian authorities, eclipsing the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in Nigeria. Zanele, who <b>was</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> Africa offices of the International University Education Fund in Lusaka, spent much of 1977 with her husband in Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|The 1909 {{death of}} Carlos VII turned {{political}} fortunes of de Cerralbo, who consulted {{by the new}} claimant Don Jaime advised that as a Carlist king he should adopt the name of Jaime III. Many distinguished Carlists pressed the pretender to dismiss Feliú and re-appoint Cerralbo. The claimant bowed to the pressure in 1912, creating a collective governing body, Junta Superior Central Tradicionalista, with de Cerralbo as its president. A number of authors claim that de Cerralbo was the de facto Jefe Delegado and the press, like many contemporaries, presented him as such. The competitive theory maintains that de Mella, sensing the forthcoming clash with Don Jaime, assumed that aging and sick Cerralbo, his old-time friend, {{would be easier to}} manipulate; some claim that following the appointment it was actually de Mella who <b>was</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> party.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Stevie Wonder {{had become}} one of the most popular figures in R and pop music, not only in the U.S., but worldwide. Within a short space of time, the albums Talking Book, Innervisions and Fulfillingness' First Finale were all {{back-to-back}} top five successes, with the latter two winning Grammy Award for Album of the Year, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. By the end of 1975, Wonder became serious about quitting the music industry and emigrating to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He had expressed his anger with the way that the U.S. government <b>was</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> country. A farewell concert was being considered as the best way to bring down the curtain on his career. Wonder changed his decision, when he signed a new contract with Motown on August 5, 1975, thinking he was better off making the most of his career. At the time, rivals such as Arista and Epic were also interested in him. The contract was laid out as a seven-year, seven LP, $37 million deal and gave him full artistic control, making this the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Almost at the beginning Wonder took a year off from the music market, with a project for a double album to be released in 1976.|$|E
