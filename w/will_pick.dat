5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.|$|E
5|$|When eating snails, this rail will hammer at {{the shells}} to extract them. For berries, it will jump high {{to break off}} {{clusters}} of this fruit. After doing this, it <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> off the berries {{one by one and}} eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E

25|$|Mating {{occurs during}} flight {{in the fall}} (and {{occasionally}} winter), and although females may {{have three or four}} embryos in the spring, typically only twins are born in late May or early June. If their maternity roost is disturbed, mother yellow bats <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> up their pups and carry them to a safer roost. Baby bats become volant (able to fly) between June and August, and will form evening feeding aggregations with adult females while adult males remain solitary.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> up the slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have {{demonstrated}} grief-like states, especially between {{a mother and}} her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some deer will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a lioness, <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.|$|E

25|$|In Hong Kong, {{because of}} its {{one and a half}} century British rule, many Hong Kong people <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> English names as early as {{attending}} English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to Singapore, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among Hongkongers to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.|$|E
25|$|Female {{choice is}} the final step in the males attempt to reproduce; if the female does not find the male’s traits desirable, {{reproduction}} will not be successful. As it is in most species, body size is an important and most common desired trait amongst females. Body size is indicative of fitness and/or genetic quality; {{and because it is}} easily observable, it can be an indicator for how a female <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> her mate. A larger body size positively correlates to higher paternity; thus larger males are more successful in siring more offspring than smaller males. Male salamanders also prefer larger females because they produce more ova than smaller females.|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> up items they would not normally see.|$|E

Broadcasters for the Sun games on WCTX consist of Bob Heussler and Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti or Kara Wolters. From 2012–2014 Sun games were broadcast on CPTV Sports (CPTV-S).

In addition to Mike Gorman, broadcasters in the past have included Leah Secondo and Kara Wolters.|$|E
25|$|Within the European Union, organ {{donation}} is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries {{have some form}} of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. In the United Kingdom {{organ donation}} is voluntary and no consent is presumed. Individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the Organ Donation Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The opt-out organ donation scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015 and is expected {{to increase the amount of}} donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an opt-out system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British organ donor shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper opt-out system. In 2008, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for an initiative to introduce an EU organ donor card in order to foster organ donation in Europe.|$|E

When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun (Todd Charmont) approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun {{as a member of the}} Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.|$|E

Strong winds <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> up loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from [...] to [...] Such windblown sand causes {{extensive}} damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the Agricultural Research Service studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems. After a period of four weeks {{the growth of the}} seedling once again became uniform throughout the plant, as it was before the windblown sand abrasion occurred.|$|E
