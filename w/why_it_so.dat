According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least culturally) to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E

Water makes a pole of {{difficult}} application, {{except in a}} few cases (494.), because of its small conducting power, its miscibility with most of the substances acted upon, and its general relation to them in respect to chemical affinity. It consists of elements, which in their electrical and chemical relations are directly and powerfully opposed, yet combining to produce a body more neutral in its character than any other. So that there are but few substances which do not come into relation, by chemical affinity, with water or one of its elements; and therefore either the water or its elements are transferred and assist in transferring the infinite variety of bodies which, in association with it, can be placed {{in the course of the}} electric current. Hence the reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> rarely happens that the evolved substances rest at the first surface of the water, and why it therefore does not exhibit the ordinary action of a pole.|$|E

Only at present it means ever so much more, almost unspeakably more, than it has ever done in the past, and I can't help inviting you to feel with me, for a very few moments, what the real force of this association to which we now throb consists of, and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> moves us. We enjoy generous emotions because they are generous, because generosity is a noble passion and a glow, because we spring with it for the time above our common pedestrian pace--and this just in proportion as all questions and doubts about it drop to the ground. But great reasons never spoil a great sympathy, and to see an inspiring object in a strong light never made any such a shade less inspiring. So, therefore, in these days when our great neighbour and Ally is before us in a beauty that is tragic, tragic because menaced and overdarkened, the closest possible appreciation of what it is that is thereby in peril for ourselves and for the world makes the image shine with its highest brightness at the same time that the cloud upon it is made more black. When I sound the depth of my own affection so fondly excited, I take the like measure for all of us and feel the glad recognition I meet in thus putting it to you, for our full illumination, that what happens to France happens to all that part of ourselves which we are most proud, and most finely advised, to enlarge and cultivate and consecrate.|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{connection}} between spin-dependent SFs of nucleons and nuclei {{in the deep}} inelastic lepton scattering. The case of the deuteron is studied in detail in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. 1 Brief introduction In the present talk we discuss the spin-dependent structure functions (SF) of nuclei and their relation to those of nucleon. Our main focus will be the deuteron, which we study in detail in the covariant Bethe-Salpeter formalism. <b>Why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> important and interesting to study the nuclear effects in the SFs? First, nuclei are {{the only source of}} the experimental information about neutron SFs, including the spin-dependent ones. To obtain this information, {{it is important to understand}} how nucleons are bound in the nuclei and how this binding affects their SFs. An accurate method to extract the neutron SFs from the nuclear data must be an essential part of the consistent analysis of the nucleon SFs. Second, a physics governing the processes with the participation of the nuclei is extremely interesting by itself. For instance, a spin- 1 nucleus, such as a deuteron, has extra spin-dependent SFs than nucleons, i. e. bD 1, 2. Another example, nuclei as a slightly relativistic and weakly bound systems allows for more progress than the hadrons, in studying the covariant bound state problem. In certain situations the covariant approach gives results noticeably different from the nonrelativistic ones. For the spin-dependent SFs such situation is a calculation of the bD 1, 2. And third, our interest in the study of the reactions with the deuteron is in part motivated by the future and ongoing experiments. In particular, very recently we started a study of the chiral-odd SF hD 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis {{is to find}} out <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> often is assumed that {{education}} can and should be neutral between world views, and to argue against this. It is also discussed what the world view basis of the common school should be when neutrality is impossible. The idea of a common school that inculcates common values without taking a stand between different religions and secular world views, is central in today's idea of liberal education. It is argued here that however thin the common basis for the school is, certain world view presuppositions will always be conveyed, at least implicitly. It is easier to see the world view presuppositions in one account of education if it is contrasted with another. An account is given of Christian education, emphasizing its view of reality and human nature, the meaning of life and the corresponding purpose of education. Contrasted with this, an analysis of J. White's and K. Strike's accounts of education based on common values only, shows that they both convey world view presuppositions that are incompatible with a Christian view and therefore not neutral. The argument of incompatibility is strengthened by a discussion of T. H. McLaughlin's three different accounts of common, world view neutral education, Catholic education, and liberal religious education. Several kinds of argument for the possibility and desirability of world view neutral education are analysed, and it is claimed that none of them is valid. Some imply a shallow understanding of religion, others a biased view of education. It is argued that liberal education in many ways is more likely to indoctrinate than Christian education IS. Finally, it is argued that it is desirable to have Christian education in state schools, {{and the degree to which}} this is possible is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} that which forms the 'centre' of Pentecostal Missiology {{and makes it}} particularly relevant to the South African context. In order to arrive at my conclusions I have concentrated on the history and present situation in postapartheid South Africa of the three oldest classical Pentecostal movements, the Apostolic Faith Mission, the Full Gospel Church of God and the Assemblies of God. Chapter one describes {{the rise of the}} Pentecostal movement and its arrival in South Africa shortly after the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899 - 1902). That Pentecostalism took root among the poor in this country is a matter of historical record. The dimensions of poverty in South Africa are probed in order to evaluate Pentecostalism' s success with that class of people. Chapter two examines the Pentecostal model of mission and its essentially holistic nature in order to understand <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> effectively helped the poor to escape the enslaving cycle of poverty. However, Pentecostalism around the world and in South Africa appears to be in crisis. Chapter three discusses the reasons for the crisis and outlines the nature and evidence of it - the 'centre' of Pentecostalism seems to be fragmenting, and with it the relevance of the Pentecostal Church to the South African situation. The book of Exodus provides a metaphor that naturally holds together dimensions of the model of mission essential to Pentecostalism. Chapter four describes the metaphor, how it applies to Pentecostal missiology and why the struggle for the 'centre' is a struggle vital to the mission of the Pentecostal Church. The thesis concludes with a reminder that Pentecostals have a history of 'success' among the poor and that perhaps it is within this stratum of society that Pentecostals should focus their efforts. With a renewed model of mission the Pentecostal Church can still be relevant to the situation of poverty in post-apartheid South Africa. However, Pentecostals need to clarify the distinctives that lie at the 'centre' of their existence and mission and be prepared to struggle for themChristian Spirituality, Church History and MissiologyD.

40|$|Abstract: An {{implicit}} goal {{of sound}} design across different genres {{is to achieve}} a result that 'sounds good'. What this means, {{how it might be}} achieved, and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> often fails in theatre are issues that have rarely been discussed and analysed in an academic context. As audio technologies evolve and cultures of listening change, the question of what 'sounds good' in theatre is continually open to debate. Listening to music or to a 'non-musical' sonic environment can make us feel good, of course, and there is a linguistic connection in English between bodily health and 'soundness' (e. g. to be 'a sound person', 'sound in mind and body'). How does theatre make this connection or achieve this effect? What is the ideological significance of making 'good' sounds/vibrations in performance? Is there a moral as well as an aesthetic component to this? In Sonic Experience: A Guide to Everyday Sounds, Jean-François Augoyard and Henry Torgue discuss the idea of 'sharawadji', which they characterise as 'the feeling of plenitude that is sometimes created by the contemplation of a sound motif or a complex soundscape of inexplicable beauty' (117). The sharawadji, like Roland Barthes' notion of the photographic 'punctum', is an aesthetic effect that strikes the perceiver personally and unexpectedly, possibly the result of accident or chance. (How) might such an effect emerge in theatrical performance? What role, if any, does sound design play in this? This issue will aim to investigate the unspoken assumptions, tacit agreements, aesthetic preconceptions, etc., about what 'sounds good' in the theatre. What do theatre makers and audiences mean when they refer to the sound being 'good'? How do the following elements inform this judgment? • aesthetic appropriateness • affective response • clarity/audibility • timbre • volume • balance/mix • origin & type of sound • acoustics • socio-historical context • audience composition & dynamics • listener expectations How do music, sound effects, voice, dramaturgy, scenography, choreography, technical equipment, environment, and architecture interplay in this endeavour...|$|E
