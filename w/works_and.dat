40|$|Our {{conceptual}} {{paradigm of}} <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family has shifted {{in the past}} decade from one that viewed managing <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family as a challenge to a contemporary view that we are facing a ‘collision’ (Pocock, 2003) between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. This review of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family research begins to explore the shifting conceptualisations, outlining demographic developments before examining key research themes of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family balance, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family conflict, and flexibility as a potential means of achieving <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family balance. Changing work patterns in Australia, such as casualisation, working longer hours and non-standard hours, are investigated as potential contributors to a <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family collision and the pattern to downshifting explored as one strategy adopted by families to attain the best fit between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family and avoid a collision. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{conceptual}} framework for the intersection of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles based on the constructs of <b>work</b> involvement <b>and</b> family involvement. The theoretical and empirical literature on the intersection of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles is reviewed from two analytical approaches. From the individual level of analysis, the literature reviewed reveals three theoretical models which assert: (1) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family are separate role environments (segmented); (2) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles are antithetical (compensatory); or (3) that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family roles are fundamentally similar (spillover). Literature from the couple's level of analysis is then reviewed which presents evidence {{for the existence of}} an inter-spouse relationship. Based on this review, {{a conceptual framework}} is proposed. Included is a table which lists all possible combinations of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family involvement between two spouses...|$|R
40|$|In many {{contemporary}} families, both parents {{are involved in}} paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family responsibilities. This creates challenges for the successful reconciliation of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. In this study, we examined whether and how the division of paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> between partners is related to work–family interference. Analyses were based on survey data of 147 Finnish, 186 German, and 265 Dutch dual-earner couples with young children and {{show that there is}} no recipe for a division of paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> that guarantees a conflict-free reconciliation of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family. Although some cultural variation was identified, in general, individual time spent on paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work</b> appeared to be more decisive for parents’ level of work–family interference than couples’ combination strategies. Therefore, to help working parents it seems important to create opportunities to adjust their time spent on paid <b>work</b> <b>and</b> unpaid <b>work.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|Stress arising in {{the domain}} of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family can have a {{cumulative}} effect, and can spill over across the domains. The work-family interface has  received little attention in teacher stress research, therefore the present study aimed to investigate <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress among teachers. Self-report questionnaires were distributed to 102 female, primary teachers from government schools in the Geelong area. Responses were used to: (a) identify the major <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stressors; (b) identify the contributions of perceived <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress to perceived global stress; and (c) explore the impact that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress have on each other. Overall the teachers reported moderate levels of global, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family stress. Time and workload pressure was the major <b>work</b> stressor, <b>and</b> responsibility for child rearing the major family stressor. <b>Work</b> stress <b>and</b> home stress both impacted on each other.

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family are significant sources of stress. However, {{this research has}} underemphasized the cogni-tive appraisal process by which <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family generate stress. This study used person±environment fit theory to examine how the comparison of <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family experiences to the person's values relates to stress and well-being. Using data from 1758 employees, we assessed fit regarding autonomy, relationships, security, and segmentation for both <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family, and exam-ined the relationship of fit with <b>work</b> <b>and</b> family satisfaction, anxiety, depression, irritation, and somatic symptoms. In general, well-being improved as experiences increased toward values and improved {{to a lesser extent}} as experiences exceeded values. Well-being was also higher when experiences and values were both high than when both were low.
