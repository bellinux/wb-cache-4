[...] Crowther especially liked Sinatra's performance. He wrote, [...] "Mr. Sinatra deserves a special chunk of praise...In Suddenly! he proves it in a melodramatic tour de force." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not every {{situation}} requires the {{axiom of choice}}. For finite sets X, the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>several</b> (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction to prove [...] "for every natural number k, every family of k nonempty sets has a choice function.") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the axiom of countable choice. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (X'i : i∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, {{but there is no}} stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no [...] "limiting" [...] choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.|$|E
