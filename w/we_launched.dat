FX president John Landgraf told Variety, [...] "The {{show had}} a lot of fans, so it was tough to choose [...] Ultimately, we felt that we're just {{not in a position to}} spread our resources. <b>We</b> <b>launched</b> our dramas one at a time, and launching two [...] like we did this summer just didn't work out as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when <b>we</b> <b>launched</b> the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. <b>We</b> <b>launched</b> off saying, how can you make this movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?" [...] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} Faraday {{rotation}} is as follows: When a {{linearly polarized wave}} is propagating along a magnetic field line,it is de-composed into left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized components. The phase difference between them as theyexit the plasma causes the recombined linearly polarized wave to rotate its polarization direction. In MST, <b>we</b> <b>launch</b> two co-propagating, counter-rotating waves to probe the plasma. We then measure the phase {{difference between these two}} beams, which will be twice the Faraday rotation angle.|$|R

We establish a tower of increasingly ambitious conjectures stating, in the most general form, that these properties are sufficient to establish the pure-EKR property in arbitrary dimension.
