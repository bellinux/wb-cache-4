5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{columnist}} William Safire, {{the first}} published use of bork as a verb was possibly in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of August 20, 1987. Safire defines to bork by reference [...] "to the way Democrats savaged Ronald Reagan's nominee, the Appeals Court judge Robert H. Bork, the year before." [...] Perhaps {{the best known}} use of the verb to bork occurred in July 1991 at a conference of the National Organization for Women in New York City. Feminist Florynce Kennedy addressed the conference {{on the importance of}} defeating the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying, [...] "We're going to bork him. We're going to kill him politically... This little creep, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> come from?" [...] Thomas was subsequently confirmed after one of the most divisive confirmation hearings in Supreme Court history.|$|E
2500|$|In 1480 the Vespucci family {{commissioned}} a fresco figure of Saint Augustine for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's. [...] Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. [...] As in other cases, such direct competition [...] "was always an inducement to Botticelli {{to put out}} all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Hebert Lighbown. [...] The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known. [...] Most of the [...] "text" [...] is scribbles, but one line reads: [...] "Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> go? He is outside Porta al Prato", probably dialogue overheard from [...] the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. [...] Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought [...] "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".|$|E
