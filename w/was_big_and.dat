Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali {{had a sense of}} {{everything}} that was happening, almost as though he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, a {{committee}} of 12 leading football coaches led by Pop Warner met to determine the greatest football player of all time. [...] Nevers finished in a tie with Red Grange for second place behind only Jim Thorpe. Warner actually picked Nevers first and noted: [...] "Ernie Nevers played his position {{by far the best}} of any player I ever saw. He had a wonderful physique – <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> powerful yet very active. Nevers was the mental type every coach likes to have on his football team. He was a fine punter, a fine forward passer, a great line plunger and a marvel on defense. Ernie Nevers was a football player without fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world <b>was</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
