[...] And then the tablet was left to Mother Nature and to the silence which is only broken by the soughing of the breeze through the branches and the music of the bee and the katydid [...] Only the wanderer in the hills or the devout pilgrim seeking out shrines of song will find the tablet on the oak. “Dan O ’Connell loved God ’s out-of-doors, ” said Peters <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about the memorial [...] “He delighted in life in the open [...] He was an excellent shot, a skilled fly fisher and an expert yachtsman [...] So it seemed right to commemorate him in the hills and among the trees.” ...|$|E

He flatly {{refused to talk}} about Whitehead, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, he said: 'That SOB never paid me what he owed me. My father had a hauling {{business}} and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to {{where he wanted to}} go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Putin, Abramovich {{has been}} cheated by Igor Kolomoyskyi. Putin claimed in 2014 that Kolomoyskyi had reneged on a {{contract}} with Abramovich, saying [...] "He [...] even managed to cheat our oligarch Roman Abramovich {{two or three years}} ago. Scammed him, as our intellectuals like to say. They signed some deal, Abramovich transferred several billion dollars, while this guy never delivered and pocketed the money. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> : 'Why did you do it?' he said: 'I never thought this was possible.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The above {{explanation}} {{of the origin of}} the term is lacking. As Russell and Norvig in their book [...] have written, referring to the above story: [...] "This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.” Also, there is a comment in a speech by , where he remembers Bellman. Quoting Kushner as he speaks of Bellman: [...] "On the other hand, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the same question, he replied {{that he was trying to}} upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Razzak was {{the only}} Bangladeshi {{to play in the}} 2008 Indian Premier League making him the first Bangladeshi to play the league. He was bought for $50,000 by the Royal Challengers Bangalore and played in only one match. Despite not playing often for the team, Razzak {{believed}} that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that Anil Kumble [...] "was very helpful <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about bowling in Test matches. He told me that given my bowling approach, {{it is very important to}} use variations within my line and length. Actually, captains would want a breakthrough from me so without using variations, wickets are hard to come by. Coach Venkatesh Prasad was also a great help".|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E

60|$|Lov. Uds so, {{look where}} Bibber is: Now I think on't, {{he offered me}} a bag of forty pounds, and the lease of his house yesterday: But that's his pocky humour; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have money, and do not <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> he will offer it; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> he will not lend a farthing.--Turn this way, sirrah, and make as though we did not see him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I appeal," [...] he shouted, [...] "I appeal from Cæsar the Small to Cæsar the Great, {{from the}} murderer of a brave barbarian tribe to the conqueror of the world. O Cæsar, Titus here {{declared}} {{that all he}} has is mine. Yet <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for the gift of one captive girl he refuses me. Command, I pray you, that he should keep his word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} of Father's mysteries. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> about it {{he said that it}} was perhaps the most {{valuable}} thing he had, except one. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what that one was, he refused to tell me, and forbade me to ask him anything concerning it. 'I will tell you,' he said, 'all about it, too, in good time--if I live!'" ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} close behind me, and nodded simply <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> And Will Fotheringay came forward.|$|E
60|$|He was {{speaking}} to himself rather than to me, for he started and seemed confused <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what he meant.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wilks {{shook his}} head. [...] "People {{in the alley}} are {{beginning}} to talk," [...] he said, dolefully. [...] "Just as I came in this afternoon old George Lee screwed up one eye at two or three women wot was gossiping near, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>'im</b> wot 'e'd got to wink about he said that a bit o' wedding-cake 'ad blowed in his eye as I passed. It sent them silly creeturs into fits a'most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is all}} nonsense, Marion. One {{cannot be}} blind about a person {{even if he is}} one's own father. Of course he is very kind and very indulgent, but it would be very much pleasanter if he were so because he wished to give us pleasure, instead of because it is the easiest thing to do. I should be downright pleased if {{sometimes}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for anything he would say positively I could not have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Neco is different," [...] Chebron {{said with}} an accent almost of disdain. [...] "Neco gets into passions and threatens me {{with all sorts of}} things; but I can see he knows no more about it than I do, for he has a bewildered look in his face <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> these things, and once or twice he has put his hands to his ears and fairly run away, as if I was saying {{something}} altogether profane and impious against the gods." ...|$|R
60|$|JENNIFER. He {{said that}} private {{practice}} in medicine ought to be put down by law. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, he said that private doctors were ignorant licensed murderers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not he! If you'll believe me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he wasn't going to, he says, says he, that Mrs. Vavasour's {{company was}} quite payment enough for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Norton {{told me he}} was a {{first-class}} engineer," [...] said Dick, [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he was a good fellow he merely shrugged his shoulders in answer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} what I'm going to do. I 'ave my methods.

6000|$|... "Well;--your great-uncle!--they used to {{trap the}} foxes there. There {{was a fellow}} named Fothergill who used to come there for shooting. Now it is worse than ever. Nobody shoots there because {{there is nothing to}} shoot. There isn't a keeper. Every scamp is allowed to go where he pleases, and of course there isn't a fox in the whole place. My huntsman laughs at me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to draw it." [...] As the indignant Master of the Brake Hounds said this the very fire flashed from his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} had forgotten that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to come, and as I came home I blamed myself {{for not having}} asked someone else, {{so as to make}} up an even number." ...|$|E
6000|$|Where {{had he been}} in his time? he repeated, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the question. Lord, he {{had been}} everywhere! And what had he been? Bless you, he had been {{everything}} you could mention a'most! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you set me free to talk. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to be my}} partner, he told me why he {{had left}} the army. That was the square thing, and it made me keen on getting him." ...|$|E
60|$|One evening, <b>when</b> he yawned, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{how much}} sleep he allowed himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} answer Tertius gave me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if she were handsome. What {{is it that you}} gentlemen are {{thinking}} of when you are with Mrs. Casaubon?" ...|$|R
60|$|Not to make Joe uneasy {{by talking}} too much, even if I {{had been able}} to talk much, <b>I</b> {{deferred}} <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> about Miss Havisham until next day. He shook his head <b>when</b> <b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if she had recovered.|$|R
60|$|With the {{exception}} of the terrible details, Jackson's story of his accident was the same as that I had already heard. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook his head.|$|E
6000|$|I met but {{one human}} being that forenoon, a dark military-looking wayfarer, who carried a game-bag on a baldric; {{but he made}} a remark that seems worthy of record. For <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he were Protestant or Catholic-- ...|$|E

6000|$|I get in {{talk with}} {{a young man who}} has taken the {{orthodox}} side in some debate. He is a stranger, but explains that he has inherited magical art from his father, and asks me to his rooms to see it in operation. He and a friend of his kill a black cock, and burn herbs in a big bowl, but nothing happens except that the friend repeats again and again, [...] "Oh, my God," [...] and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> why he has said that, does not know that he has spoken; and I feel that there is something very evil in the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> {{to let me}} {{look inside}} the cab. I had grasped {{the handle of the}} door, when he {{suddenly}} struck my hat, causing it to fly off. And, while I was picking it up, he drove away." ...|$|R
