5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E

25|$|The revolt, which catapulted Meerut into {{international}} prominence, {{started in}} March, 1857 at Barrackpore, Bengal. Sepoy Mangal Pandey shot and missed two Europeans, failed to kill himself, and was hanged. By April, {{the fire of}} Pandey’s Uprising scorched north India and reached Meerut, the second-largest East India Company garrison. Here, Europeans and native sepoys were evenly balanced, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 2,000 on each side. The European cantonment was separated from the ‘native lines.’ Close by were Sadar Bazar and Lal Kurti Bazar, the latter named after the red uniforms worn by Company soldiers. On 24 April 1857, Meerut’s commander, Colonel CarmichaelSmyth, paraded 90 Indian sepoys of the Bengal Cavalry, hired mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. He ordered them to fire the new Enfield cartridges: 85 refused. The cartridges were covered with paper {{that had to be}} torn off: Muslims believed the paper was greased with pig and Hindus, with cow fat.|$|E

500|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Barbara O'Dair of Rolling Stone {{felt that the}} album was [...] "quietly confident; more ambitious and weirder than Dirty". However, she remarked that the band [...] "saved their integrity {{at the expense of}} quality; <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> grease, their grit might get across better." [...] Lorraine Ali, writing for the Los Angeles Times, praised Gordon's dynamic singing and the guitar playing for giving the album a sleepy and dreamy mood, concluding that Sonic Youth [...] "transcends the confining roles of pretentious art-rock band or palatable alternative group, and instead offers a penetrating album that's all its own." [...] Billboard also praised the album, saying that it offered both noise and melody that [...] "cohabitate exceedingly well".|$|E
500|$|After {{the band}} track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over an unknown, vaguely operatic {{recording}} (possibly captured {{live from the}} radio).

[...] As the piece continues, Lennon quietly mumbles [...] "Gonna be alright" [...] a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, some comments from Lennon and Ono on how well the track has preceded, and final appearances of the tape loops.

500|$|Fuller {{also left}} Star Trek: Voyager after the {{completion}} of the episode, citing disappointment in his lack of control over the show's direction. He said that he [...] "began to get itchy and wanting to tell stories <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> emotional depth", and that he disliked how syndication discouraged longer story arcs spanning multiple episodes. Fuller's episodes frequently focused on [...] "character development through adversity". ExtremeTech's Joel Hruska wrote that the show's later seasons would typically feature Seven of Nine, the Doctor, and Janeway {{to the detriment of the}} rest of the cast, while Fuller would draw more attention to the more underused characters. While discussing the episode, actress Roxann Dawson described the storyline as a [...] "classic Star Trek story" [...] due to its focus on family. The episode features Karen Austin as Torres' mother Miral, and also includes Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries the souls of the dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E

500|$|Despite its chart success, I Want You {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics {{at the time}} of its release. It has been noted by music writers that the critical reception of disco music in general had been poor and ill-considered, which may have caused the slightly disco-styled I Want You to suffer critically, in comparison to Gaye's previous albums. Los Angeles Times writer Dennis Hunt called the album [...] "disappointing" [...] and [...] "only partially commendable". Rolling Stones Vince Aletti criticized Leon Ware's production for being too low-key, and perceived that Gaye lacks the certain passion in his lyricism and singing from his previous records. Aletti compared the album to Gaye's previous work, writing [...] that [...] "Gaye seems determined to take over as soul's master philosopher in the bedroom, a position that requires little but an affectation of constant, rather jaded horniness. The pose has already been established in Let's Get It On, on which Gaye was hot, tender, aggressive, soothing and casually raunchy—the modern lover with all his contradictions. I Want You continues in the same vein but with only the faintest traces of the robust passion that shot through and sustained the earlier album... one expects something <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> substance and spirit. But there's no fire here, only a well-concealed pilot light." ...|$|E

There was more experimentation in making the wines sweeter.

2500|$|Although Fermi {{calculations}} {{are often}} not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does {{tell us what to}} look for to get a better answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago. [...] It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme reasonable values that could appear in each of our assumptions).|$|E
