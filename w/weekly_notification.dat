40|$|Effective disease {{surveillance}} {{is critical}} to the functioning of health systems. Traditional approaches are, however, limited in their ability to deliver timely information. Internet-based surveillance systems are a promising approach that may circumvent many of the limitations of traditional health surveillance systems and provide more intelligence on cases of infection, including cases from those that do not use the healthcare system. Infectious disease surveillance systems built on Internet search metrics have been shown to produce accurate estimates of disease weeks before traditional systems and are an economically attractive approach to surveillance; they are, however, also prone to error under certain circumstances. This study sought to explore previously unmodeled diseases by investigating the link between Google Trends search metrics and Australian <b>weekly</b> <b>notification</b> data. We propose using four alternative disease modelling strategies based on linear models that studied the length of the training period used for model construction, determined the most appropriate lag for search metrics, used wavelet transformation for denoising data and enabled the identification of key search queries for each disease. Out of the twenty-four diseases assessed with Australian data, our nowcasting results highlighted promise for two diseases of international concern, Ross River virus and pneumococcal disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{develop a}} local {{strategy}} for managing cases of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) {{which have been}} identified in the departments of obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G). METHODS: <b>Weekly</b> <b>notification</b> from the local microbiology laboratory to genitourinary medicine (GUM) departments of all positive CT and GC results generated by tests performed in the two local O&G departments. Direct contact made by GUM departments to index patients identified and "fast track" appointments made. Data recorded for future audit include numbers attending, details of health adviser input, and success of contact tracing. RESULTS: Over 18 months, 294 women were identified and 231 (78 %) attended GUM departments; 142 (48 %) had received antibiotics before attending GUM departments and of these, 58 (41 %) had risked reinfection by an untreated partner and 48 (20 %) were found on screening to have a previously undiagnosed genital infection. Over 90 % were interviewed by a health adviser. Appropriate follow up was achieved in 87 % of index cases. Of the contacts, 194 were treated [...] 150 in the local GUM department. Of these 150 men, 99 (66 %) had an identifiable genital infection and 84 % of those with CT/non-gonococcal urethritis were asymptomatic. There have been no complaints either formal or informal, by women managed by this system. CONCLUSIONS: GUM clinics are the ideal setting to achieve successful treatment of patients with sexually acquired infections, which must include notification and treatment of their partners if reinfection is to be avoided. For patients with infections diagnosed on other settings, such as O&G, a system of direct notification of results to GUM departments by an agreed protocol can be highly successful. For such a system to work, close cooperation and trust between departments is essential. ...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacteriosis is {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported foodborne disease in Europe with a notification rate of 71 per 100, 000 population in the European Union in 2014. Surveillance data show a clear seasonality whereby case numbers peak during summer months in entire Europe and {{at the turn of}} the year, especially in Germany and Switzerland. A detailed description of European surveillance data by country {{at the turn of the}} year was missing so far. The objectives of the presented work were to describe national surveillance data of The European Surveillance System for 14 countries during winter times and to generate hypotheses for the observed seasonality of campylobacteriosis cases.; The analysis included 317, 986 cases notified between calendar weeks 45 and 8 of winter seasons 2006 / 2007 - 2013 / 2014. Winter peaks in weekly case notifications and notification rates were observed for Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden while for Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom no unusual increase was observed. Generally, <b>weekly</b> <b>notification</b> rates peaked in calendar week 1 or 2 after a strong decline in the last week of December and reached values of a multiple of the observed notification rates in the weeks before or after the peak e. g. up to 6. 5 notifications per 100, 000 population per week in Luxembourg. Disease onset of cases notified during winter peaks occurred predominantly in calendar weeks 52 and 1 and point towards risk exposures around Christmas and New Year. The consumption of meat fondue or table top grilling poses such a risk and is popular in many countries with an observed winter peak. Additionally, increased travel activities over the festive season could foster campylobacteriosis transmission. Surveillance artefacts (e. g. reporting delays due to public holidays) should be excluded as causes for country-specific winter peaks before investigating risk exposures...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Western {{societies}} {{there is}} a winter peak in mortality, largely accounted for by respiratory and cardiovascular deaths. In view of the known seasonal variation in vitamin D, and of the postulated link between tuberculosis and vitamin D deficiency, a study was undertaken to examine whether the presentation of tuberculosis had the same seasonal rhythm as other pulmonary infections. METHODS: Using cosinor analysis {{the presence or absence}} of seasonality was determined for 57, 313 tuberculosis notifications for England and Wales. OPCS data in four <b>weekly</b> <b>notifications</b> over a 10 year period (1983 - 92) were examined as two quinquential sets (1983 - 7 and 1988 - 92). These were compared with two groups of acute respiratory illness: 138, 992 notifications to OPCS of pneumonia deaths for 1988 - 92 and all admissions to Scottish hospitals with respiratory disease (252, 163 cases) during 1980 - 4. RESULTS: Analysis of notifications of tuberculosis revealed a summer peak with an amplitude of 10 %. This pattern differs markedly from other respiratory disorders in which a winter peak and summer trough is observed. CONCLUSIONS: The unusual seasonality of tuberculosis is currently unexplained. One possibility is that low post-winter trough levels of vitamin D (which are known to affect macrophage function and cell mediated immunity) might result in impaired cellular immunity leading, after a latent period, to reactivation of dormant mycobacterial infection...|$|R
40|$|Neiserria meningitidis {{remains an}} {{important}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} in South Africa (SA). It is the sixth commonest cause of notified disease with a case fatality rate of 11 % for the period 1990 1994. Identification of preventable risk factors is critical as no effective vaccine exists for serogroup B, the most prevalent serogroup in SA. A case control study was undertaken to determine the risk factors associated with meningococcal disease. The study population consisted of all {{children under the age of}} 14 years who were residents of the Cape Town City Council and Cape Metropolitan Council areas of jurisdiction. Cases were identified from <b>weekly</b> <b>notification</b> reports and from admissions to the City Hospital for Infectious Diseases. Controls were selected from the trauma wards at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. Data was analyzed using EPI INFO and SAS statistical software. During the period October 1993 to January 1995 70 cases and 210 controls were interviewed. Cases were significantly younger than controls (p = 0. 0001). On univariate analysis significant risk factors for meningococcal disease included: a household where 2 or more members smoked (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 8), recent upper respiratory tract infection (OR= 1. 8), poor nutritional status (OR= 3. 6), being breastfed for less than 3 months (OR= 2. 7) and overcrowding (OR= 2. 8). After adjusting for confounders, the main force of passive smoking as a risk factor for meningococcal disease appeared to be in the presence of a recent upper respiratory tract infection. Other factors that remained significant after adjusting for confounders included: being breastfed for less than three months (adjusted OR= 2. 4) and being less than 4 years old (adjusted OR= 2. 3). This is the first case control study in South Africa examining risk factors associated with meningococcal disease. The study provides further evidence for the reduction of smoking, reduction of overcrowding and the promotion of breast-feeding as important public health measures. It also identifies children under the age of 4 years as an important target group should an effective vaccine become available...|$|E
30|$|Design {{principle}} 4 b (user experience): Moderate {{interactions and}} facilitate participation through {{a set of}} mechanisms such as <b>weekly</b> email <b>notifications.</b> As illustrated in the functionality of nQuire-it and theoretically in the conception of citizen inquiry, learners define and direct their own learning through a range of tools. To support learning, scaffolding mechanisms were integrated into the design of nQuire-it, in particular to assist the process of setting up a citizen inquiry and data collection practices (Herodotou, Villasclaras-Fernandez, Sharples, 2014 b). Visual conceptual organisers represent the basic operations of science inquiry, including naming and describing a mission, setting objectives, providing guidelines on how to take part in missions, and selecting the methods of data collection using the Sense-it app, a phone camera, or text input. Future development plans include moderators or facilitators who will be in charge of engaging with participants by, for example, emailing them with platform notifications or resolving forum inquiries. Their role will be to keep participants engaged with the platform activities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The 2005 dengue {{outbreak}} in Singapore cumulated in> 14, 000 cases and 27 reported dengue deaths. We fit the single-phase Richards model to <b>weekly</b> dengue <b>notification</b> numbers {{to detect the}} turning point for the outbreak, which enables us to study the impact of intervention measures relating to the turning point. The results indicate that turning point had most likely occurred in late August or early September, before large-scale intervention measures were implemented. The “initial ” reproduction number for the outbreak {{is estimated to be}} ~ 1. 89 – 2. 23 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 15 – 3. 00). One of the lessons learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak is that multiple phases of outbreak were observed in some affected countries when efforts to intensify intervention or to sustain vigilance were compromised. Intensive and continuing efforts in the implementation of control measures are essential in reducing further dengue occurrences during any resurgence of dengue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Having been {{overwhelmed}} by {{the complexity of the}} response needed for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, public health professionals in the small island state of Barbados put various measures in place to improve its response {{in the event of a}} pandemic Methods Data for this study was collected using Barbados’ National Influenza Surveillance System, which was revitalized in 2007. It is comprised of ten sentinel sites which send <b>weekly</b> <b>notifications</b> of acute respiratory illness (ARI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to the Office of the National Epidemiologist. During the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic, meetings of the National Pandemic Planning Committee and the Technical Command Committee were convened. The pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented as a result of these meetings form the basis of the results presented in this paper. Results On June 3, 2009, Barbados reported its first case of 2009 H 1 N 1. From June until October 2009, there were 155 laboratory confirmed cases of 2009 H 1 N 1, with one additional case occurring in January 2010. For the outbreak period (June-October 2009), the surveillance team received reports of 2, 483 ARI cases, compared to 412 cases for the same period in 2008. The total hospitalization rate due to SARIs for the year 2009 was 90. 1 per 100, 000 people, as compared to 7. 3 per 100, 000 people for 2008. Barbados’ pandemic response was characterized by a strong surveillance system combining active and passive surveillance, good risk communication strategy, a strengthened public and private sector partnership, and effective regional and international collaborations. Community restriction strategies such as school and workplace closures and cancellation of group events were not utilized as public health measures to delay the spread of the virus. Some health care facilities struggled with providing adequate isolation facilities. Conclusions The number of confirmed cases was small but the significant surge in ARI and SARI cases indicate that the impact of the virus on the island was moderate. As a result of 2009 H 1 N 1, virological surveillance has improved significantly and local, regional and international partnerships have been strengthened. </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted on the effectiveness of check-in/ check-out (CICO) procedures in behavior education programs (BEPs). However, little research has been conducted on implementing CICO procedures specifically for special education students. This study examined the effects of CICO procedures on six junior high students receiving special education services. Baseline data of targeted behaviors were collected during {{the first two weeks of}} the third six weeks grading period. The participants were receiving special education services due to a previous Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee decision. CICO procedures are part of a secondary level behavior support system typically found in the BEP. The CICO procedures include a morning check-in, teacher feedback on a daily behavior report card (DBRC), an afternoon check-out, and <b>weekly</b> parent <b>notification</b> of student performance. A token economy system and behavior team meetings are two components also involved in implementing the CICO procedures. Intervention data were collected during implementation of the CICO procedures during the remaining three weeks of the third six weeks grading period. The intervention was not implemented the last week of the grading period due to final exams. The CICO procedures had high social validity ratings. Reliability, limitations and implications for future research on the current study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Interest {{in the use}} of {{emergency}} department (ED) data by syndromic surveillance systems to detect influenza outbreaks has been growing. Evaluations of these systems generally focus on events during influenza seasons. The aims of this study were to identify which emergency department disease codes best correlated with confirmed influenza cases and to determine if these same codes would be useful in the non-influenza season. The 2009 influenza pandemic in Victoria, Australia, provided further opportunity to examine the performance of the syndromic surveillance system during this event. Methods We undertook a retrospective analysis of data from the Victorian Department of Health's pilot syndromic surveillance programme, 'SynSurv'. SynSurv automatically captures patient information as it is entered by ED staff. This information includes patient demographics, their presenting symptoms and a preliminary diagnosis using ICD- 10 coding. To determine which codes were best correlated with influenza <b>notifications,</b> <b>weekly</b> counts for each of the ICD- 10 diagnosis codes ever used in the dataset were calculated and compared with the corresponding weekly count of confirmed influenza cases. Correlations between these codes and confirmed influenza cases in the non-influenza season were then undertaken. The data covered the period from July 2001 until August 2009 and included the 2009 influenza pandemic. Results There was a marked increase in weekly counts of both laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and relevant ICD- 10 codes during the influenza pandemic period. The increase in laboratory confirmed cases was more than four times greater than the previous highest number reported, in 2007, even though the influenza-like-illness activity in the community was considered comparable to 2003 and 2007. We found five ICD- 10 codes to be moderately and significantly correlated with influenza cases. None of these codes was correlated with laboratory confirmed influenza notifications outside the influenza season, at least {{in part because of the}} small number of influenza cases notified during that period. Conclusions This study suggests that the choice of codes made by ED staff to record a case of influenza-like illness is influenced by their perceptions of how much influenza is circulating at the time. The ability of syndromic surveillance to detect outbreaks early may be impeded because case diagnosis is influenced by what ED staff believes to be occurring in the community. </p...|$|R
