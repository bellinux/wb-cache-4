While praised for its architecture and lofty educational goals, attendance never met expectations. Playspace was an interactive children's museum aimed at preschool through early elementary age children. The {{move to the}} former Exploris space is the third move to a larger location in the museum's history. Playspace was originally located two blocks south of Marbles in City Market.

The non-profit museum received some funding from Wake County but was largely funded by corporate sponsorships of individual exhibits {{as well as the}} $5 per person admission price and memberships. In the summer of 2007, the two museums closed. Playspace moved into Exploris' building, and a new name for the combined museums was chosen.

40|$|Abstract Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes–LES (RANS–LES) {{methods are}} applied to a turbine blade ribbed {{internal}} duct with a 180 ° bend containing 24 pairs of ribs. Flow and heat transfer predictions are compared with experimental data and found to be in agreement. The choice of LES model {{is found to be}} of minor importance as the flow is dominated by large geometric scale structures. This is in contrast to several linear and nonlinear RANS models, which display turbulence model sensitivity. For LES, the influence of inlet turbulence is also tested and has a minor impact due to the strong turbulence generated by the ribs. Large scale turbulent motions destroy any classical boundary layer reducing near <b>wall</b> <b>grid</b> requirements. The wake-type flow structure makes this and similar flows nearly Reynolds number independent, allowing a range of flows to be studied at similar cost. Hence LES is a relatively cheap method for obtaining accurate heat transfer predictions in these types of flows. This is the accepted manuscript. The final version is available at [URL]...|$|E

These compressible formulations were developed using a dual time stepping approach with low Mach number preconditioning.

For the unstructured formulation, time marching used either an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme or traditional Gauss-Seidel scheme. All codes were parallelized to reduce the overall time required for simulations;These schemes were second-order accurate in space and time. Validations were performed using laminar and turbulent incompressible benchmark flows.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringAircraft icing is a {{recurrent}} aviation safety concern. In {{the past eight}} years alone, eight icing accidents involving business jets and other aircraft have occurred. The accumulation of ice on critical aerodynamic surfaces, the primary cause of these accidents, leads to considerable performance degradation that compromises the safety of the passengers, the crew, and the vehicle. A variety of surface-deformation and thermal systems provide icing protection for aircraft. Hot air anti-icing systems are the most common for airplanes with aluminum leading edges on wing and tail surfaces, and engine inlets. These surfaces are heated using bleed air redirected from the jet engine compressor and channeled through a piccolo tube located inside the leading edge. A series of hot air jets emanate from small holes on the piccolo tube (piccolo holes) and impinge on the internal surface of the leading edge skin, transferring heat, and increasing the skin temperature to prevent ice accumulation. The design and optimization of hot air anti-icing systems involve both experimental and numerical studies. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a cost-effective analysis tool for bleed air ice protection system design and evaluation. CFD analysis tools, however, require validation against experimental data to determine the accuracy of the numerical schemes, turbulence models, boundary conditions, and results obtained. The present thesis details a CFD methodology developed to simulate the performance of a wing hot air anti-icing system under dry air conditions (no water impingement). Computational simulations were conducted with the commercial CFD code FLUENT to investigate the performance of a hot air anti-icing system installed in the leading edge of a 72 -inch span, 60 -inch chord business jet wing model. The analysis was performed with a full-span model (FSM) and a partial-span model (PSM). The FSM was used to model {{the entire length of the}} piccolo tube to investigate the development of spanwise flow inside the piccolo tube. The PSM was used to model a 2. 44 -in spanwise section of the wing in order to investigate the internal and external flow properties about the wing with the bleed air system in operation. Computational results obtained with the PSM model were compared with experimental data obtained from icing tests performed at the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) facility. The work presented in this thesis includes extensive 2 D axisymmetric computational studies performed with a subsonic, heated, turbulent jet impinging on a flat plate to evaluate the performance of five eddy-viscosity turbulence models available in the FLUENT code. The turbulence model studies showed that the Shear Stress Transport (SST) ? -? formulation provided the most consistent prediction of recovery temperatures at the impingement <b>wall.</b> <b>Grid</b> resolution and spatial discretization studies were completed with a three-dimensional version of the jet impingement scenario employed in the turbulence study, and first- and second-order upwind schemes. Three grid resolution levels were considered based on the number of nodes distributed around the nozzle exit circumference in order to apply the same distribution around the piccolo holes circumferences in the anti-icing system PSM. A boundary condition study was performed with the anti-icing models (FSM and PSM). The PSM did not model the piccolo tube internal flow and, consequently, required inflow boundary conditions to be specified at the piccolo holes' exits. The FSM was employed to analyze the flow inside the piccolo tube and to obtain the inflow boundary conditions for the PSM. The approaches applied to extract the boundary conditions were centerline and cell-averaged. Skin temperature results from the PSM were compared with available experimental data and showed that the cell-averaged approach provided the most accurate simulation. Finally, a parametric study was conducted with the anti-icing models (FSM and PSM) to validate the computational methodology with a broad range of cases with variable internal and external flow parameters for which experimental data was available. The results for leading-edge skin temperature as well as piccolo flow properties demonstrated in all cases high-fidelity agreement with experimental data...|$|E

40|$|Several {{new methods}} have been {{developed}} to meet the critical and diversified challenges in the state-of-art unstructured-grids based high-order methods for 3 D real-world applications, including 1) parameter-free high-order generalized moment limiter for arbitrary mesh; 2) efficient line implicit method; 3) efficient quadrature-free SV method; 4) novel high-order mesh generation method for 3 D hexahedral mesh. The parameter-free high-order generalized moment limiter does not need any user-specified free parameter to detect the discontinuities and exclude the smooth extrema. The present limiter has been designed to be naturally generic, compact, and efficient, which can be applied for arbitrary mesh and general unstructured-grids based high-order methods. The present low-storage line implicit BLU-SGS method significantly overcomes the anisotropy stiffness due to highly stretched <b>wall</b> <b>grids</b> in high Reynolds number flows. Improved robustness and up to 3 times of savings on CPU time have been demonstrated comparing with the cell BLU-SGS solver. This line implicit method preserves the favorable feature of high compactness from the cell BLU-SGS method, and can be programmed as a black box so as to be easily applied in general high-order methods. The quadrature-free SV method has improved the original SV method by replacing the large number of quadrature for face integrals in 3 D case with many less nodal operations based on analytical shape functions. Finally for high-order unstructured mesh generation, the present novel and fully automatic algorithm guarantee to resolve the self-intersection problem for non-linear quadrilateral or hexahedral mesh with strong robustness. The algorithm also offers the advantage of correcting grid self-intersection without changing the basic aspect ratio of the original grids or degrading the original grid quality...|$|R
