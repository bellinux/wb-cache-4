5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day <b>with</b> <b>kids,</b> they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice.

Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{its long}} history New Rochelle has {{attracted}} an extraordinary number of prominent individuals, including preeminent authors, artists, sports stars, corporate leaders, and national trendsetters. Frederic Remington, Joseph Leyendecker and Norman Rockwell {{were joined by}} dozens of other great American artists, illustrators, cartoonists and animators who made their homes and studios in New Rochelle. Silent movies from the renowned Thanhouser Company, Mighty Mouse and other characters from Terrytoons, the Howdy Doody show, and the stories for the televised Dick Van Dyke Show all originated in New Rochelle.

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old <b>with</b> <b>kids</b> of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|Munson {{was born}} in Akron, Ohio to Darrell Vernon Munson and Ruth Myrna Smylie, the {{youngest}} of four children. His father was a World War II veteran who became a truck driver while {{his mother was a}} homemaker. When he turned eight, the Munson family moved to nearby Canton, Ohio. He was taught how to play baseball by his older brother Duane, and usually played baseball <b>with</b> <b>kids</b> Duane's age, who were four years older. His brother left to join the United States Air Force while Thurman was a freshman in high school. He attended Lehman High School in Canton, Ohio, where he was captain of the football, baseball and basketball teams and was all-city and -state in all three sports. Munson played halfback on the football squad, guard on the basketball squad, and mostly shortstop in baseball. Munson switched to catcher in his senior year in order to handle the pitching prowess of his teammate, Jerome Pruett (a fifth-round draft pick of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1965 who never reached the Major Leagues). He attracted scholarship offers from various colleges. He opted to attend nearby Kent State University on scholarship, where he was a teammate of pitcher and broadcaster Steve Stone.|$|E
