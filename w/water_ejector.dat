The <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> is normally devised in the design condition, however, it usually does not operate at the design point because the pressure and {{flow rate of water}} in <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> varies with the fluctuation of adjacent heat consumer, which causes the deviation of the indoor air temperature from the designed value. In the present study, the allowed pressure fluctuation of <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> was investigated under the condition that the indoor air temperature was maintained in a certain range. The experimental results showed that when indoor air temperature was set at °C, the allowed pressure fluctuation range for the <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> in Harbin was - 10 %∼ 20 %, and it expanded as the outdoor design temperature increased and/or the supply water temperature of primary network reduced...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was to study the possibility of applying a vacuum drying system operated by <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> pump to dry agricultural product commercially. The objective aimed to {{examine the impact of}} some variables on <b>water</b> <b>ejector</b> pump's performance and predict the best point for drying. The effect of four dependent variables, i. e. vacuum, temperature, water pressure and make-up air quantity on the moisture removal in a drying chamber was studied. The performances of a water injection vacuum drying system, the forms of moisture extraction ratio (MER) and specific moisture extraction ratio (SMER) were evaluated at the steady state (or constant drying rate) of water in a tray-dryer chamber. Four values of the vacuum in the range of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg) to atmospheric pressure (0 cmHg) combined with four values of temperature setting in the range of 40 to 70 oC, were used. The result revealed that the air temperature was the most influential effect on the MER and SMER compared to the vacuum pressure in the chamber. The vacuum pressure offered the least effect to the MER and SMER of the system. However, breeding the fresh air into the chamber while retaining the preset value of vacuum increased the MER and SMER. The MER and SMER at the chamber's temperature of 50, 60, 70 oC when compared to the values at 40 oC, were increased about 50, 120, 200 % and by 40, 100, 150 % respectively. With reference to the values of MER and SMER at the vacuum pressure of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg), it was found that at 44 kPa (- 40 cmHg) and 70 kPa (- 20 cmHg), the MER decreased by 8 and 7 % respectively. In contrary to the same reference vacuum pressure of 17 kPa (- 60 cmHg), the SMER, at 44 kPa (- 40 cmHg) and 70 kPa (- 20 cmHg) were increased by 7 and 3 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>ejectors,</b> {{as those}} {{commonly}} used in fire fighting installations, are devices which involves the mixing of two fluid circuits.

Currently, <b>water</b> <b>ejectors</b> {{are widely used}} in marine applications for ballast water treatment owing to their high suction capability and reliability. In this communication, an improved ballast treatment system employing a liquid-gas ejector is introduced to clear the ballast water to reduce environmental risks. Commonly, the liquid-gas <b>ejector</b> uses ballast <b>water</b> as the primary fluid and chemical ozone as the secondary fluid. In this study, high-pressure water and air, instead of ballast water and ozone, are considered through extensive numerical and experimental research. The ejector is particularly studied by a steady three-dimensional multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with commercial software ANSYS-CFX 14. 5. Different turbulence models (including standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, SST, and k-ω) with different grid size and bubble size are compared extensively and the experiments are carried out to validate the numerical design and optimization. This study concludes that the RNG k-ε turbulence model is the most efficient and effective for the ballast water treatment system under consideration and simple change of nozzle shape can greatly improve the ejector performance under high back pressure conditions...|$|R
50|$|Steam {{is passed}} through a vacuum ejector of high {{efficiency}} to exhaust a separate, closed vessel which forms part of a cooling water circuit. The partial vacuum in the vessel causes some of the water to evaporate, thus giving up heat through evaporative cooling.

This study aims {{to build and}} evaluate an evaporative cooling system using a <b>water</b> driven <b>ejector,</b> allowing it to be installed in places with plenty of water. The system was investigated varying the flow rate and temperature of the circulating water, temperature of the replacement water, and coefficient of performance. The best vacuum obtained was 8. 5 kPa at nominal operating conditions of 4. 1 ± 0. 1 m 3 /h and 5 ± 0. 5 °C for the circulating water reaching the temperature of 9. 7 ± 0. 5 °C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a 4 -y investigation of C- 14 in different waste streams of both boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). Due to the potential impact of C- 14 on human health, minimizing waste and releases from the nuclear power industry is of considerable interest. The experimental data and conclusions may be implemented to select appropriate waste management strategies and practices at reactor units and disposal facilities. Organic and inorganic C- 14 in spent ion exchange resins, process <b>water</b> systems, <b>ejector</b> off-gas and replaced steam generator tubes were analyzed using a recently developed extraction method. Separate analysis of the chemical species is of importance in order to model and predict the fate of C- 14 within process systems as well as in dose calculations for disposal facilities. By combining the results of this investigation with newly calculated production rates, mass balance assessments were made of the C- 14 originating from production in the coolant. Of the C- 14 formed in the coolant of BWRs, 0. 6 - 0. 8 % was found to be accumulated in the ion exchange resins (core-specific production rate in the coolant of a 2, 500 MWth BWR calculated to be 580 GB(q) GW(e) (- 1) y(- 1)). The corresponding value for PWRs was 6 - 10 % (production rate in a 2, 775 MWth PWR calculated to be 350 GBq GW(e) (- 1) y(- 1)). The C- 14 released with liquid discharges was found to be insignificant, constituting less than 0. 5 % of the production in the coolant. The stack releases, routinely measured at the power plants, were found to correspond to 60 - 155 % of the calculated coolant production, with large variations between the BWR units...|$|R
40|$|VI Abstract This Master’s thesis {{was done}} for Borealis Polymers Oy in {{co-operation}} with Chalmers University of Technology. The research concentrated on the load of petrochemical waste waters. Borealis’ Petrochemical plants consist of cracker, butadiene, benzene, cumene and phenol plants. There are two waste water systems in Borealis Polymers Petrochemical plants: phenolic waters (PW) and oily waters (OW) which were studied separately. The phenol plant discharges its waste water to both systems, while other plants discharge only to OW-system. The loads of waste waters were assessed with two methods. The first method was chemical oxygen demand and the second method {{was to assess the}} quality of waste water streams from plants. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was studied with theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) analysis. The quality of different waste water streams were assessed by taking samples from waste waters generated in the plants. In phenolic waters, the ThOD was mostly caused by methanol and phenol. In OW-system the contribution to COD-load was divided more equally between all the components found in the waste waters. Petrochemical waste waters contain a variety of different components, so ThOD analysis based only on known components did not give a full answer how different sorts of chemicals contribute to COD. On average the determined ThOD was one fifth of measured in COD in phenolic waters and one third of measured COD in oily waters. In the phenol plant the load originated from the effluent stripper and methylhydroperoxide (MHP) reactor to the phenolic waters. When the quality of waste waters was studied, the MHP-reactor was the main contributor to the load to biological treatment feed, biolsy. It is recommended that the known components should be analysed also from the outlet of the MHP-reactor continuously. The waste water from the MHP-reactor contained high concentrations of cumene and phenol. Also because of the high phenol and cumene content of the water, it should be treated either in effluent stripper or in the OW-stripper. The cracker was responsible for benzene, toluene, xylenes and phenol load to oily waters system. The phenol and aromatics were responsible for methanol, and total nitrogen load. The known components should be continuously analysed from all the main waste water sources; the diluting steam generator, the NaOH and FCC washing steps, the carbonyl wash, the OW-stripper and the <b>ejector</b> <b>waters.</b> The streams that contained high hydrocarbon concentrations should be treated in OW-stripper and streams that contained phenol should be treated in effluent stripper. The reduction of load is difficult even impossible if the reduction concentrates only on the total load, measured either from pit 27 in case of the OW-system or from the biolsy in case of phenolic waters. Firstly the variety of components in the final stream increases because waste waters from different plants are aggregated. The reduction of different kinds of components is difficult, because of different nature of components. In the final stream also the components are diluted, which also makes the reduction of components more difficult. The reduction of components can be more efficient if it is carried out at the origin of the load...|$|R
40|$|Recently, vapour {{compression}} using ejectors {{has received}} more interest from researchers in the air conditioning and refrigeration eld. Ejectors {{have the advantage of}} being extremely reliable with stable operation and no moving parts leading to essentially maintenance free operation. However, ejectors have very low eciencies and this {{can be attributed to the}} low entrained mass flow rate of the secondary stream relative to the primary stream mass ow rate. The entrainment and mixing between primary and secondary streams is therefore a dominant feature which requires investigation. This thesis introduces and demonstrates new methods to characterise the mixing process in a vapour compression ejector operated with steam as the working fluid. A new steam ejector refrigeration apparatus was built to visualise the mixing flow inside the ejector. New designs for the steam generator and the evaporator chamber were used in this apparatus. The evaporator chamber was developed in order to weigh the amount of water induced from the evaporator during the test time. The weighing method was demonstrated to be suciently accurate for this application. The highest percentage dierence between the direct weighing method and a thermal method for deducing the secondary stream mass flow rate was 2. 6 %, corresponding to about 0. 3 % of the entrainment ratio. A CFD simulation tool called Eilmer 3 (developed by the Compressible Flow CFD group of the University of Queensland) was used to simulate the flow within the axisymmetric geometry of the steam ejector. The Eilmer 3 computational simulations adopted an ideal gas model for the steam throughout the ejector. The distribution of static pressure within the ejector was accurately simulated for different primary and secondary stream conditions and different condenser pressures. The difference between experimental data and the Eilmer 3 simulations of static wall pressure was typically less than 2 %. The difference between experimental data and the Eilmer 3 simulation of entrainment ratio was 2. 9 % at 130 � primary stream temperature and 2. 6 % at 120 � primary stream temperature for choked ejector operation. For ejector operation at unckoked conditions, differences between experimental results and the simulations were substantial with the critical condenser pressure typically underestimated in the simulation by around 8. 8 % at 270 kPa primary stream pressure and 15. 4 % at 200 kPa primary stream pressure. To enable visualisation of the ejector flow, a transparent acrylic duct was optically designed using a ray tracing method. The machined and polished optical duct performed as expected in that it provided a field of view over the entire height of the duct. However, the planned schileren visualisation could not proceed with the optical duct because of shadowing effects attributed to birefringence in the duct material. Nevertheless the optical duct was successfully used to gain photographic evidence of liquid water and ice building up within the ejector. The presence of liquid and solid forms of <b>water</b> within the <b>ejector</b> suggests the ideal gas model cannot generally be applied to the steam ejector flows even though a good degree of success was achieved in modelling the static pressure distribution and entrainment ratio under choked flow conditions. A new technique for exploring the mixing region generated by the steam ejector nozzle was introduced. The new approach used a pilot tube to measure the pressure profile at different positions downstream of the nozzle exit within a mixing chamber with a relatively large rectangular cross section. A special pilot probe and traversing mechanism was designed and fabricated for this purpose. The experimental results demonstrate a shock train was established downstream of the nozzle exit. The experimental measurements indicate that pressure wave effects within the mixing jet have largely dissipated by the 70 mm downstream location. Eilmer 3 simulations were also used to investigate the flow at the nozzle exit. Eilmer 3 simulations duplicate experimental pilot pressure data at the first station downstream of the nozzle exit (1 mm) but are not consistent with the pilot pressure measurements at the other positions (25, 50, and 70 mm). A momentum integral analysis of a control volume in the mixing chamber was attempted. Using the Eilmer 3 simulation at the nozzle exit, the momentum transport into the control volume was calculated. The momentum transport out of the control volume was the estimated using experimental data at the 70 mm station based on an ideal gas analysis and an assumed constant static pressure across the jet. To reflect possible condensation effects, values for the ratio of specific heat lower than = 1. 326 were trialled in the analysis in an attempt to achieve the required momentum transport out of the control volume. However, even with = 1. 001 the momentum transport out the control volume was too high, indicating that an in flow momentum transport contribution due to recirculation across the downstream station may be significant although it was not included in the analysis. The schlieren method was used to visualize the steam flow at the exit from the nozzle inside the rectangular mixing chamber which was also used in the pilot pressure surveys. The schlieren arrangement followed Toepler's method with one lens. An edge feature of the steam jet downstream of the nozzle was detected using an image analysis process applied to the video record from the schlieren visualisation. The stagnation conditions of the steam were 380 kPa and 144 � in this case, and the background pressure in the mixing chamber was 3 kPa. ...|$|R
