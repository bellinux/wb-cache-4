Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming and Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project {{did not receive}} Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted Sharon Stone to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|C. Rudhraiya, whose former {{name was}} Aarumugam, was {{introduced}} to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared {{an interest in the}} works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> film adaptation of The Last of Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann {{had written the}} script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley will not return to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E

5|$|Sources differ widely on {{the number}} of {{children}} Amin fathered; most say that he had 30 to 45. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Idi Amin's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal Security Organisation. Another of Amin's sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected. In early 2007, the award-winning film The Last King of Scotland prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar Amin said he <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> book to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin's 40 official children by seven official wives.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success for Hammer and they quickly {{announced}} that Nigel Kneale <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> new Quatermass story for them but the script never went further than a few prelimininary discussions. Kneale did eventually write a fourth Quatermass story, broadcast as a four-part serial, titled Quatermass, by ITV television in 1979, an edited version of which was also given a limited cinema release under the title The Quatermass Conclusion. Quatermass and the Pit marked the return to directing for the cinema for Roy Ward Baker {{and he went on}} to direct such films as The Anniversary (1968), Moon Zero Two (1969), The Vampire Lovers (1970), Scars of Dracula (1970), Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971) and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974) for Hammer. He also directed Asylum (1972), And Now the Screaming Starts! (1973) and The Vault of Horror (1973) for Hammer's rival, Amicus Productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E
5|$|The New Laws {{were finally}} {{repealed}} on October 20, 1545, and riots broke out against Las Casas, with shots being fired against him by angry colonists. After a year {{he had made}} himself so unpopular among the Spaniards of the area {{that he had to}} leave. Having been summoned to a meeting among the bishops of New Spain to be held in Mexico City on January 12, 1546, he left his diocese, never to return. At the meeting, probably after lengthy reflection, and realizing that the New Laws were lost in Mexico, Las Casas presented a moderated view on the problems of confession and restitution of property, Archbishop Juan de Zumárraga of Mexico and Bishop Julián Garcés of Puebla agreed completely with his new moderate stance, Bishop Vasco de Quiroga of Michoacán had minor reservations, and Bishops Francisco Marroquín of Guatemala and Juan Lopez de Zárate of Oaxaca did not object. This resulted in a new resolution to be presented to viceroy Mendoza. His last act as Bishop of Chiapas <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> confesionario, a manual for the administration of the sacrament of confession in his diocese, still refusing absolution to unrepentant encomenderos. Las Casas appointed a vicar for his diocese and set out for Europe in December 1546, arriving in Lisbon in April 1547 and in Spain on November 1547.|$|E
