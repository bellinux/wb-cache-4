25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of things into subject/object, as <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, {{that there is no}} consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E

25|$|However <b>we</b> <b>find,</b> <b>in</b> the Blackwell {{papers in}} the National Library of Ireland that, in August 1816, by Royal Ordinance dated 24 July of that same year, Jacques Bartholomew Blackwell, Chef d’Escadron, was {{appointed}} Governor of La Petite Pierre. A document issued, in July 1819, from the Grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour, to M. Blackwell, Chef d’Escadron, Lieutenant of the King, resident in Faubourg Saint Germaine, is the last we hear of James Bartholomew Blackwell. This document confirms him as Brevet-Officer of the Royal Order of the Legion of Honour, which would bring with it a yearly payment of 20 francs. His date of death remains a mystery; at best a speculation. It is likely however that his body is interned in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Mashrab (1640-1711) — an {{influential}} Sufi poet. Boborahim Mashrab {{was born in}} 1657. He went to Qashqar and increased his knowledge under supervision of Ofoq Hoja. From 1673 {{up to the end}} of his life he lived as a tramp. In 1711 he was murdered by hokim of Balh Mahmud Taragay. In M. Namangoniy`s “ Tazkiratul-avliyo”, I. Bogistoniy`s “Tazkirai-qalandaron”, M. Samarqandiy`s “Muzakkiri – ashob”, Hakimhon`s “Muhtabat – tavorih”, M. Olim`s “Ansobus-Salotin” we may find some information about his life and works. The Russian scientists N.I. Veselovskiy, N.S. Likoshin, V.L. Vyatkin expressed important ideas about Mashrab`s creative works in 19th and 20th centuries. Also some specialists in Uzbek literature such as I. Sulton, V. Zohidov, I. Muminov, G. Gulom, A.Hayitmetov, A. Abdugafurov, E. Shodiyev, V.

25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E

500|$|This debate {{seems in}} any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were {{published}} in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem [...] "O sirene de' fiumi". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: [...] "I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> them countless examples of matchless declamation... enhanced by comparable harmonies." [...] The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue {{in the context of}} Monteverdi's artistic development: [...] "If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown".|$|E

[...] According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, [...] "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" [...] in the Battle of Alexander at Issus, and his [...] "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with Romanticism and Modern art (in particular, German Expressionism)", [...] "have been especially singled out for praise".|$|E

Tom Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell had asked Johnson to create this final major work, the Lives of the English Poets, for which he asked 200 guineas, an amount significantly less than the price he could have demanded. The Lives, which were critical as well as biographical studies, appeared as prefaces to selections of each poet's work, and they were longer and more detailed than originally expected. The work was finished in March 1781 and the whole collection was published in six volumes. As Johnson justified in the advertisement for the work, [...] "my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement, like those which <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the French Miscellanies, containing a few dates and a general character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like his libretti, Wagner's operatic scores {{generally}} {{passed through}} a series of distinct stages from sketch to fair copy; but because the composer altered his method of musical composition several times during the writing of the Ring, there is not the same uniformity {{in the evolution of the}} music that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the texts. Furthermore, it was often Wagner's practice to work on two or more drafts of a work at the same time, switching back and forth between them as the fancy took him. Consequently, it is all but impossible to make definitive statements about the exact order in which the various themes, leitmotifs and instrumentations were arrived at.

[...] Interrupted for a moment by the people, who take up the angels' words: [...] "Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus", etc., the priest goes on with the same prayer, obviously joining the next part to the beginning by the word [...] "igitur". It is not then surprising that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the oldest sacramentary that contains a Canon, the Gelasian, the heading [...] "Incipit Canon Actionis" [...] placed before the Sursum Corda; so that the preface was then still looked upon as part of the Canon.|$|E
