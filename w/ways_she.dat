She is featured along with ten other prominent Tennesseans in The Pride of Tennessee, the official Tennessee State Bicentennial Portrait which hangs in the Tennessee State Capitol. There is also a historical marker in Nashville's Centennial Park dedicated to her. Dudley was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Millicent Mehitabel Mudd, {{better known}} as Millie, is a ten-year-old red fox girl who is Ozy's best friend. Millie is usually seen wearing a set of blue denim overalls. Unlike Ozy, who is calm, Millie is chaotic and manic, both in the {{destruction}} she leaves behind and the <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> devises of avoiding work. She is a rebel and is opposed to any form of authority, which regularly leads to confrontations with both her teacher, Ms. Sorkowitz, and her mother, Mililani Mudd. Her destructive and rebellious habits not only get herself into trouble, but Ozy too.|$|E
5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} look for Simorg, the Bird of Ages, on the {{mountain}} Kaf. While wandering, he meets an old woman, Maimuna, who is a sorceress. She casts a spell upon him and he {{is sent to the}} land of Mohareb, by now an evil Sultan. However, Maimuna's sister, Khawla, knows that if Thalaba is killed that Mohareb would also be killed and she seeks to kill Thalaba to remove Mohareb. Finding this out, Mohareb joins with Thalaba and returns the ring. After telling Thalaba to turn to the darker powers, Thalaba leaves. Khawla attempts to user her magic to kill Thalaba, but the ring protects him. When Maimuna tries to user her own magic against Thalaba, she witnesses the goodness of the universe and represents her evil <b>ways.</b> <b>She</b> repays him by using her magic to bring him back to the mountain, and Thalaba is able to return to his search for Simorg. After wandering through snow, Thalaba comes across the Font of Fire with the sleeping Laila trapped inside. It turns out she was placed there by her father, the sorcerer Okba and one of the murderers of Thalaba's family.|$|E

500|$|Jackson owed his vocal {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> moved. She was art in motion. I studied the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> moved, the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> sang – just the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was." [...] He told her: [...] "I want to be just like you, Diana."

Given that {{the running of}} a Tor exit node is an unsettled area of Canadian law, and that in general institutions are more capable than individuals to cope with legal pressures, Alison Macrina of the Library Freedom Project has opined that in some <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> {{would like to see}} intelligence agencies and law enforcement attempt to intervene in the event that an exit node were established.|$|E
25|$|The Empress's faction lacked an {{equivalent}} war leader to Stephen. Matilda had a firm grounding in government from her time as empress, {{where she had}} presided in court cases and acted as regent in Italy with the Imperial army on campaign. Nonetheless, Matilda, as a woman, could not personally lead forces into battle. Matilda was less popular with contemporary chroniclers than Stephen; in many <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> took after her father, being prepared to loudly demand compliance of her court, when necessary issuing threats and generally appearing arrogant. This was felt to be particularly inappropriate {{since she was a}} woman. Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, {{played an important role in}} seizing Normandy during the war but did not cross into England. Geoffrey and Matilda's marriage was not an easy one; it had almost collapsed altogether in 1130.|$|E

25|$|According to Wilder, {{he asked}} George Cukor for advice, and he {{suggested}} Swanson, {{one of the}} most feted actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent and extravagant lifestyle. At the peak of her career in 1925, she was said to have received 10,000 fan letters in a single week, and from 1920 until the early 1930s she lived on Sunset Boulevard in an elaborate Italianate palace. In many <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> resembled the Norma Desmond character and, like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into talking pictures. The similarities ended there. Swanson accepted the end of her film career and in the early 1930s moved to New York City, where she worked in radio and, from the mid-1940s, in television and on the New York stage. Though Swanson was not seeking a comeback, she was intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.|$|E
25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production of that story, leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many <b>ways,</b> <b>she</b> might be claimed to be the companion most like her Doctor (if Romana I were not more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E
25|$|To {{address these}} issues, Grampus, {{although}} similar in design {{to the traditional}} New England schooner, also differed in significant <b>ways.</b> <b>She</b> had a hull about two feet (0.6 meter) deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability. She had a straight stem, rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed {{so that she could}} carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore staysail running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas.|$|E

25|$|Mrs. Logan {{immediately}} identified her {{interests with}} those {{of her husband and}} in many <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> contributed to his many successes in the political world. She accompanied him on all his professional journeys, an undertaking in those days of wildernesses and no roads, often requiring great endurance and privation. A son, John Cunningham Logan, was born in 1856 but died the following year. Also in 1856, Mrs. Logan saw her husband elected a member of the Legislature, and in the Douglas and Lincoln Senatorial contest, he was elected as a Douglas Democrat to Congress. In all the political campaigns, the wife went with her husband, assisting in much of his Work of correspondence and copying, and frequently receiving his friends and conferring with them on the details of the campaign. When Mr. Logan came to Congress as a Representative, Mrs. Logan came with him. She remained with him in Washington until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he resigned his seat in Congress to return to Illinois to go into the service of his country.|$|E
