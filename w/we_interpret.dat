2500|$|The poem is {{generally}} more valued by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric {{though it is}} not a choral song but a solo performance.

Another scholar saw parallels between it and Anacreon's Artemon but judged Anacreon's poem to have more grace and wit. However, scholarly analysis of the poem has not produced agreement or convincing results and much depends on how <b>we</b> <b>interpret</b> the poet's tone.
