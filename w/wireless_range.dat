25|$|Download Play {{allows users}} to play local {{multiplayer}} games with other Nintendo 3DS systems using only one Game Card. Players must have their systems within <b>wireless</b> <b>range</b> (up to approximately 65 feet) of {{each other for the}} guest system to download the necessary data from the host system. Download Play on Nintendo 3DS systems is also backward compatible, meaning that it is also available for Nintendo DS games. Unlike Download Play on Nintendo DS, game data, once downloaded to the guest system, is stored on the system's SD card, no longer requiring a re-download for a future game session. Nintendo 3DS games can only transfer a maximum of 32MB of data to other systems while in download play. Other forms of local multiplayer modes require each player to own the software that is currently being used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{consist of}} a large number of sensor nodes which are deployed without self-defense capability. The node replication attack is a specific attack mode to WSN and the detection of node replication attacks in WSNs became a fundamental problem. In this paper, we proposed a range-assisted distributed protocol (RADP) to detect node replication attacks in WSNs. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we showed that the known solutions do not completely meet our requirements. Second, we tried to use <b>wireless</b> <b>ranging</b> information to detect node replication attacks. Third, we proposed a novel protocol for the detection of node replication attacks and Extensive theoretical analysis and experiment verified that it can maintain a high detection probability with low accuracy ranging among nodes.
