40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1987 A {{breeding}} bird census and quantitative vegetation {{analysis was conducted}} in 1981 and 1982 on Douglas-fir/hardwood forest at the Northern California Coast Range Preserve in Mendocino County, California at sites representing an old-growth stand, a stand moderately logged in 1950 and a stand heavily logged in 1956. A select group of discriminating variables that best described the structure and floristic composition were very successful in distinguishing the three sites. The highest total volume of young hardwoods and conifers (DBH 10. 2 - 12. 6 cm) and highest volume of tanoak (DBH 27. 9 - 91. 3 cm) characterized the heavily logged site. The highest volume of madrone (DBH 12. 7 - 27. 8 cm) and greatest abundance of total hardwoods {{was found in the}} moderately logged site. The highest percentage canopy closure, large conifers (DBH> 91. 4 cm) and volume of Douglas-fir (DBH 53. 3 - 91. 3 cm) and lowest percentage ground cover of dead and down woody material-type 1, distinguished the old-growth site. The number of bird species reported breeding for all three sites in 1981 and 1982 were 34 and 29 respectively. There {{was no significant difference between}} sites and years in the number of breeding species and individuals and the evenness and diversity indices of the {{breeding bird}} populations. There was a strong positive correlation (r= 0. 95) between the number of large snags (> 27. 8 cm) and the number of territories of cavity nesters present on the three sites. The <b>Western</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> Wilson's Warbler, and Chestnut-Backed Chickadee were the most common breeding species of the three sites and were included in a group of broad spectrum species that accounted for 47 percent of all breeding territories recorded. Breeding bird species associated with hardwoods, including the most common Black-Headed Grosbeak and Warbling Vireo, accounted for 42 percent of all breeding territories recorded. Of the four bird species associated with old-growth forest, the Spotted Owl would be considered an obligate old-growth species...|$|E

50|$|Burrough Valley is habitat to {{many animals}} and birds, {{including}} black-tailed deer, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, cottontail, gray squirrel, California ground squirrel, and many smaller rodents. Wild pigs were introduced or {{migrated to the}} area in the 1980s. Feral pigs, which escaped from early settlers, were once common in the 1900s and early 20th century. Reptiles inhabiting the area include the northern Pacific rattlesnake, gopher snake, two species of king snake, garter snake, northern alligator lizard, western fence lizard, skink, and whiptail lizard. The area’s amphibians include the tree frog, California newt, several species of salamander, toad, and American bull frog, which was introduced in the 19th century. The foothill yellow-legged frog once was common, but is now rare. Golden eagles occasionally soar high above the valley and make their nests in the remote rocky crags on the mountain tops. Red-tailed hawks often ride afternoon thermals. There are also Cooper’s hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins and kestrels. Turkey vultures spend most {{of the year in the}} area but migrate south in winter. Crows are common. Other birds include meadow larks, mourning doves, starlings, scrub jays, Steller’s jays, blackbirds, sparrows, towhees, western bluebirds, Wilson’s warblers, <b>western</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> titmice, humming birds, and many other small birds. Wild turkeys, introduced in the 1960s, are common. Band-tailed pigeons enter the valley in the fall and winter to feast on acorns. The commonest bird is perhaps the acorn woodpecker, whose raucous laugh can be heard nearly every daytime moment. Several other species of woodpeckers are found, including the red-shafted flicker, Lewis's woodpecker and downy woodpecker. California valley quail are also common, with their call “chi-ca-GO! chi-chi-ca-GO!” heard frequently.|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} major driving forces for {{adaptive}} shifts in migration and breeding phenology and possibly impacts demographic changes if a species fails to adapt sufficiently. In <b>Western</b> Europe, pied <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula hypoleuca) have insufficiently adapted their breeding phenology to the ongoing advance of food peaks within their breeding area and consequently suffered local population declines. We address the question whether this population decline led to a loss of genetic variation, using two neutral marker sets (mitochondrial control region and microsatellites), and one potentially selectively non-neutral marker (avian Clock gene). We report temporal changes in genetic diversity in extant populations and biological archives over more than a century, using samples from sites differing in the extent of climate change. Comparing genetic differentiation over this period revealed that only the recent Dutch population, which underwent population declines, showed slightly lower genetic variation than the historic Dutch population. As that loss of variation was only moderate and not observed in all markers, current gene flow across Western and Central European populations might have compensated local loss of variation over the last decades. A comparison of genetic differentiation in neutral loci versus the Clock gene locus provided evidence for stabilizing selection. Furthermore, in all genetic markers, we found a greater genetic differentiation in space than in time. This pattern suggests that local adaptation or historic processes might have a stronger effect on the population structure and genetic variation in the pied flycatcher than recent global climate changes. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{fall was}} notable for {{its lack of}} notable events; numbers of {{migrants}} reported in all species groups, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and warblers, were low. Lingering birds were both insectivores and seed-eaters, and, coupled with a rather stable fall weather-wise, {{it seems that there}} were no disturbances to concentrate birds or otherwise impede a steady flow of migrants through the state. Without concentrations, migrants are often not noticed or, more accurately here, not reported by observers. The best Western Grebe count was 2500, very low relative to expected high fall counts of at least 20, 000. Mergansers were the only bright spot in waterfowl numbers, although they were present only in average numbers, rather than low numbers as were most of the other waterfowl. Among warblers, the few highlights included more reports than usual of Black-throated Green, as well as a lengthy migration period, both indicators of more birds being present. Other migrant species, however, were represented by 1 – 2 or even no reports.

40|$|Analyses of {{long-term}} {{data indicate that}} human-caused climatic changes are affecting bird phenology in directions consistent with theoretical predictions. Here, we report on recent trends in the timing of spring arrival and egg laying found within a <b>western</b> European Pied <b>Flycatcher</b> Ficedula hypoleuca population. Mean egg laying date has advanced over the past 20 years in this population. The advancement in egg laying date was stronger than the advancement of spring arrival, suggesting that Pied Flycatchers are changing these stages of their annual cycle at different rates. It could be shown that selection for earlier breeding had increased. Hence, the observed adjustment in laying date did not match the advancement of spring. Our findings raise general questions about the adaptability of migratory birds to rapid environmental changes. Adaptive advancement of reproduction in response to increasing spring temperatures and to the concomitant advancement of food supply could be held back, because annual breeding and migration cycles are controlled primarily by endogenous rhythms and photoperiodic cues which do not relate to temperature. Migrants may have several options for arriving earlier on the breeding grounds, including an increase in migration speed, earlier departure from the wintering area or a shortening of migration distance. Changes in migratory behaviour could be accomplished either by phenotypic plasticity or by selection on different genotypes. Although descriptive field data provide compelling evidence for changes in, and possible constraints on, the timing of breeding and migration, their explanatory power in predicting the limits of adaptation remains restricted. We review recent experimental approaches, which explicitly test the relative roles of genetic versus environmental factors in the adaptation of life-cycle timing to global environmental changes [KEYWORDS: Ficedula hypoleuca, biological rhythms, climate change, migration, moult, photoperiod, reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Ninety-one {{species of}} birds were {{surveyed}} in grass/forb, early and late shrub/sapling, pole, and medium sawtimber stages of young-growth Douglas-fir in northwestern California; patterns of bird distribution and abundance were related to habitat conditions and even-age silvicultural treatments. Seven species (band-tailed pigeon, western wood pewee, dusky <b>flycatcher,</b> <b>western</b> bluebird, fox sparrow, purple finch, and evening grosbeak) have probably increased in population size or distribution since extensive clearcutting {{in the study area}} began in the early 1950 's. Six species (Hammond's flycatcher, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet, and hermit warbler) are restricted to forest stages and probably have decreased in population size or distribution. Abundances of various species were associated with presence of a forest overstory, hardwood stem density, deciduous foliage volume, height and patchiness of shrub cover, number plant species, and snag density. Slope angle and distance to permanent water or to the next nearest similar habitat type explained some variation in abundance of a few species. The grass/forb stage had the lowest number of bird species and lowest total density, while the late shrub/sapling stage had the highest; species composition varied markedly across the young-growth stages. Cluster analysis defined Shrub stage specialists and forest stage Specialists. Seasonal patterns of permanent resident species suggested that the shrub stage specialists are most limited in distribution during winter, and that their winter distributions may reflect optimal ("source") habitat. In contrast, forest stage specialists showed no seasonal changes of distribution, or were more restricted in distribution during the breeding season. All phases of the clearcutting system, including site preparation, stocking control, intermediate treatments, and final harvest, greatly affect stand conditions. No one stand condition, young-growth stage, or silvicultural treatment provided best habitat for all bird species. Simplification of forest stand structure by reduction or elimination of hardwoods, snags, and large diameter softwoods, could lead to low within-stand but high between-stand diversity of vegetation and bird assemblages. Even-age silvicultural systems, however, can integrate management objectives for timber production and bird habitat...|$|R
