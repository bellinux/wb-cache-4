25|$|Research by {{historian}} Paul Finkelman {{reveals that}} Marshall owned hundreds of slaves, {{contrary to the}} conventional belief that he owned only {{a dozen or so}} slaves. Marshall also engaged in the buying and selling of slaves throughout his life. As the then Ariel F.

Finkelman's research <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>published</b> <b>in</b> his forthcoming book, Supreme Injustice: Slavery in the Nation’s Highest Court, to be published by the Harvard University Press. Finkelman suggests that Marshall's substantial slave holdings may have influenced him to render judicial decisions in favor of slave owners.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>published</b> <b>in</b> 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
