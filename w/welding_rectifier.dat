40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the leakage control and quality {{assurance}} of fabrication pressure vessels for water heating. A relevant welding device and process are described. MAG welding including the equipment for welding water-heater shell,the power source using a <b>welding</b> <b>rectifier</b> with a horizontal static characteristic and measuring welding current and arc voltage during welding are schematic represented. There are shown defects, which are most often occurred at the junctions between the longitudinal and circumferential welds and at the contact between the start {{and end of the}} circumferential weld. One part of the paper describes, how to improve the fabrication of pressure vessels for water heating by welding. Spatter free ignition (SFI) of the welding arc by MAG welding is described. Finally, a leak tightness testing of welds is represented...|$|E

The production program of the company covers more than 25 welding products - <b>welding</b> transformers, <b>welding</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> Argon- arc <b>welding,</b> Burners and burners mini kit, Oxygen cutting torches and Set burners and oxygen cutting torch.|$|R
50|$|A {{direct current}} power source (generator or rectifier) having {{drooping}} characteristics and {{open circuit voltage}} of 70 volts or above is suitable for plasma arc <b>welding.</b> <b>Rectifiers</b> are generally preferred over DC generators. Working with helium as an inert gas needs open circuit voltage above 70 volts. This higher voltage {{can be obtained by}} series operation of two power sources; or the arc can be initiated with argon at normal open circuit voltage and then helium can be switched on.|$|R
