40|$|ABSTRACT One {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of excess DL-methionine (DLM) and DL- 2 -hy-droxy- 4 -methylthiobutanoic acid free acid (DL-HMB-FA) on duck growth. One-day-old male white Pekin ducklings were fed common starter diets from hatch to 21 d of age and then fed the experimental diets from 21 to 42 d of age. Three hundred twenty 21 -d-old birds were allotted to 40 raised <b>wire-floor</b> pens with 8 birds per pen according to similar pen weight. There were 5 dietary treatments that included a methionine-adequate control diet and con-trol diets supplemented with 2 levels of dry DLM (1 or 2 %) or 2 equimolar levels of liquid DL-HMB-FA (1. 13 or 2. 26 %). Each dietary treatment was replicated 8 times. At 42 d of age, weight gain, feed intake, and gain/feed were measured and plasma was collected to analyze homocys-teine. Compared with ducks fed control diets, excess DL...|$|E
40|$|T) REVIOUS {{studies on}} the daily pat-•* • tern of lay of turkeys in floor pens indi-cate a large {{percentage}} of eggs are laid during the afternoon hours (Stockton and Asmundson, 1950; Kosin and Abplanalp, 1951). The latter authors found that the time interval between successive oviposi-tions decreased with increase in size of egg sequence. They further reported that time of day when egg sequences are initi-ated is a good indicator of the laying pat-tern of the hen, since long-sequence layers usually begin their egg sequences early in the morning hours of the day. The usual method of timing oviposi-tions, as reported in the literature, con-sists of checking the trapnests hourly dur-ing the light hours of the work day. No reference is made to ovipositions that may have occurred prior to or after the light period. Since continuous-recording timing devices are now available (Wilson, 1962), time of lay over the entire 24 -hour period can be determined. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the daily time of lay over the 24 -hour period of the day for turkey hens kept in individual <b>wire-floor</b> cages, and 2) to measure with greater accuracy the time lapse between successive eggs in se-quences...|$|E
40|$|A {{dose-response}} {{experiment with}} seven supplemental pyridoxine levels (0, 0. 66, 1. 32, 1. 98, 2. 64, 3. 30, and 3. 96 mg/kg) {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of pyridoxine on growth performance and plasma aminotransferases and homocysteine of White Pekin ducks and to estimate pyridoxine requirement for these birds. A total of 336 one-day-old male White Pekin ducks were divided to 7 experimental treatments and each treatment contained 8 replicate pens with 6 birds per pen. Ducks were reared in raised <b>wire-floor</b> pens from hatch to 28 d of age. At 28 d of age, the weight gain, feed intake, feed/gain, and the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and homocysteine in plasma of ducks from each pen were all measured. In our study, the pyridoxine deficiency of ducks was characterized by growth depression, decreasing plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity and increasing plasma homocysteine. The ducks fed vitamin B 6 -deficient basal diets had the worst weight gain and feed/gain among all birds and this growth depression was alleviated (p< 0. 05) when pyridoxine was supplemented to basal diets. On the other hand, plasma aspartate aminotransferase and homocysteine may be the sensitive indicators for vitamin B 6 status of ducks. The ducks fed basal diets had much lower aspartate aminotransferase activity and higher homocysteine level in plasma compared with other birds fed pyridoxine-supplemented diets (p< 0. 05). According to quadratic regression, the supplemental pyridoxine requirements of Pekin ducks from hatch to 28 days of age was 2. 44 mg/kg for feed/gain and 2. 08 mg/kg for plasma aspartate aminotransferase and the corresponding total requirements of this vitamin for these two criteria were 4. 37 and 4. 01 mg/kg when the pyridoxine concentration of basal diets was included, respectively. All data suggested that pyridoxine deficiency could cause growth retardation in ducks and the deficiency of this vitamin could be indicated by decreasing plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity and increasing plasma homocysteine...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{trials of}} {{identical}} experimental design {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of temperature, dietary Lys level, and dietary Arg:Lys ratios on performance and carcass yield of male broilers. Birds of a commercial strain were grown from 21 to 42 d of age in <b>wire-floored</b> finishing batteries placed in environmental chambers. The chambers were programmed to provide either a constant thermoneutral temperature (21. 1 C), a constant cold temperature (15. 5 C), or a cycling hot diurnal temperature (25. 5 to 33. 3 C). Within each environment there was a factorial arrange-ment of three Lys levels (1. 0, 1. 1, and 1. 2 %) with four Arg:Lys ratios (1. 1 : 1, 1. 2 : 1, 1. 3 : 1, and 1. 4 : 1).

40|$|THE use of DDT, 2, 2 -bis(p-chloro-phenyl) 1, 1, 1 -trichJoroethane, on tur-key {{farms to}} control houseflies and other insects {{is likely to}} become widespread.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} as a completely randomized design, with a factorial arrangement to determine the response of commercial broilers to choice feeding and limiting amino acids on growth and carcass performance. A total of 432 male birds were weighed at one-d-old and randomly distributed to 48 <b>wire-floored</b> brooder cage each 1. 0 m 2. There were 2 sexes and 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicates each of 9 birds. Birds were given one of three dietary regimens with dietary change every 7 days. All groups were fed free choice of summit and dilution diets. The estimated dietary level of crude protein at day-old was 240 g/kg and the level at 42 d was either 120, 150 or 180 g/kg for females or 130, 160 and 190 g/kg for males. At 43 d of age, all birds from each dietary treatment were slaughtered for measurement of body composition. Results reveal that lysine requirement for maximum gain {{in this study was}} higher than NRC recommendation. The free choice-fed bird was significantly higher, in terms of growth and body composition than that obtained on the low dietary protein regimen. Keywor...|$|R
40|$|The {{date palm}} (Phoenix dactylifera) seeds were {{utilized}} in some traditional medical remedies {{and have been}} investigated for their possible health benefits. This proposed study wanted to assess the effect of date palm seeds (DPS) dietary supplementation in comparison to mannan-oligosaccharides (Bio-Mos®) and β-glucan over antioxidant and immunity events that have effect on growth and carcass performances of broilers. An aggregate of 180, one-day-old, chicks were raised in the <b>wire-floored</b> cages and allotted into control, Bio-Mos (0. 1 %[*][*]Bio-Mos), β-glucan (0. 1 %[*][*]β-glucan), DPS 2 (2 % date crushed seeds), DPS 4 (4 % date crushed seeds), and DPS 6 (6 % date crushed seeds) groups. Broilers in DPS 2 and DPS 4 groups showed significant variations (P< 0. 05) in relative growth rate (RGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and efficiency of energy utilization in comparison to control group. Moreover, all DPS fed groups showed significant increases (P< 0. 05) in serum reduced glutathione (GSH) values. Meanwhile, both serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in DPS 2. Consequently, obtained data revealed a substantial enhancement of performance, immunity, and antioxidant status by DPS supplementation in broiler that {{might be related to}} the antioxidant and immune-stimulant constituents of P. dactylifera seeds...|$|R
40|$|One {{experiment}} in <b>wire-floored</b> batteries and two experiments in litter-floor pens {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of addition of alpha-galactosidase enzyme to typical corn-soybean meal based diets for broilers. In two experiments, Avizyme 1502 was fed {{in conjunction with the}} alpha-galactosidase enzyme. In formulating test diets, soybean meal was assigned an ME value beginning at 2440 ME kcal/kg and increased {{on the assumption that the}} addition of the enzyme would increase the ME of soybean meal by 10, 20, or 30 %. In two experiments, the level of supplemental poultry oil remained constant with increases in apparent ME, while in the third the level of supplemental poultry oil was reduced as the assumed ME level of soybean meal was increased. Male chicks of a commercial broiler strain were used in all experiments. Overall, the results of the three experiments suggest little if any improvement in metabolizable energy of SBM as a result of the addition of an exogenous alpha-galactosidase enzyme, as indicated by evaluation of body weight gain, feed utilization, calorie conversion, or mortality. No improvements in the above parameters were noted when Avizyme 1502 was added to the diet, alone or in combination with the alpha-galactosidase enzyme. At the present time, it does not appear that diets based on corn and SBM of average quality would benefit from supplementation with these enzymes...|$|R
40|$|THE {{possibility}} of an increased vita-min A requirement at elevated tem-peratures {{is not only a}} point of theoretical interest, but also of practical value for more efficient breeding of birds in hot countries. Mills et al. (1947) showed that thiamine requirement increases at 91 °F. to approxi-mately 3 times normal. Kurokawa (1941 a) found that vitamin A deficiency can be in-duced in rats more speedily at high tem-perature and that vitamin A deficiency markedly shortens the time to reach lethal heat exhaustion in rabbits exposed to high temperature (Kurokawa, 1941 b). Heat and solar radiation increased loss of liver vita-min A in the bovine (Page et al., 19 S 9). Similarly White Leghorn pullets showed greater vitamin A storage during winter (Kurnick et al., 1961). In the present work the influence of moderately elevated temperature on the vitamin A requirement of chicks has been studied. All the usual criteria of vitamin A activity (growth, plasma level, liver stor-age and survival) have been investigated in chicks grown at different temperatures. EXPERIMENTAL A 2 X 3 factorial experiment was carried out to test the influence of 2 temperatures and 3 vitamin levels, namely 75, 150 and 300 I. U. / 100 g. diet. Four hundred S. C. White Leghorn male chicks were grown in electrically-heated <b>wire-floored</b> batteries. They were first put on a depletion diet (Ascarelli and Senger, 1962) for two weeks so {{that at the end of}} this period their liver reserves of vitamin A were no more than 10 - 20 I. U. /liver.

At 14 d of age excreta samples were collected, frozen, freeze dried, and analyzed for total P (TP), Ca, and water-soluble P (WSP). The ratio of WSP/TP was calculated from these data. The TP, Ca and WSP in excreta increased as the NPP content of the diet increased. Phytase supplementation reduced TP and Ca but increased WSP concentration and the WSP/TP ratio; this effect might be reversed if levels of NPP lower than those evaluated in the present study are utilized to account for the improvement on phytate phosphorus digestion. The addition of Hy-D reduced TP and Ca concentration in broiler excreta. The most remarkable effect was seen by increasing dietary calcium levels above the 2 : 1 Ca:NPP ratio typically used in the poultry industry. As the dietary Ca increased, there were significantly reduced excreta levels of TP, WSP and the WSP/TP ratio was significantly reduced.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intestinal}} microbiota and dietary supplementation of mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) on mucosal architecture and digestive physiology in broiler chicks was examined. In experiment 1, pre-sterilized eggs (Ross x Ross 308) {{were placed in}} three HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) -filtered isolator units at day 19 of incubation. Germ-free chicks in one isolator were conventionalized by exposure to cecal contents from a laying hen. Bacterial contamination occurred in one germ-free isolator such that these birds were monoassociated by a bacterium within the Acinetobacter spp. resulting in 3 categories of microbial status including germ-free (GF, n= 10), conventionalized (CV, n= 19) and monoassociated (Mono, n= 13) birds. Dietary treatments assigned to each isolator consisted of a negative control (NC, 0 g/kg of MOS in the basal diet) and MOS (2 g/kg of MOS in the diet) resulting in a 2 X 3 factorial treatment arrangement. At 7 d of age, body weight was recorded and birds were killed to permit collection of visceral organs, intestinal tissues and cecal contents. Body weight, relative length of small intestinal segments and relative bursa weight were significantly increased in CV birds. These birds also had increased crypt depth and lamina propria area. Dietary MOS increased villus height and villus surface area in CV birds compared with GF and Mono birds. Transcripts for all housekeeping genes tested in ileal tissue were increased by MOS such that transcripts were normalized to unit mass of total RNA. In comparison to birds fed the NC diet, MOS significantly increased the abundance of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), toll-like receptor (TLR) - 4, avian β-defensin (GAL) - 6, interleukin (IL) - 8, peptide transporter 1 (PepT 1) and sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) - 1 transcripts in ileum per unit total RNA. However, the effect of microbial status on selected gene expression profiles was surprisingly limited. A second experiment was conducted to confirm the conventionalization protocol produced a complex microbiota similar to conventionally reared birds. Twenty day-old broiler chicks (Ross x Ross 308) were {{assigned to one of}} two <b>wire-floored</b> battery cages provided the NC and MOS diets ad libitum and killed at 7 d of age. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis demonstrated that microbial diversity indices (Richness, Evenness, Shannon, and Simpson) were greater in conventionalized gnotobiotic birds compared to the conventionally reared birds confirming a successful conventionalization strategy in the gnotobiotic trial. These studies demonstrate that under good hygienic conditions, CV chicks thrive similar to GF animals. Based on responses to MOS observed in GF birds, evidence indicates that MOS, independent of changes in microbial composition, directly modifies host response parameters including innate immune activation, digestive and absorptive function...|$|R
