5|$|Considered by itself, Artemisium <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> {{insignificant}} battle. The Allies did not {{defeat the}} Persian navy, nor {{prevent it from}} advancing further {{along the coast of}} Greece. Conversely, neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet, nor irreparably weaken it. The battle was thus an indecisive one, which pleased neither side.|$|E
5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived {{in a community of}} 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of the}} book, 1941–1943, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E

Roche also took the team's best placing at the fall monument, the Giro di Lombardia, but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> distant 16th on the day.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> large village. The influx of Palestinian refugees from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.) Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E
5|$|According to Eastern Han-era sources, the Northern Army <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> small {{fighting}} force of between 3,500 and 4,200 professional soldiers, each regiment consisting of approximately 750 soldiers and 150 junior officers. To aid this force, Emperor Guangwu established a 1,000-soldier unit of army reserves in Liyang County along the Yellow River in 43 AD, while two other reserve units {{were created in}} 110 AD; these were headed by a Commandant (the same title used for the commandery-level military officer). The main purpose of these reserve units was to position Han troops at strategic passes to guard the lower Wei River against Xiongnu, Wuhuan, and Tibetan tribes.|$|E

5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist {{and front}} {{section of the}} centipede. Having already acted in or written {{for a number of}} films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused to the surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

5|$|Design work on Kaiserin Augusta {{began in}} 1887; {{budgetary}} restrictions forced the German Navy {{to design a}} ship that could serve in both colonial and fleet scout roles. During the design process, it was determined a three-shaft arrangement of the machinery {{would be necessary to}} attain the high speed requirement. This resulted in the first warship of the German Navy to use three screws. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> novel development; at the time of Kaiserin Augustas construction, only a handful of French and American ships had experimented with the arrangement, and had not yet been to sea for a thorough evaluation of the design. Kaiserin Augusta was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1890. She was launched on 15 January 1892 and commissioned into the fleet {{less than a year later}} on 17 November 1892.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by about the age of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E
5|$|In Yugoslavia, Meyszner was {{no longer}} able to access his pension and had few assets, and worked as the {{cultural}} policy chief of the centre for Nazi fugitives. He travelled to Germany by sea in November 1934. He first went to the camp for Nazi fugitives at Rummelsburg in Pomerania, before transferring to a similar facility in Berlin. Once in Germany, he submitted his résumé to the Allgemeine SS. At the time, the Allgemeine SS <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> new paramilitary arm of the German Nazi Party that was overtaking the SA in importance. In his résumé, he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills.|$|E

5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob area <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> flat basin near {{sea level}} {{on the western}} margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from {{surrounding}} mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{attaining}} typhoon intensity, Kirogi began to undergo rapid intensification. Roughly 18hours later, the JTWC {{reported that the}} storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 215km/h (135mph 1-minute sustained), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. By this time, the typhoon was situated roughly 870km (540mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm featured a 59km (37mi) wide symmetrical eye. Early on July5, the JMA reported that Kirogi attained its peak intensity with winds of 155km/h (100mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 940mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). The storm <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> large typhoon, with a gale diameter of 520km (325mi).|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{exceptions}} were made; Israel and Egypt {{could buy}} advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements, Israel was {{even allowed to}} buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, a key component in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets. South Korea's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed {{in the context of}} strengthening relations. Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs, however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> {{new kind of}} bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E
5|$|Paltrow's guest {{appearance}} attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots {{were less}} well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode {{one of the}} best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> subdued, mediocre episode, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found it to be an improvement on the previous two episodes, if not genuinely good. The National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder.
