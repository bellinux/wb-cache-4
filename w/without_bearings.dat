When she talked and wished to insist, and she was always insisting, she puckered and distorted her face, with an effort to express the inexpressible, which turned out, after all, to be nothing. She {{had a kind of}} doleful elegance, tried to be confidential, lowered her voice and looked as if she wished to establish a secret understanding, in order to ask her visitor if she would venture on an apple-fritter. She wore a flowing mantle, which resembled her husband's waterproof--a garment which, when she turned to her daughter or talked about her, might have passed for the robe of a sort of priestess of maternity. She endeavoured to keep the conversation in a channel which would enable her to ask sudden incoherent questions of Olive, mainly as to whether she knew the principal ladies (the expression was Mrs. Tarrant's), not only in Boston, but in the other cities which, in her nomadic course, she herself had visited. Olive knew some of them, and of some of them had never heard; but she was irritated, and pretended a universal ignorance (she was conscious that she had never told so many fibs), by which her hostess was much disconcerted, although her questions had apparently been questions pure and simple, leading nowhither and <b>without</b> <b>bearings</b> on any new truth.|$|E

40|$|Integral Abutment Bridges (IABs) are {{jointless}} structures <b>without</b> <b>bearings</b> or expansion joints, {{which require}} minimum or zero maintenance. The {{barrier to the}} application of longspan IABs is {{the interaction of the}} abutment with the backfill soil during the thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge deck, i. e. serviceability, or when the bridge is subjected to dynamic loads, such as earthquakes. The interaction of the bridge with the backfill leads to settlements and ratcheting of the soil behind the abutment and, as a result, the soil pressures acting on the abutment build-up in the long-term. This paper provides a solution for the aforementioned challenges, by introducing a novel isolator that is a compressible inclusion (CI) of reused tyre derived aggregates (TDA) placed between the bridge abutment and the backfill. The compressibility of typical tyre derived aggregates was measured by laboratory tests and the compressible inclusion was designed accordingly. The CI was then applied to a typical integral frame abutment model, which was subjected to static and dynamic loads representing in-service and seismic loads correspondingly. The response of both the conventional and the isolated abutment was assessed based on the settlements of the backfill, the soil pressures and the actions of the abutment. The study of the isolated abutment showed that the achieved decoupling of the abutment from the backfill soil results in significant reductions of the settlements of the backfill and of the pressures acting on the abutment. Hence, the proposed research can be of use for extending the length limits of integral frame bridges subjected to earthquake excitation...|$|E

Because this components can be applied universally, the use of CMC materials will be increased and their application is not only restricted to the design of hot structures for space vehicles.

An extensive literature and market survey indicated that composite materials are increasingly being considered for use in civil infrastructure applications ranging from the retrofit and rehabilitation of buildings and bridges to the construction of new structural systems. Very little research has been conducted on FRPs as piling materials. The current research investigates the use of fiber reinforced composites as piling materials for jointless bridges. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed and analyzed using the multi purpose FEM package ANSYS. The models were built to take into consideration multiple design parameters including the non-linear behavior of soil and concrete and the orthotropic behavior of unidirectional composites. Investigation results showed that FRP composites are good candidates for use in piling systems. Because of their flexibility in both geometrical shaping and layer lay-up, FRPs provide more options to designers to come up with suitable systems based on their needs. A new pile section is introduced to be used with or without concrete filling. The section consists of two flanges and a double web to allow flexibility in controlling the size of concrete filling between the webs. Analysis results showed that flexibility of the geometry of the new pile section and the flexibility of tailoring multi-layered unidirectional FRP composites make the pile customizable for best performance. FRP composites lend themselves to be optimized to achieve desired properties. The study showed that favorable stiffness and stress results can be obtained for composite piles in integral abutment bridges by optimizing the section's geometry while keeping a fixed cross-sectional area...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityFriction {{is defined}} as a force acting against the {{direction}} of motion and resulting in a dissipation of energy in an irreversible manner. The only frictionless motions in nature exist if particles or bodies move on a selected geodesic curve (a geodesic curve is a curve in which there are no forces acting on the particle) which does not give rise to a space dependent change of the field. Coulomb friction is independent from the speed of motion while viscous friction is proportional to the speed of motion. An instrument {{is defined as}} a device which transduces one physical quantity into another. Instruments may be classified into control - or measuring instruments. A better way to classify instruments is according to the physical qualities which are transduced. This thesis restricts itself to instruments in which a mechanical motion is present. An ideal instrument is defined as giving accurate and instantaneous readings. In such an instrument the directive force acting on the pointer should be proportional to the second time derivative of the quantity to be measured. Such an instrument has cumulative errors and is therefore impractical. The practical instrument requires a restoring force when the pointer is off the desired point. Such a restoring force causes vibrations of the pointer. Therefore, it is necessary to add a dampening force. The ideal dampener would bring the pointer to rest on the desired point in a minimum time. It would require a complicated computer. In practical instruments a dampener using viscous friction is used. The optimum value of the viscous dampener depends on the instrument error, which is caused by other effects. A formula relating optimum viscous dampening and instrument error is given. (See graph, Figure 5) The static errors of instruments caused by Coulomb friction are shown. The effect of Coulomb friction on gyro-gimbal suspension is discussed. Empirical facts about friction in bearings are collected. They are classified into the following categories: oil film separation, boundary layer lubrication, dry surfaces and ball or roller bearings. The effect of surface grain structure and grain direction on the sliding friction is demonstrated in practical examples. The mechanism of sliding friction with oil film separation is analyzed using hydrodynamic theory. The mechanism of air bearings is treated using thermodynamic theory. Oiling devices to avoid dry friction are described. A hypothesis for the mechanism of friction in surfaces with boundary layer lubrication is made, according to which such friction is caused by a vibration of the crystal-lattice. This hypothesis could be tested experimentally by X-ray diffraction or by artificially excited vibrations with magnetostriction oscillators which should effect the coefficient of friction. It is shown that the major part of rolling friction in bearings is caused by sliding friction. Designs for low friction ball and roller bearings are suggested. The effect of centrifugal force on high speed ball bearings is discussed. Instruments <b>without</b> <b>bearings</b> are described. The high sensitivity of optical and electrical instruments is pointed out. Mechanical instruments using fluid suspension, magnetic suspension and elastic suspension are described. A servo follow-up motion as a means to reduce friction is described.

40|$|Programmable {{matter is}} a {{proposed}} digital material having computation, sensing, actuation, and display as continuous properties active over its whole extent. Programmable matter would have many exciting applications, like paintable displays, shape-changing robots and tools, rapid prototyping, and sculpture-based haptic interfaces. Programmable matter would {{be composed of}} millimeter-scale autonomous microsystem particles, without internal moving parts, bound by electromagnetic forces or an adhesive binder. Particles can dissipate 10 mW heat, and store 6 J energy in an internal zinc-air battery. Photovoltaic cells provide 300 [mu]W outdoors and 3. 0 [mu]W indoors. Painted systems can store battery reactants in the paint binder; 6 J / mm 3 can be stored, and diffusion is fast enough to transport reactants to the particles. Capacitive power transfer is an efficient method to transfer power to sparse, randomly placed particles. Power from capacitive transfer is proportional to VDD 2 : 100 [mu]W at 3. 3 V and 12 mW at 35 V. Inter-particle communication is possible via optical, near-field, and far-field electromagnetic systems. Optical systems allow communication with low area (sub-mm) particles, and 24 pJ/bit. Near-field electromagnetic gives precisely controlled neighborhoods, localization capability, and 37 pJ/bit. Far-field radio communication between widely spaced particles may be possible at 60 GHz; antennas that fit inside 1 mm 3 exist; complete transceivers do not. A 32 -bit CPU uses less than 0. 26 mm 2 die area, 256 K x 8 SRAM uses 1. 1 mm 2, and 256 K x 8 FLASH uses 0. 32 mm 2. Direct-drive electric and magnetic field systems allow actuation without moving parts inside the particles. Magnetic surface-drive motors designed for operation <b>without</b> <b>bearings</b> are not power-efficient, and parasitic interactions between permanent magnets may limit their usefulness at millimeter particle dimensions. Electrostatic surface-drive motors are power-efficient, but practical only at particle dimensions below a few millimeters. We constructed a prototype paintable display; a distributed PostScript rendering system with 1000 randomly-placed 3. 4 cm nodes, each with a CPU, IR communications, and LED. The system is used to render the letter "A. " We present a design, not yet constructed, for a literal paintable display, with 1. 0 mm rendering particles, each with a microprocessor and memory, and 110 [mu]m display particles, with tri-color LED's and simpler circuitry. Storage of zinc-air battery reactants in the paint binder would provide an 8 hour battery life, and capacitive power distribution would allow continuous operation. We constructed a prototype sliding-cube modular robot, with 3. 4 cm nodes. The system uses magnetic surface-drive actuation. We demonstrate horizontal lattice-unit translation. We describe a design, not yet constructed, for a sliding-cube modular robot with 2 mm nodes. The cubes use standard-process CMOS IC's, inserted into a cubic space frame and wire-bonded together. Arrays of passivated electrodes, 1 [mu]m {{from the surface of}} the cubes, are used for electrostatic surface-drive actuation, zero-power latching, power transfer, localization, and communication. The design allows actuation from any contacting position. Energy is stored in a standard SMT capacitor inside each node, which is recharged by power transfer through chains of contacting nodes. by Ara N. Knaian. Thesis (S. M.)
