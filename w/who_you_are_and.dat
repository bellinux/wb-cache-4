He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor.

[...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee."

But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd.
