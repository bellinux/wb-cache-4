He threw arguably {{one of the best}} games of his career, throwing a complete game shutout while giving up just 4 hits in the 7–0 Giants victory. It was his first shutout since 2003 when {{he was a member of}} the Oakland Athletics. In a June 3 home game matchup with the Cubs, Zito pitched four-hit shutout ball into the ninth inning for a 2–0 Giants win and brought his season ERA below 3.00. In earning the win, Zito earned his 150th career win, becoming the 246th pitcher to hit the mark. Zito had a hand in the Giants' second road shutout win of the season when he pitched seven innings, allowing three hits and recording four strikeouts, in a July 17 game versus the Atlanta Braves. The win pushed his season record to 8–6. Zito would go on to finish the season with a 15–8 record, his most wins in a season with the Giants, while sporting a 4.15 ERA.|$|E

Described as 'the greatest of Cairns soldiers', he received a hero's welcome upon his arrival at Cairns, and was greeted by the Mayor of Cairns, the 'Returned Soldier's League' and an estimated three thousand people at the wharf.

25|$|Right-handed {{pitching}} prospect Reynaldo López {{was called}} {{up from the}} Class-AA Harrisburg Senators to make his major league debut <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> on July 19 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Nationals Park. During the game, López gave up a lead-off home run to Chase Utley, allowed three runs in the first inning, and gave up hits to seven of the first 11 batters he faced. After that, he improved considerably, retiring eight batters in a row at one point, striking out six of them. After he allowed three batters to reach base and gave up two more runs in the fifth inning, he was relieved. He left the game having pitched 4⅔ innings, throwing 105 pitches (65 for strikes), giving up six runs (all earned) on 10 hits (including one home run), and walking one but striking out nine. The Nationals lost the game 8–4, {{and he was the}} game's losing pitcher. His nine strikeouts was the second-highest strikeout total for a Nationals pitcher during a major league debut, exceeded only by Stephen Strasburg's 14 strikeouts on June 8, 2010. Although he ended up taking the loss in the game, López left the field to a standing ovation by fans. Also debuting against the Dodgers was Koda Glover, a relief pitcher drafted in 2015 who had been promoted {{all the way up to}} the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. The right-hander threw a perfect inning in relief on July 20, needing just four pitches to get three outs and seal an 8–1 Nationals win.|$|E

Two previous raids by Marines—on 19 and 29 August—had killed some of the Japanese forces camped in that area but had failed to deny the location as an assembly area and defensive position for the Japanese forces threatening the western portion of the Marine defenses. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct another series of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley. The purpose of these operations was to [...] "mop-up" [...] the scattered groups of Japanese troops east of the Matanikau {{and to keep the}} main body of Japanese soldiers off-balance to prevent them from consolidating their positions so close to the main Marine defenses at Lunga Point.

The latter game was his second loss of the season—the first having been earned on July 11 in his other start of the month, wherein he pitched six innings, allowed three runs, and walked five batters. Hansen's appearances from the bullpen were more successful; in [...] innings, he allowed three runs, all in a single outing on June 24 against the Cubs. His longest appearance of the month was a seven-inning relief outing against the Cardinals on June 13; starter Dave Koslo took the loss in the game for allowing three runs in the game's first inning, and Hansen completed {{the remainder of the}} game without allowing a run. In July, Hansen began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> on July 2, and ended with a win on July 31. His only start in July came against Brooklyn, when he pitched [...] innings and allowed four runs. He made two appearances in high-scoring games during the month without recording any outs: he faced two batters against Brooklyn on July 4, walking one and allowing a hit; and repeated the outing on July 10, this time allowing two hits and giving up two runs. Between those two outings, he appeared in both games of a July 5 doubleheader against the Braves, pitching two perfect innings in each game. His July victory came against the Cubs, when he struck out two batters and walked none in [...] scoreless innings on the month's final day.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 1993, Leslie Alexander {{purchased}} the Rockets for $85million. Following the bitter Game 7 loss in Seattle in overtime, Olajuwon gathered {{the team and}} famously stated [...] "we go from here". The next season, in Tomjanovich's second full year as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993–94 season by tying an NBA record <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> of 15–0. Led by Olajuwon, who was named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, the Rockets won a franchise-record 58 games. After quickly dispatching the Portland Trail Blazers (who had made the finals just two years prior) in 4 games, they then faced the defending Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, led by the previous year's MVP Charles Barkley. The series opened up in Houston, which saw the Rockets open up a big lead going into the fourth quarter. In both games, however, the Rockets inexplicably collapsed to allow the Suns a 2-0 lead going back to Phoenix. Following recent heart-breaking playoff losses by the Houston Oilers, it appeared as though the Rockets were doomed. Local newspapers labeled Houston as [...] "Choke City", which the Rockets took to heart and ultimately came back to win the series in seven games. As [...] "Choke City" [...] became [...] "Clutch City", the name permanently {{became a part of}} Houston folklore. The Rockets then soon defeated John Stockton and Karl Malone's Utah Jazz in five in the Conference Finals to advance to their third finals. The New York Knicks opened a 3-2 advantage, but the Rockets managed to win the last two games on their home court [...] and claimed their first championship in franchise history. Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP, after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game.|$|E
