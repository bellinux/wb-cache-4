Luftwaffe radars for both early warning (Freya) and gun-laying (Würzburg) were significantly more advanced than their British counterparts at that time.|$|E
25|$|The term Sufism {{came into}} being, not by Islamic texts or Sufis {{themselves}} but by British Orientalists {{who wanted to}} create an artificial divide between <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> attractive in Islamic civilization (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes that were present in Britain about Islam. These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent. The term Sufism has, however, persisted especially in the Western world ever since.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{has been}} a factor at Chichen Itza {{for more than a}} century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucatán in the public's {{imagination}} with his book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chichén Itzá. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron Emanuel von Friedrichsthal traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found.</b> Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented daguerreotype.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> {{was that}} many {{herpetic}} areas representing the peripheral distribution of single roots or individual {{sections of the}} cord, corresponded closely with areas of referred pain from diseases of different internal organs. This led Head to conclude that irradiation of abnormal afferent impulses produces a state of excessive irritability in the grey matter of the dorsal horn at the level which they enter it. As a result of this, impulses from the skin that pass through it are exaggerated or disordered so that a stimulus that would not usually provoke a painful reaction does so.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson is also {{recognized}} {{as being the}} first to use radioisotopes as tracers in field experiments. In doing so he along with his graduate student Vaughan Bowen, are credited with creating Radiation Ecology, a brand new major field of ecology. He again turned to Linsley Pond, he released twenty-four portions in two lines and dispersed it uniformly across the water, a week later they collected water across different depths in the lake. They then evaporated and measured the radioactivity, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> they deemed to be statistically significant. The rest was found to have been taken up by the aquatic plants in the shallow water area of the lake.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, an {{expedition}} led by Vladimir Alexeev with {{scientists from the}} Troitsk Innovation and Nuclear Research Institute (TRINITY) used ground penetrating radar to examine the Suslov crater at the Tunguska site. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> was that the crater {{was created by the}} violent impact of a celestial body. The layers of the crater consisted of modern permafrost on top, older damaged layers underneath, and finally, deep below, fragments of the celestial body were discovered. Preliminary analysis showed that it was a huge piece of ice that shattered on impact, which seem to support the theory that a comet caused the cataclysm. In contrast, in 2013, analysis of fragments from the Tunguska site by a joint US-European team was consistent with an iron meteorite.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's post-war cleanup in the 1950s, many ANT-40s {{that survived}} the Second World War were scrapped. In the late 1970s, however, Vozdushni Transport (A Soviet {{aviation}} newspaper) sent an expedition led by Evgeny Konoplev to survey an ANT-40 that {{was forced to}} land during a snow storm near the Yuzhne Muiski mountain range in the Baikal region. Konoplev considered <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> encouraging, with the aircraft being in fairly decent condition, in turn leading a team of VVS pilots to recover the airplane. It was returned to Moscow and restored {{by a group of}} volunteer Tupolev employees. The restored aircraft was unveiled in April 1982 at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino Airfield. Another ANT-40 is displayed in Verhnyaya Pyshma.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{financial}} success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, a sequel went into development from director John Luessenhop for a planned shoot in Louisiana, {{but failed to}} receive the greenlight to move forward. In favour of avoiding the convoluted continuity of the previous films whilst going in an unexpected direction, Seth M. Sherwood pitched Leatherface to Millennium Films as a prequel that would follow the titular character in a mentally competent state, enduring trauma that transforms him into the intellectually disabled murderer seen in the previous films. Maury and Bustillo signed on as directors after reading the screenplay, impressed with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> to be a unique take on the long-running franchise. The film {{takes place in the}} canon established by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Texas Chainsaw 3D, chronologically taking place before the two films.|$|E

500|$|Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts {{investigated}} how {{the effect}} held up under so-called 'threats' to the self. Earlier research by Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis had already {{shown that the}} name-letter effect is influenced by a perceived threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts first made some participants write about a personal flaw and then gave all participants the Number Preference Task and the Letter Preference Task. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> was consistent with previous findings: people who liked themselves a lot liked the numbers in their birthday and the letters of their name even more when an aspect of their self seemed under threat. This is predicted by the theory of unconscious self-enhancement. It {{can not be explained}} by [...] mere exposure theory.|$|E

Anna also tries {{to find a new}} life for herself, beginning work as a secretary for a magazine, but she is unable to abandon her feelings for Jacob. She eventually phones him from London and says that they will never find in others <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> in each other, and that they should marry. Soon after, Jacob breaks up with Samantha, returns to London and marries Anna in a small registry office ceremony with her parents as witnesses—both affirming that they will [...] "never allow anything to destroy the feelings we share for each other". With a tearful parting, Jacob returns to his business in Los Angeles while the couple wait six months before they appeal the ban on Anna's visa.|$|E
500|$|On September 27, 2011, Denali National Park ranger Brandon Latham {{arrived to}} assist four climbers {{belonging}} to a [...] "difficult access" [...] team from Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates. The reason for the inspection was the park agency's suspicion {{that there were more}} cracks on the monument's upper section not visible from the inside. The agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on August 23. After Hurricane Irene hit the area on August 27, water was discovered inside the memorial, leading the Park Service to suspect there was more undiscovered damage. The rappellers used radios to report <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> to engineering experts on the ground. Wiss, Janney, Elstner climber Dave Megerle took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument's lightning rod system atop the pyramidion; {{it was the first time}} the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since 2000.|$|E

500|$|The Museum of Bad Art was {{established}} in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—Lucy in the Field with Flowers—protruding from between two trash cans on a Roslindale-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited Lucy in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found.</b> When Wilson acquired another [...] "equally lovely" [...] piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled [...] "The Opening of the Museum of Bad Art".|$|E
500|$|Dumped is a British reality {{television}} programme which started on 2 September 2007 and aired nightly until 5 September 2007 on Channel 4. It involved 11 contestants living {{for three weeks}} on a rubbish dump next to a landfill site near Croydon, Surrey. The contestants who [...] "survived" [...] the 21 days and used only <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> on the dump were awarded £20,000 to share equally between them. The working title of the programme was Eco-Challenge. One contestant, Darren Lumsden, voluntarily left the programme on Day 3. The series was promoted with a large publicity campaign, which included advertisements on websites and a concert by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The programme achieved a peak of 2.4 million viewers, although this was marginally less {{than the number of}} people watching other channels at the same time. The programme was criticised because it was filmed on an artificial landfill and for its choice of [...] "fame hungry" [...] contestants.|$|E
500|$|When {{the miners}} from Nome, Dawson, Rampart, {{and other places}} arrived in the Tanana Valley, they were {{disappointed}} with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found.</b> Hundreds of claims were staked, but none were close to Pedro's discovery claims, which had been taken by {{the crew of the}} Isabelle and other early arrivers. Adding to the pressure on claiming land were men who, like Barnette, had power of attorney rights for others, and could thus make multiple claims. The Dawson Daily News reported that one man claimed 144 portions of [...] apiece. Around Barnette's trading post, town lots were claimed for $2.50 apiece, and there was fierce competition for the choicest spots. At the mouth of the Chena River, a competing settlement, named Chena, sprang up when two traders moved their store to the junction of the two rivers. Land speculation was fierce in Chena, where claims were frequently stolen and had to be enforced with firearms.|$|E
50|$|In England the Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre {{established}} a school at New Hall; although no longer ministering in the school, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>founded</b> continues to flourish. At one {{time there was}} a community at Hoddesdon, devoted to the contemplative life and perpetual Eucharistic Adoration. This convent was a link with the pre-Reformation canonesses, through Sister Elizabeth Woodford, who was professed at Barnharm Priory, Buckinghamshire on 8 December 1519. When the convent was suppressed, in 1539, she went to the Low Countries and was received into the convent of canonesses regular at Saint Ursula's, Louvain.

500|$|Scientologists {{around the}} world were {{presented}} with a glamorous picture {{of life in the}} Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> was rather different from the image. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all. Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the Royal Scotman was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship's entire crew to be reduced to a [...] "condition of liability" [...] and wear gray rags tied to their arms. The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meagre rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks. Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the Royal Scotman bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets. At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming. David Mayo, a Sea Org member at the time, later recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{attempted}} to aggregate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> to be polarised reviews of Imperial Bedrooms, noting that one Times reviewer felt the novel was simply dull, [...] "impoverished", and [...] "ghastly", whereas the London Review of Books felt {{that in spite}} of its flaws, the book was enjoyable for its [...] "beautiful one-liners" [...] and the fun of [...] "seeing the old Easton Ellis magic applied to the popular culture of our era ... iPhones, Apple stores, internet videos and Lost." [...] The New Statesman compiled reviews from The Independent, The Observer, and The New York Times. The first two reviews are positive, praising Ellis' [...] "modern noir", the book's [...] "atmosphere", and indebtedness to Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald, with the Observer saying it [...] "ranks with his best in the latter register [...]" [...] The latter review accused Ellis of falling flat, attracting negative comparison to Martin Amis; both have [...] "a flair for such perfect, surreal description" [...] but [...] "struggle to set it in an effective context." [...] Other writers attempting to gauge the book's reception also describe it as [...] "mixed". The Periscope Press deemed that the novel's reviews were mostly negative, citing Dr. Alison Kelly's article for The Guardian as the only counter-example, while deeming that it [...] "still read more like restrained criticism than outright praise".|$|E
