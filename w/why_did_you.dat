500|$|... "Dream a Little Dream of Me" [...] delves {{into the}} backstory of hunter Bobby Singer. The writers always knew his history would be [...] "grounded in family". Reflecting this, the {{original}} teaser depicted the supernatural deaths of Bobby's children; while eating dinner with his family, his children's throats are supernaturally slit, {{and they would}} ask him, [...] "Why, daddy, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> let this happen?" [...] However, the writers could not determine where to go from there. Following Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically possessed wife.|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> want to do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she had not}} set out to {{make her}} career in film, Robert De Niro's {{performance}} in Taxi Driver (1976) {{had a profound impact on}} young Streep, who said to herself, [...] "that's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up". Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's King Kong. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: [...] "This is so ugly. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> bring me this". Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, [...] "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. This is what you get". She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.|$|E
500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the voice on the other end to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave me all alone / Now {{you tell me you}} need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{stated that}} no {{contributor}} to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, [...] "Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> have to have it?" [...] In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated {{that he was not}} rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|E
500|$|Swan's {{time on the}} South Coast was miserable: {{family dog}} Zee died; wife Bex had a {{difficult}} birth with baby George; and Swan became a hate figure with his teammates and the local population at large after the club suffered a poor start to the season. Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted – the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got {{off on the wrong}} foot with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain at the expense of fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton £150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan [...] "If you're so desperate to leave, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come to Plymouth in the first place?"; his answer of [...] "For the money" [...] only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve {{towards the end of the}} season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994–95 – to Swan's delight.|$|E
