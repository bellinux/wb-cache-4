5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Captain Cliff Taylor and Acting First Officer John Hutchinson {{had managed}} to safely land their {{aircraft}} which, having lost an engine, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> carrying about 22,000 gallons of fuel, in the most testing of circumstances and almost certainly saved 121 lives. Taylor was recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise any member of the flight crew. Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain Taylor was awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E

5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b> In a contemporary inverview one of the rescuers says the survivor came running across the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b> It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within {{a few minutes the}} submarine <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was believed to have been sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b> He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E

During the scuffle, police officer Stewart Ferguson was spraying the burning man with a fire extinguisher. Popping and banging could be heard coming from the vehicle. A suicide note left behind indicates that the men intended to die in the attack.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{response}} was delayed because telephones {{inside the building}} could not be used. The plant owner's son drove to the fire station and informed them there that the factory <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> but {{did not say that}} workers were still in the plant. More than 100 medical and emergency service personnel went to the scene, some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided emergency evacuation for the injured via four air ambulances from the local hospital to nearby burns units.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 1866, {{while at}} his house at Duffield, {{he learned that the}} Oaks Pit, near Barnsley, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b> Together with three others, {{including}} Mr Smith, an engineer and Mr David Tewart, the steward of the colliery, he descended to make a complete exploration of the mine. They were one of the last parties to enter the mine; previous volunteers had been lost or had abandoned their rescue attempts. One of the party returned to the surface to send down volunteers, but Jeffcock remained below directing the attempted rescue.|$|E

Soviet officials and Mongolian witnesses reported that the plane then flew north, over Mongolia and almost to the Soviet border, but then turned around and began flying south before it crashed. A Mongolian who witnessed the plane crash reported that the plane's tail <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> when it crashed.|$|E

Whilst at this point Bravo had no casualties, they did need an ammunition re-supply and were eager to know Alpha Company's location and situation. Whilst engaged in heavy fighting, Bravo lost one of their Pinzgauers to an RPG round which had detonated the fuel tank. A few minutes later and the second Pinzgauer <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> and Bravo were having to fight through the streets to get to cover.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} this theory is that authorities were aware of Sydney being attacked {{at the time of}} or shortly after the battle, but deliberately delayed organising searches for survivors. There is no evidence that anybody ashore knew of the battle until Trocas found German survivors and informed the authorities. The Sydney Research Group allege that Sydney attempted to radio Darwin to report that the cruiser <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> and being abandoned. Other individuals or groups have made claims that they heard or witnessed the receipt of messages (either voice or morse) from Sydney, or saw transcripts of these messages. All claims state that transcripts and other evidence were later destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds ‚Äî I among them ‚Äî {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E

25|$|Hoover Field {{suffered}} from numerous, highly dangerous safety issues, including nearby hills, high-tension electrical power lines near the field, {{an amusement park}} to one side, a landfill that <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> (and which sometimes obscured the field), unpaved sod runways, tall smokestacks blocking the approaches, and more. Almost {{as soon as it}} opened, there were calls to close Hoover Field and build a large, modern airport at another location. In February 1927 a group of aviators and aviation companies, led by aviation pioneer Henry Berliner, called {{for the establishment of a}} new, larger airport across Military Road (the southern boundary of Hoover Field). When this did not immediately occur, Berliner began leasing and then took a majority ownership in Hoover Field.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1973, {{while he}} was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove away quickly. But the cloud, he said later, seemed to be {{following}} him. When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided {{it was safe to}} leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by a lightning bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} flare to land, the plane {{rolled to the}} right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing {{separated}} from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and {{the rear of the}} plane <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>fire,</b> coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 1,100 m from the runway threshold. The right wing was found on a taxiway 90 meters from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.|$|E
