40|$|Direct <b>waferbonding</b> is an {{appropriate}} technology to join two or more wafers of the same or of different materials. <b>Waferbonding</b> {{can be used to}} stiffen thin wafers during fabrication. However, conventional fabrication processes lead to an increase of the bond strength, which inhibits the required de-bonding. The propagation of cracks, which is based on a subcritical crack growth in the bonded interface, was used to cleave the bonded wafers. The subcritical crack growth is limited to the bonded interface, since the adjacent bulk semiconductor materials are inherently resistant to subcritical crack growth. The process allows the separation of Si-Si and Si-GaAs wafers after annealing. Wafer-bonded SOI wafers can also be separated with this technology even if they were annealed at 1100 °C. The first examples for wafer stiffening during fabrication and wafer transfer using the developed approach will be presented...|$|E

In this design, an InP based microring laser is vertically coupled to a passive feeding waveguides using a <b>waferbonding</b> technology. The vertical coupling is expected to detrimentally affect the operating temperature and device performance through the low thermal conductivity of the bond material. Thus, a thermal analysis is undertaken in the design stage {{to better understand the}} implications of this fabrication process.

The required bond material (BCB) has a low thermal conductivity and will strongly influence the operating temperature and thus the performance of the ring resonator through its insulating effect. A comprehensive thermal analysis of a proposed vertically coupled ring resonator of 50 µm outer radius is undertaken during the design phase to determine the thermal impact of: the design of the wafer bond, the design of the passivation layer and the optical power levels.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of silicon microelectromechanical components (MEMS) involves joining {{of two or}} even more wafers. During the last years special focus was given on low temperature <b>waferbonding.</b> In this paper an universal test wafer is proposed {{that can be applied}} for bond strength quality monitoring. The investigated wafers in this study were activated, wafer-bonded, annealed at 200 °C or 400 °C and subsequently tested with respect to dicing yield, tensile strength, fracture toughness, and surface energy. The wafer bonding was performed by seven different partners. It was shown that the bonding quality varied significantly for the different activation technologies even for the same annealing conditions. In general the special treated samples exceed the values of a RCA pre-treated reference sample annealed at 200 °C. Some of the activation technologies were able to create bonds that reached the value of RCA pre-treated reference samples, which were annealed at 900 °C...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a new collective microfabrication process of all-organic microcantilever chips. This method {{is based on}} the hierarchical combination of shadow-masking and wafer-bonding processes. The shadow-masking combines deposition and patterning in onestep thanks to spray-coating through a polymer microstencil that gives the opportunity of patterning thermosensitive material such as PMMA. The shadow-masking parameters have been optimized to obtain suspended microcantilevers characterized by a convenient thickness profile. The resulting PMMA structures were then transferred onto SU- 8 chips by using an SU- 8 <b>waferbonding</b> process. The effect of the UV exposure dose of both SU- 8 layers in contact on the bonding quality has been investigated and optimized. With the optimized bonding process we haveachieved the large scale transfer of microstructures with a yield of 100 % and a bond strength of 50 MPa. These microcantilevers were also tested at resonance, to determine Young’s moduli of patterned polymers. The low values obtained (below 5 GPa) make these organic MEMS structuresstrong candidates for highly sensitive sensing applications when used in the static mode...|$|E
40|$|Lithography as {{developed}} for IC device fabrication {{is a high}} volume high accuracy patterning technology with strong 2 dimensional (2 D) characteristics. This 2 D nature makes it a challenge to integrate this technology in a 3 dimensional (3 D) manufacturing environment. This article addresses {{the performance of a}} waferstepper (ASML PAS 5000) in several 3 D processes ranging form <b>waferbonding</b> and thinning to dual side processing with through silicon vias (TSV). Four different generic expose/etch strategies are discussed to fabricate vertical micro sieves, vertical through wafer silicon plate springs, dual side interconnect with TSV and vertical electrodes in deep silicon channels. It is concluded, that despite the 2 D nature of advanced waferstepper lithography a wide range of 3 D structures can be fabricated. The multi point alignment capabilities of a waferstepper can improve the overlay in several 3 D manufacturing processes and the high accuracy alignment system {{can be used as a}} metrology tool for further development of 3 D integration processes.

40|$|<b>Waferbonding</b> is a {{technique}} that integrates different semiconductors together, {{in order to obtain}} hybrid structures that exploit the strengths of each material. Work was done at the University of California at San Diego to investigate the <b>waferbonding</b> of III/V compound semiconductors to silicon using a metal interface. GaAs and other III/V compound semiconductors surpass silicon in their ability to create high performance microwave devices, while silicon offers an inexpensive platform with a proven digital architecture that can interface with microwave devices and support passive components and driver circuitry. Intimate integration of the two will be required, as mixed RF/digital and optical/digital systems for communications devices such as cell phones, wi-fi, and optical communications systems are pushed smaller, faster, and to higher power. The metalbonding implementation of a proposed heterogeneous monolithic microwave integrated circuit (HMMIC) system was investigated, and was shown to extend the capabilities of existing homogeneous monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) systems. The main goals of this work were two-fold; first to implement a robust heterogeneous integration technique, and second, to show that this approach uniquely improves upon existing microwave integration technology. The metalbonding technique investigated sparsely integrated GaAs structures onto silicon, in pursuit of this HMMIC scheme. Both bottom -up and top-down fabrication methods were implemented. These approaches required the development of a myriad of meticulously designed fabrication procedures capable of avoiding the many incompatibilities between the compound semiconductor, bondmetal, and silicon materials. The bondmetal interface, provided by these techniques, broadens the scope of existing monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology design possibilities. Essential bond interface properties were measured to establish the performance of this heterogeneous integration method. Passive bond test structures were designed, fabricated, and measured to extract the bond interface electrical behavior, electrical contact resistivity, and thermal conductivity. The In-Pd alloy, employed as the bondmetal interface between these GaAs/ silicon test structures, provided a universal ohmic contact between all doping combinations. The bond interface contact resistivity between n-type GaAs and p- type Si was found to be 1. 03 x 10 ⁻⁵ ohm-cm² and a bondmetal thermal conductivity of 2. 51 W/m-K was also determined. In addition, passive un-bonded and bonded microwave waveguides were constructed to test the microwave propagation properties of the bondmetal. The characteristics of these test structures qualified the metalbonding technique for use in heterogeneous microwave systems. The successful fabrication of these structures demonstrated that this metalbonding method could be extended to active devices as well, which would be of similar size, form factor, and utilize the same fabrication methods. An un-bonded active microwave waveguide, similar to one which could become common in heterogeneous microwave systems, was investigated to illustrate its unique microwave properties. This un-bonded traveling wave PIN semiconductor waveguide propagated microwaves in a 'slow-wave' manner, as a consequence of its diode structur...|$|E
40|$|Wafer-level {{integration}} of various advanced high-speed/high-frequency photonic andelectronic devices on a singlechip requires technologies to integrate different types ofsemiconductors in the lateral {{plane of the}} wafers. To date, many integration technologieshave been developed, including regrowth, selective area epitaxy, and repeated selective areadirect wafer bonding (WB), which is the method adopted in this proposal. The developmentofWB {{in the past decade}} has made important breakthrough in the opto-electronic device, likeLED (light emitting diode) and so on. Therefore, it is important to study this topic. The electrical performance of bonded wafers can be related to the microstructure andelectronic structure of the nano-sized interface. The detailed information and understandingabout the microstructure of nano-scaled interface is extremely important for the futuredevelopment ofWB and also the main purpose of this proposal. The important tools liketransmission electron microscopy with EDS (energy-dispersive spectrometer) and transmissionEELS (electron energy loss spectrometer) are necessary for this study. It is worthy to mentionthat the technique of EELS can give information like composition distribution and especiallythe electronic structure, which is extremely useful in studying the relation between density ofstates and electrical properties. In the first year, the microstructures and electronic structures of the bonding system ofn-GaAs will be studied. During the following year, p-GaAs will be studied and differentprocessing conditions will be investigated. Both results of n- and p- GaAs will be comparedand discussed.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{miniaturization}} of electrical components and systems has assumed large proportions. The reason for these developments is {{the application of}} etch and deposition techniques in the IC-production (integrated circuit), which allows {{a large amount of}} functionality per surface area. The IC-production techniques can also be used for the fabrication of functional elements, operating in other physical domains. This has led to the research area of micromechanics. With use of existing and to specific demands adapted or newly developed etch and deposition techniques, miniaturized sensors and actuators can be obtained with typical dimensions in the order of microns to millimeters. The described micromechanics research is carried out at the Micromechanical Transducers Group of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente and took place within the fast growing area of μTAS: micro Total Analysis Systems. The aim of the research is to design miniaturized chemical analysis systems by applying micromechanical fabrication methods to exploit the benefits from downscaling. These advantages can be: reduction of analysis costs, obtaining more compact, energy and reagents economical systems, performing a faster and / or more precise analysis, or performing of chemical analysis which are difficult or not possible with “macrosystems��?. The research is focussed in particular on modeling, designing and fabrication of components of a μTAS. The effects of downscaling on the influence of the different physical mechanisms on the behavior of microcomponents can be well analyzed with use of dimensionless numbers. In the considered microcomponents, the flow regime is in the range of Reynolds numbers around 1. Within this range, simplified models according to Stokes can be used. For stationary, fully developed flow in straight channels with typical microchannel cross-section geometries, analytical expressions have been derived to describe the velocity profile and the hydraulic resistance. The application of the virtual work principle (variational method) and the analogy of the mathematical description for torque of beams turns out to be very successful. Stoke’s theory is applied to modeling both the quasi-dynamic behavior of the pressure / flow sensor and the stationary, domain-coupled behavior of the valves. The hydraulic resistance of passive valves can be described well with use of the dimensionless relation Eu 4. Re = constant, in which Eu forms the Euler number and Re the Reynolds number. A good prediction of the behavior of microvalves turns out to be rather difficult though. The relative fabrication accuracy is poor, despite the used high absolute accurate fabrication precision, such that substantial differences between the measured and aimed valve behavior can occur. In this thesis different fabrication techniques and process designs are presented for the realization of the sensors and valves. For the manufacturing of a well-closing valve, selective bonding is an essential step. To achieve this, two methods are presented: selective anodic bonding of silicon to glass, with use of a chromium layer of less than 1 nm thickness and selective silicon to silicon bonding with use of siliconnitride layers. Besides <b>waferbonding,</b> much attention is paid to the application of anisotropic wet chemical etching of mono-crystalline silicon. By optimally using the crystal orientations in different wafertypes, combined with directional and anisotropic etching, powerful designs for microstructures arise. An example is the possibility to etch thin plates with high accuracy by using the switching of { 111 } planes in silicon during etching through the wafer, in combination with a suitable mask design. These plates can be used to create among others passive valve arrays with a limited number of process steps. For both and oriented silicon design rules are given for optimally using the possibilities offere...|$|E
