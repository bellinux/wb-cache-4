25|$|Cadbury were {{reliant on}} the canals for milk delivery, {{and on the}} {{railways}} for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton. They therefore needed a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail. The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham <b>West</b> <b>Suburban</b> Railway, which would extend from central Birmingham south along {{the path of the}} Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire.|$|E

25|$|Midland Railway trains {{that had}} used Curzon Street {{began to use}} New Street from 1854. However, its use by the Midland Railway was limited {{by the fact that}} those trains going between Derby and Bristol would have to reverse, so many trains {{bypassed}} New Street and ran through Camp Hill. This was remedied in 1885, when a new link to the south; the Birmingham <b>West</b> <b>Suburban</b> Railway was extended into New Street, this allowed through trains to and from the south-west to run through New Street without reversing.|$|E

It travels east to <b>west</b> through <b>suburban</b> Christchurch via Port Hills Road, Opawa Road and Brougham Street. This section of road used {{to be part of}} SH 73 and the speed limit is mostly 60 km/h. At the western end of Brougham Street at the Collins Street/Simeon Street lights, the Christchurch Southern Motorway commences. The speed limit here is 100 km/h.

50|$|Alexandroupoli {{is about}} 14.5 km {{west of the}} delta of the river Evros, 40 km from the border with Turkey, 346 km from Thessaloniki on the newly {{constructed}} Egnatia highway, and 750 km from Athens.

25|$|KMSP and WFTC {{have now}} merged as well, and KARE {{currently}} has a marketing agreement with KPXM-TV. The only station with its main studios in Minneapolis is WCCO, while St. Paul is host to KSTP/KSTC, KTCA/KTCI, and WUCW. KARE has a sprawling broadcasting complex in <b>west</b> <b>suburban</b> Golden Valley. KMSP {{is located in}} southwest suburban Eden Prairie. Other stations {{are located in the}} suburbs. For much of the last two decades, WCCO and KARE have shared in having the most popular evening newscasts of the area channels. On the other end, KSTP has struggled to maintain ratings on its news programs. KMSP has had a 9 o'clock newscast since at least the early 1990s when it was an independent channel.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Lake Street Elevated led to a political quarrel in <b>west</b> <b>suburban</b> Cicero, Illinois, {{which at the time}} included Oak Park and Austin. In 1898, Austinites, having a majority on Cicero's town council, used political influence to allow the extension of the Lake Street line from the city border at Laramie Avenue (then called 52nd Avenue) into their community. This infuriated other Cicero residents, who retaliated the following year by holding a joint election to force Austin's annexation to the City of Chicago. Much to the dismay of local residents, this effort succeeded, and Austin became part of Chicago in 1899. A century later, Oak Park commuters, who had come to depend on the service, were among the most vocal critics of the Green Line's closure for rehabilitation.|$|E

He led the <b>West</b> <b>Suburban</b> Conference in scoring and rebounding most of the season and was an All-Conference selection. Mueller posted his career-high 45 points on March 3, 1987 in an 8347 victory against Montini High School. By the end of his senior season, {{he was one of the}} 20 All-Chicago Area selections by the Chicago Sun-Times, in a class that included Eric Anderson, Bond, Liberty and Sam Mack, after averaging 23 points and 14 rebounds.

50|$|Also in {{the area}} are a number of {{independent}} schools including George Watson's College and a Steiner School. On the fringes of the area where it meets Craiglockhart (to the <b>west)</b> is the <b>suburban</b> railway line, which is mooted for reopening. To the north of the area is the Union Canal.

Farther south, the road enters areas of woods and homes, making a {{turn to the}} southeast. The road briefly forms the border between Manor Township to the southwest and the borough of Millersville to the northeast prior to fully entering Millersville and crossing PA 999, {{at which point the}} road passes businesses. Following this intersection, PA 741 heads through farmland before passing a few homes. At the Wabank Road intersection, the road enters Lancaster Township and passes a mix of homes and farms before crossing the Conestoga River. At this point, PA 741 continues into Pequea Township and runs through agricultural areas prior to entering the residential community of New Danville. Here, the route intersects PA 324 and forms a concurrency with that route, heading south on Marticville Road out of New Danville. PA 741 splits from PA 324 by heading east on Long Lane, passing more farmland and crossing into West Lampeter Township.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{continues}} directly north {{along the}} old Woodbine Avenue right-of-way to just south of Steeles Avenue, where it diverges to the west before continuing north.

50|$|In Romulus, Eureka {{continues}} <b>west</b> as the <b>suburban</b> sprawl on {{both sides}} of the road significantly decreases. The suburban sprawl stops completely east of Merriman Road as Eureka curves southwest and becomes a four-lane divided highway. The road then curves northwest as it approaches John Dingell Drive, which is the entrance to Detroit Metro Airport. Eureka transitions back into a five-lane road east of the Wayne Road/Wahrman Road intersection and I-275. Immediately after the Interstate 275 interchange, Eureka Road becomes a two-lane road as it approaches a CSX Transportation crossing and continues for a half-mile before ending at a stop sign and flashing red light at Huron River Drive.|$|R

5000|$|The two facing {{platform}} lengths at Isleworth are {{constrained by}} a bridge over a road {{at each end}} and front-seven-doors opening is used for most rolling stock. Forerunner 8-car slam door trains fitted the platform lengths, as at two other stations along the line. A commercial street adjoins the station becoming Hounslow High Street within 500 metres, to the <b>west.</b> The more <b>suburban</b> district of Isleworth is primarily south-east of the station, comprising the [...] "Woodlands" [...] residential neighbourhood and a medieval riverside hub of Old Isleworth for which the railway station is the same distance as Syon Lane. Those parts of Isleworth north and east tend to be termed Spring Grove.|$|R
50|$|Churchill Meadows, phase 4, {{was mostly}} {{developed}} from 2000 to 2010. The largest as yet undeveloped parcels {{in this phase}} are the 20 hectare McCracken Farm on Tenth Line, to be developed for semi-detached houses, and a 43 hectare property on Eglinton Avenue, to be developed for employment uses and a high school. Much of the new subdivisions are low to medium density residential, and as with the previous phases, land for parks has been protected from development. Unlike the previous phases, Churchill Meadows was built with a relatively permeable street network, and creek courses were not preserved. This section of Erin Mills borders the mostly rural section {{of the town of}} Milton, located to the <b>west.</b> The older <b>suburban</b> development of Meadowvale borders the area to the north.|$|R
