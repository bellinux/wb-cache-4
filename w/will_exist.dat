5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 <b>will</b> <b>exist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or <b>will</b> <b>exist.</b> Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E

50|$|Incompatibilism is {{the view}} that a {{deterministic}} universe is completely {{at odds with the}} notion that persons have a free will; that there is a dichotomy between determinism and free will where philosophers must choose one or the other. This view is pursued in at least three ways: libertarians deny that the universe is deterministic, the hard determinists deny that any free <b>will</b> <b>exists,</b> and pessimistic incompatibilists (hard indeterminists) deny both that the universe is determined and that free <b>will</b> <b>exists.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that <b>will</b> <b>exist.</b> According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.|$|E

50|$|One {{objection}} is {{that the}} possibility of your existing at all depends on how many humans <b>will</b> ever <b>exist</b> (N). If this is a high number, then the possibility of your existing is higher than if only a few humans <b>will</b> ever <b>exist.</b> Since you do indeed exist, this is evidence that the number of humans that <b>will</b> ever <b>exist</b> is high.|$|R
50|$|The Doomsday {{argument}} (DA) {{does not}} say that humanity cannot or <b>will</b> not <b>exist</b> indefinitely. It does not put any upper limit {{on the number of}} humans that <b>will</b> ever <b>exist,</b> nor provide a date for when humanity will become extinct.|$|R

50|$|Hard {{determinism}} (or metaphysical determinism) {{is a view}} on {{free will}} which holds that determinism is true, {{and that it is}} incompatible with free will, and, therefore, that free <b>will</b> does not <b>exist.</b> Although hard determinism generally refers to nomological determinism, it can also be a position taken with respect to other forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety. Hard determinism is contrasted with soft determinism, which is a compatibilist form of determinism, holding that free <b>will</b> may <b>exist</b> despite determinism. It is also contrasted with metaphysical libertarianism, the other major form of incompatibilism which holds that free <b>will</b> <b>exists</b> and determinism is false.|$|R

25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true {{to say that a}} fair number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues not covered by the Declaration of Principles and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, its view of capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether something akin to law <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> in socialist society.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydronium}} ion is very acidic: at 25°C, its pKa is 0. It is {{the most}} acidic species that can exist in water (assuming sufficient water for dissolution): any stronger acid will ionize and protonate a water molecule to form hydronium. The acidity of hydronium is the implicit standard used to judge the strength of an acid in water: strong acids must be better proton donors than hydronium, otherwise {{a significant portion of}} acid <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> in a non-ionized state (i.e.: a weak acid). Unlike hydronium in neutral solutions that result from water's autodissociation, hydronium ions in acidic solutions are long-lasting and concentrated, in proportion to the strength of the dissolved acid.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} homogeneous space {{concept is}} a special case of that of principal bundle: it means a principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles {{is that of a}} family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The 'origin' can be supplied by a section of the bundlesuch sections are usually assumed to exist locally on the basethe bundle being locally trivial, so that the local structure is that of a cartesian product. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a differential manifold M has a principal bundle of frames associated to its tangent bundle. A global section <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> (by definition) only when M is parallelizable, which implies strong topological restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Involuntary commitment, or sectioning, {{refers to}} {{situations}} where police officers, health officers, or health professionals classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, gravely disabled, or mentally ill {{according to the}} applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed {{which may or may}} not result in involuntary treatment. Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment <b>will</b> <b>exist.</b> While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason was}} the {{improved}} {{capacity of the}} U2 tunnel that was needed to accommodate the U3 traffic. Current subway lines in Nuremberg are built for a train frequency of 200 seconds or 3 minutes (sole exception: Ziegelstein-Flughafen: 400 seconds), which is already fully used on the U1 {{during the day and}} on the U2 during morning rush hour. With the new ATC system in place, additional (virtual) blocks <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> between stationary block signals, thus increasing line capacity to a train frequency of 100 seconds. However, these new blocks can only be used by ATC-operated trains since they are virtual and have no stationary signal associated with them that can be observed by a driver-operated train without ATC equipment. Thus the increased line capacity can only be effectively used after the U2 has been converted to full ATC operation.|$|E

25|$|Philosophers have debated {{both the}} truth of determinism, and {{the truth of}} free will. This creates the four {{possible}} positions in the figure. Compatibilism refers {{to the view that}} free will is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three incompatibilist positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The hard incompatibilists hold that both determinism and free <b>will</b> do not <b>exist,</b> the libertarianists that determinism does not hold, and free <b>will</b> might <b>exist,</b> and the hard determinists that determinism does hold and free <b>will</b> does not <b>exist.</b>|$|R

25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It is at this point when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. Because of the fact that S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries that are well developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to inseminate females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E
25|$|The Reconstruction Agency was {{established}} to replace the Reconstruction Headquarters {{in response to the}} Great East Japan earthquake, created on June 24, 2011. The Reconstruction Agency is headed by the Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. Noda was named direct head of the agency in an effort to strengthen the leadership of the organization. Tatsuo Hirano, a native of Iwate Prefecture, served as the agency's first Minister of State for Disaster Management until he was replaced by Osamu Fujimura on June 4, 2012. The Reconstruction Agency is not a Cabinet Office, but will have authority over other government ministries. The agency <b>will</b> <b>exist</b> for ten years, the length of time estimated to fully restore the region after the disaster, and be dissolved on March 3, 2021. A wooden tablet for the new agency was made from materials from the earthquake zone. Prime Minister Noda placed the tablet at the Akasaka Agency headquarters as a reminder of the responsibility to residents of the disaster-hit regions.|$|E
