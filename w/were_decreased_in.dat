Like its predecessor, the C60 was designed by Paolo Catone, {{and was the first}} all-new car since the Courage C41 was introduced. The C60 used a carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, whilst its suspension consisted of double wishbones, pushrods and horizontally-located dynamic dampers. SMG Compétition were the first team to run the car, and their C60 was fitted with a 4-litre naturally-aspirated Judd GV4 V10 engine, In 2001, Pescarolo Sport began using the C60 and their C60s used a Sodemo-developed 3.2-litre twin-turbocharged Peugeot A32 V6 engine, capable of a claimed power output of [...] In 2002, André de Cortanze redeveloped the C60 into the C60 Evo, which notably featured an unusual brake duct system similar to that found on an open-wheel racing car {{at the front of the}} car, whilst the rear wing endplates were redesigned and the Peugeot A32 engine now produced a claimed output of [...] The endplates were further developed in 2003, whilst the engine's air restrictors <b>were</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> size from , resulting in the claimed power output decreasing to [...] In 2004, Pescarolo began running the car as a [...] "Pescarolo C60" [...] with a 5-litre Judd GV5 V10 engine, as Henri Pescarolo had further developed the C60.

5000|$|Hormones {{also play}} a part in stress management. Cortisol, a stress hormone, was found to be {{elevated}} in males during stressful situations. In females, however, cortisol levels <b>were</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> stressful situations, and instead, an increase in limbic activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why men administer a fight-or-flight reaction to stress; whereas, females have a tend-and-befriend reaction. The [...] "fight-or-flight" [...] response activates the sympathetic nervous system in the form of increased focus levels, adrenaline, and epinephrine. Conversely, the [...] "tend-and-befriend" [...] reaction refers to the tendency of women to protect their offspring and relatives.

[...] They separately administered each drug (via intraperitoneal injections) to rats {{at either}} 5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg. Half of the rats were pre-treated with 1 mg/kg of the morphine antagonist naloxone, {{and the other}} half had no pre-treatment. Analgesic effects were measured approximately 15 minutes post-injection. Analgesic ability was measured using the Hot Plate Test; a behavioral test in which a hot plate was heated to 55oC and a male rat was placed onto the plate. A positive reaction was labeled as the rat licking its hind legs and/or trying to escape by jumping. Using the Hot Plate Test, animal behavior was monitored and the reaction time was recorded. They found that the latency period was enhanced by 50% with 20 mg/kg of tremetone, a significant increase over the 5 mg/kg dose. Mexthoxytremetone increased the latency period by 20%, but this effect did not differ significantly from the control values. They also found that the analgesic effects of tremetone <b>were</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> animals that were pre-treated with morphine. These results suggest that tremetone has a considerable amount of analgesic activity.|$|E
50|$|Yield {{management}} {{is a strategy}} which aims to monitor consumer behaviour to gain and achieve maximum profit through selling goods and services that are perishable. The theory behind this strategy {{is to focus on}} the following aspects: buying behaviour patterns of consumers, external environmental factors and market price to successfully gain the most profit. This strategy of yield {{management is}} commonly used by the firms associated within the airlines industry. For example: A customer may purchase an airline ticket in the day time for $600 and another customer may purchase the same airline ticket on the same day in the evening for $800. Reason being that during the day time the airline contained many seats that were spare which needed to be occupied and sold. Thus, prices <b>were</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> order to attract and manipulate the customers into buying an airline ticket with great deals or offers. However, during the evening time most seats were filled and the firm decided to increase the price of the airline ticket for the desperate customers who needed to purchase the spare seats that were available. This type of strategy is a vigilant way of connecting with the target consumers as well as flourishing the business.|$|E
