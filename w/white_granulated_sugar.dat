40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the impact of selected iron fortificants on the color of <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> and two products sweetened with the <b>sugar.</b> <b>Granulated</b> <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> was fortified with NaFe-EDTA, iron bis-glycinate, elemental iron powder, or ferrous sulfate to yield an iron concentration of 0. 12 mg/g sugar, with plain sugar as a control. Color change was monitored over three months by dissolving samples in water, and measuring the absorbance at 350 nm. A 12. 5 g sugar sample was added to 250 mL of brewed green tea after each month and was monitored at 560 nm. Hard candy was made with each fortified sugar and the control (unfortified sugar), stored for three months, and monitored for color changes at 350 nm. Color intensities of the fortified sugar relative to the unfortified control were as follows: iron bis-glycinate, NaFe-EDTA, ferrous sulfate, and elemental iron. These rankings changed little over time. Tea sweetened with fortified sugars ranked (most to least different from the control) as ferrous sulfate, iron bis-glycinate, NaFe-EDTA, and elemental iron. The candy didn?t visually change over time, although there were initial differences from the control candy. The color of the samples ranked (most to least different from the control candy) as iron bis-glycinate, ferrous sulfate, elemental iron, and NaFe-EDTA. The best fortificant for sugar depended on the application. Elemental iron was the best for <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar,</b> but NaFe-EDTA was most suitable for the candy, and perhaps the tea, since the elemental iron is insoluble in water...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Pullulan {{production}} using <b>white</b> <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> as {{carbon and}} energy source by two Aureobasidium pullulans strains (IOC 3467 and IOC 3011) was studied aiming cost reduction and maximization {{of the process}} yield. For this purpose, different sources of nitrogen – NaNO 3, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NH 4 NO 3, urea and residual brewery yeast – {{were added to the}} medium in different concentrations to a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 5 and 150. All nitrogen sources in the proportions tested were capable to promote cell growth and biopolymer production by both strains. However, for both stains fermentations, the amount produced and broth viscosity were dependent on the tested conditions. Overall, the best results were observed for the IOC 3011 strain. Residual brewery yeast was the nitrogen source that provided the greatest pullulan yield (0. 48 and 0. 55 g/g, strains IOC 3467 and IOC 3011, respectively) and the highest values of fermented broth viscosity for both strains. The results showed that the use of <b>white</b> <b>granulated</b> <b>sugar</b> and residual brewery yeast as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively, increased the pullulan production. The use of these carbon and nitrogen sources allow the cost reduction of pullulan production since they are renewable feedstock, low-cost, abundant and available worldwide...|$|E

The soil coverage with different forms of straw as well as the planting systems did not change the enzymatic activity of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD). The polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity increased with the use of a polymer due to increased polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity in the groove system.
