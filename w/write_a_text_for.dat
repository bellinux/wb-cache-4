40|$|In 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture {{published}} the 2013 Curriculum which demands teachers to implement authentic assessment as {{the method of}} assessing the students’ competence. There were three areas of students’ competence that should be assessed by authentic assessments, namely attitudes, knowledge, and skills. The types of authentic assessment {{that could be used}} to assess students’ skills are performance, project, and portfolio. This study aims at describing the implementation of authentic assessment to measure students’ English productive skills based on 2013 Curriculum at the eighth grade of a pilot school [...] State Junior High School 1 Ungaran (SJHS 1 U) in the academic year 2015 / 2016, explaining the problems the teachers encountered in implementing it, and explaining the solution used by the teachers to overcome those problems. The data were collected through interviews, class and document observations, were validated by triangulation of sources and analysed by using the flow model of Miles and Hubberman (1984). The results of the study revealed that the English teachers of the school have implemented the authentic assessment to measure students’ English productive skills. In doing so, the teachers asked the students to describe picture cues and retell the story as the performance assessments, to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>for</b> the portfolio assessment and to produce a comic for the project assessment. However, the implementation has not been conducted properly yet...|$|E
40|$|Saint Stanislaus, a Polish bishop {{murdered in}} 1079 by King Boleslaus the Bold, {{is the title}} {{character}} of Franz Liszt’s oratorio St Stanislaus. The libretto of St Stanislaus has several authors – the fi rst author was the Cracow man of letters and folklore scholar Lucjan Siemieński, whom Liszt asked to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>for</b> his oratorio. The libretto, completed in 1869, was translated by Peter Cornelius, who made certain changes {{to the order of}} events. Not until 1874 did Liszt set about writing the music for his oratorio in earnest, and that was when he asked Cornelius to revise the libretto. The author’s premature death thwarted that intention, and so Liszt was forced to seek other authors. The version prepared several years later by Karl Erdmann Edler fi nally met the composer’s expectations. In its fi nal version, the libretto comprises four scenes, which form a logical sequence of events {{and at the same time}} serve to emphasise Stanislaus’ spiritual strength and the causative power of his actions. Liszt did not succeed in setting the whole text of the libretto; the extant material covers only scenes 1 and 4. The musical style of St Stanislaus indicates that the composer drew on various types of musical inspiration and technique. Hence the work is characterised by a certain heterogeneity – a synthetic character that encapsulates a nineteenth-century aesthetics. Nevertheless, the oratorio is undoubtedly one of the most distinctive manifestations of Liszt’s interest in Polish subjects. The presence of quotations from the Polish songs ‘Boże, coś Polskę’ and ‘Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła’ lends the work a distinct national colouring and evokes a mood of solemnity and religious contemplation, as well as the aura of triumph, victory and domination. Such an attitude may be symptomatic of the typically nineteenth-century perception of Poland as a tormented nation deprived of its statehood, which thanks to its valour and resilience will ultimately regain its independence...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 105 - 113. This {{study is}} a description, {{from the vantage point}} of a {{participant}} observer, of the development of a new, and probably unique, method of writing, teaching and learning about an oral tradition - a method which is grounded in ways of knowing, thinking and learning inherent in that tradition. It arose in the course of a co-operative venture - between two lecturers in African Religion and myself - to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>for</b> South African schools on African Religion (sometimes called African Traditional Religion). Wanting to be true to our subject within the obvious constraints, we endeavoured to write within an oral mode. The product, African Religion and Culture, Alive!, is a transcript of taped oral interchanges between the three authors within a simulated, dramatised format. The simulation provided the context for using the teaching and learning strategies employed in an oral tradition, but within a Western institution. We hoped in this way to mirror and mediate a situation in which many South African students find themselves: at the interface between a home underpinned by an oral tradition, and a school underpinned by a written tradition. In the book, knowledge is presented through myth, biographical and autobiographical stories, discussion, question, and comment. The choice of this mode of knowledge-presentation has been greatly influenced by the work of Karen McCarthy Brown. A further important requirement for us was to produce a text that would be acceptable to all the particular varieties of African religious practice. This need was met in a way that became the most important aspect of the method - the device of setting, as a core part of the work for students, a primary research component. Students are required to seek out traditional elders within their community and learn from them, as authorities on African religion and culture, the details of particular practice. This is a way of decentering the locus of control of knowledge and education, as well as of restoring respect for African Religion and preserving information in danger of being lost. The primary research component highlights fundamental issues relating to the 'ownership' of religion, knowledge, power, reality which are explored in the study. Also considered are the implications of writing about an oral mode while trying to preserve as much of the character of that mode - writing by means of speaking. Text as a metaphor provides a frame for examining the process and the product - in terms of text as document, as score, as performance, as intertextual event, and as monument and site of struggle. Suggestions are made for further research, both on the particular method of text-production under consideration, and also on the approach to teaching and learning about African Religion. Also considered is the relevance of this particular learning and teaching approach to the values inherent in the proposed new curriculum for education in South Africa...|$|E

2500|$|By the 1750s, Paris audiences were {{beginning}} to tire of the formality, conventions, repetitive themes, mechanical tricks and great length of the lyrical tragedies. In the Enlightenment begun in France in 1715, critics demanded a new, more natural form of opera. The battle was launched by the first performance in 1752 of La Serva Patrona, a 1733 Italian opera by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi at the Academy by the company of Bouffons. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised the Italian opera for its simple plot, popular characters, and melodic singing. Describing the quarrel in his Confessions, Rousseau wrote: [...] "On the one side, {{the most powerful and}} influential, were the rich, the nobles, and women, supporting the French style; on the other side, more lively, more proud, and more enthusiastic, were the [...] true connaisseurs, the people of talent, the men of genius". Rameau defended his music: [...] "Do you not know that music is a physical-mathematical science, and that sound is a physical object, and that the relationships between the different sounds are made by mathematics and geometry?" [...] Roussau responded that music was the language of feelings; [...] "from the melody comes all the power of music over the human spirit." [...] To illustrate his point, Rousseau <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new one-act opera (intermède), Le devin du village ("The village soothsayer"), about the love of two simple peasants, which became part of the Academy repertoire for the next sixty years. Over the course of the 18th century, the heroic style of Lully and Rameau quietly disappeared from Paris stages, replaced by the more natural and more romantic Italian style.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} intra-textual connections of written English discourse. For that purpose, five samples (10 paragraphs each) from a widely-used American nursing textbook were analysed for independent clauses. Then the semantic connections through cohesion among their Themes and Rhemes across clause boundaries were identified and the frequencies of the four types of connections (Theme/Theme, Rheme/Theme, Rheme/Rheme, Theme/Rheme) were counted. The results of the analysis revealed that the average number of independent clauses in a paragraph was 4. 54, that nominal Themes were more frequent than adverbial Themes, and that Rheme/Theme and Theme/Theme connections across independent clauses were more frequent than Rheme/Rheme and Theme/Rheme connections.

During the Russo-Turkish war he was correspondent in the field (with the victors) of the New York Herald and the London Daily News--a capacity in which he made many out-of-the-way, many precious, observations. He has seen strange countries--the East and the South and the West and the North--and practised many arts.
