5|$|The {{test for}} {{judicial}} review on matters not {{relating to the}} ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|After David Duggan, {{leader of}} the Conservative Party {{and one of the}} men named, raised his concern over the {{pamphlet}} in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, police raided the Social Credit League's Edmonton headquarters.

Both were convicted of the libel charge, and Justice William Carlos Ives sentenced them to hard labour.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

He managed to stab the store owner, but was shot by his wife and later died in hospital. Police ruled out the shooting as legitimate self-defense. This case is notable, because the store the man attempted to rob was a gun store, leading many to speculations that the robbery was, in fact, a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus is {{the highest}} court in Belarus. While other courts deal with civil or {{criminal}} issues, the Constitutional Court deals with matters involving the Constitution and the legality of certain laws passed by the government.

Due to Abu-Jamal's continued disruptive behavior, Sabo ruled that Abu-Jamal forfeited his right to self-representation.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remake of Hawaii Five-O first came about in 1996, when CBS {{commissioned}} a sequel starring Gary Busey and Russell Wong, along with a cameo appearance by James MacArthur, who portrayed the original Danny Williams, as Danny who was promoted to the state governor. Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, <b>with</b> <b>Criminal</b> Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} that the correct test in judicial review proceedings is an objective one continues to apply in cases not involving the Internal Security Act. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the Court of Appeal remarked that, following Chng Suan Tze, {{the power of the}} Minister for Home Affairs under section 30(a) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to order the preventive detention of a person was dependent on the Minister's objective, and not subjective, satisfaction that the person was associated <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> activities.|$|E
25|$|Although incarceration {{in general}} {{has a huge}} effect on employment, the effects become even more {{pronounced}} when looking at race. Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males <b>with</b> no <b>criminal</b> record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males <b>with</b> a <b>criminal</b> record. Black males <b>with</b> no <b>criminal</b> record were called back {{at a rate of}} 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those <b>with</b> a <b>criminal</b> record. Black men <b>with</b> no <b>criminal</b> background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.|$|R

50|$|The {{defendant}} {{lost the}} benefit of a defence based on duress as it was deemed right that a person voluntarily associating <b>with</b> known <b>criminals</b> ought reasonably to have foreseen the risk of future coercion. Furthermore, it was stated that the policy of the law should be to discourage association <b>with</b> <b>criminals,</b> and should thus be wary to excuse the criminal conduct of those who do so.|$|R
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined {{together in a}} posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, angered by the harassment, targeted the offenders <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served {{as a basis for}} retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side. Partisans from both sides organized spying parties {{to keep track of the}} sheriffs of Wood County, Ohio and Monroe County, Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal officials could not control how state officials deal <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparing}} for their roles, the actors were granted access to lawyers who {{would act as}} advisors.

5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals <b>with</b> <b>criminal</b> organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E
