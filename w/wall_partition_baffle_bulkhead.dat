40|$|In many countries, {{the design}} begins by the {{performance}} {{definition of the}} building parts. The data are then used as a reference to select the viable construction technologies. In Brazil, this practice is still uncommon, mostly in residential projects, because, first, it is defined the architectural characteristics, technological solutions and cost for after consider the technical performance requirements. However, this scenario tends to change due to {{the publication of the}} Brazilian performance standard ABNT NBR 15575 (2008) that establishes requirements and quantitative parameters to the five main residential building subsystems (structure, floors, <b>wall</b> <b>partition,</b> envelope and covering, and hydraulic installations), besides to the general requirements for all building. The current version contains requirements for structural performance, fire safety, watertightness, thermal and acoustic performances, functionality, accessibility, environmental impact, durability and maintenance.

40|$|Abstract A {{characterization}} of gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers has been performed {{in terms of}} pressure drop behavior and heat transfer performance. The gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers differ by <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> material, <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and flow arrangement. The pressure drop behavior has been analyzed due to the pressure losses in different sections of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. Increased pressure losses in front of and behind the micro channels have been detected due to modified geometries in the inlet and outlet distribution chambers. The heat transfer performance has been determined in terms of thermal effectiveness. The comparison among different <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> materials and <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses showed no significant criteria {{of the influence of}} thermal conductivity on the thermal effectiveness. An assessment due to an overall heat exchanger effectiveness has been performed to compare the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. For this purpose, the overall exergy loss has been calculated by combination of thermal effectiveness and pressure losses. A strong impact of the exergy loss due to pressure drop has been detected which influences the overall exergy loss of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers...|$|R
