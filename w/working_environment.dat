To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to create a more energetic <b>working</b> <b>environment,</b> developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as Panzer Dragoon developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the <b>working</b> <b>environment</b> of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E

5|$|The design {{approaches}} of Monolith Soft have shifted over its lifetime, with early games such as Xenosaga and Baten Kaitos being distinguished by a narrative-heavy approach, while later titles have {{focused more on}} gameplay. The company's stated goals are to create projects with wide creative freedom and to allow younger developers to contribute to these projects. The company is also notable for its focus on promoting a comfortable <b>working</b> <b>environment</b> with little to no overtime in contrast to the majority of other Japanese game developers, alongside collaborating with other studios and companies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1997, Deal {{attempted}} to record tracks for a forthcoming album. Engineers and musicians {{on the project}} found that Deal's behavior and demanding musical standards created a difficult <b>working</b> <b>environment.</b> Deal's actions and the unenjoyable atmosphere of the recording sessions at the time caused Macpherson and Farley to leave the group. Several other musicians recruited throughout the year left for similar reasons. The 1997 sessions cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars through the use of four New York studios, the expense of moving equipment between them, and hotel costs.|$|E
5|$|Scandium has no {{biological}} role, but it {{is found}} in living organisms. Once reached a human, scandium concentrates in the liver and {{is a threat to}} it; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic, even through in general scandium is not toxic. Scandium is known to have reached the food chain, but in trace amounts only; a typical human takes in less than 0.1micrograms per day. Once released into the environment, scandium gradually accumulates in soils, which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles, animals and humans. Scandium is mostly dangerous in the <b>working</b> <b>environment,</b> {{due to the fact that}} damps and gases can be inhaled with air. This can cause lung embolisms, especially during long-term exposure. The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals, causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system.|$|E

5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot <b>working</b> <b>environment.</b> Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studied the}} air {{pollution}} problems {{that occurred in}} various <b>working</b> <b>environments</b> in Hong Kong through questionnaire survey and field measurements. Results of the survey showed {{that more than half}} of the respondents, who were affected by different kinds of air pollution, were suffering from either eye and nasal allergies, or throat irritation. Many of them recognized dust particulate to be the most serious air pollutant in their <b>working</b> <b>environments.</b> A portable laser dust monitor was employed to measure the levels of dust particulate that would be inhaled by people of different occupations and subject to different environments. The measurement results revealed that only some occupations were exposed to unacceptably high particulate levels. Generally, the particulate levels of most of the <b>working</b> <b>environments,</b> catering premises and entertainment places were much lower than the ambient levels and unlikely to pose any occupational hygiene problems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
