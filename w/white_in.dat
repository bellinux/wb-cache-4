2500|$|In {{the early}} years of film, black {{characters}} were routinely played by <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> blackface. In the first known film of Uncle Tom's Cabin (1903) all of the major black roles were <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> blackface. Even the 1914 Uncle Tom starring African-American actor Sam Lucas in the title role had a <b>white</b> male <b>in</b> blackface as Topsy. D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) used <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> blackface to represent all of its major black characters, but reaction against the film's racism largely {{put an end to this}} practice in dramatic film roles. Thereafter, <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or [...] "ventriloquizing" [...] blackness in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film. This stands in contrast to made-up whites routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.|$|R

Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to <b>white</b> <b>in</b> P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (<b>white</b> <b>in</b> P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 he {{finished}} {{a book titled}} Two-Faced Racism: <b>Whites</b> <b>in</b> the Backstage and Frontstage with Leslie Houts Picca (Routledge, 2007). Two-Faced Racism examines and explains the racial attitudes and behaviours exhibited by <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> private settings. While there are many books that deal with public attitudes, behaviours, and incidences concerning race and racism (frontstage), there are few studies on the attitudes whites display among friends, family, and other <b>whites</b> <b>in</b> private settings (backstage). The core of this book draws upon 626 journals of racial events kept by white college students at twenty-eight colleges in the United States. The book seeks to comprehend how <b>whites</b> think <b>in</b> racial terms by analyzing their reported racial events.|$|R
