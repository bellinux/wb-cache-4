25|$|Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in {{his rear}} at Mohrungen. He {{immediately}} called off the battle and retraced his {{steps toward the}} town. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwały), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Count Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under General Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake Marąg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 1997, Rude {{returned}} to the WWF as the [...] "insurance policy" [...] {{of the group that}} would become known as D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Chyna). The D-Generation X name was first used on October 13, 1997. As a member of DX, Rude never wrestled, but stayed ringside during the group's matches. A few days after the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series, Rude once again left the WWF. According to Bret Hart, Rude stayed in the locker room during Bret's confrontation with Vince McMahon after the match in Montreal, and later called Eric Bischoff, informing Bischoff that <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> in fact real. As Rude was not signed to a full-time contract with the WWF, and was instead performing on a [...] "pay-per-appearance" [...] basis, Rude was able to negotiate a deal with Bischoff and WCW, in large part due to his anger over the Montreal Screwjob.|$|E
2500|$|The rumor about Tarzan was, however, a wild exaggeration of what {{actually}} happened. According to [...] "Zane Grey Also Safe: Tarzan's Marital Status No Issue as Downey School Ban Is Denied," [...] an article from the Los Angeles Times that appeared on pages B1 and B11 on December 28, 1961, a rumor spread {{that one of}} the Downey elementary schools had removed Edgar Rice Burroughs and Zane Grey books from its library because [...] "1—There was no indication that Tarzan and his mate, Jane, were ever married before they took up housekeeping in the treetops," [...] and [...] "2—Grey was known to put such expletives as 'damn!' and 'hell' in the mouths of his western cowhands." [...] In a later article, ("Downey Furor Result: Schools Take Over Control of Libraries. Los Angeles Times, January 6, 1962, p. B1) the Times explained that the Superintendent of the Downey Unified School District heard this rumor and investigated the situation to find out what happened. He discovered that there was no [...] "ban." [...] <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that in one elementary school, a parent had put two Zane Grey books [...] "out of site in a desk drawer." [...] No Tarzan books were involved. The Zane Grey books were subsequently put back on the shelves.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the presidential}} {{election}} that was held in 1967, the military junta, which Kỳ chaired, intended to endorse only one candidate for the presidency. Kỳ intended to run, {{but at the last}} minute changed his mind and backed Thiệu, a move he later called “the biggest mistake of my life.” Thiệu nominated Kỳ as his running mate and the two were elected with 35 {{percent of the vote in}} a rigged poll. U.S. policymakers heard rumors that the generals had agreed to subvert the constitution, and The New York Times revealed the formation of a secret military committee that would control the government after the election. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that in the negotiations within the military, Kỳ had agreed to stand aside in exchange for behind-the-scenes power through a military committee that would shape policy and control the civilian arm of the government. Kỳ flatly denied these reports to Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and the U.S. Embassy notified Washington that The New York Times story was baseless. However, the story was later vindicated, as intelligence sources obtained the charter that told of the functions of the secret Supreme Military Committee (SMC). Walt Rostow briefed President Johnson and concluded that the SMC was “in effect, a scheme for ‘guided democracy’ in which a half dozen generals would decide finally what was good and bad for the country.” ...|$|E

2500|$|For this reason, on Sunday, November 30, 1941, Himmler {{placed a}} {{telephone}} call to Reinhard Heydrich, who, {{as head of the}} SD was also Jeckeln's boss. [...] According to Himmler's telephone log, his order to Heydrich was that the Jews on the transport from Berlin were not to be murdered, or in the Nazi terminology, [...] "liquidated" [...] (Judentransport aus Berlin. [...] Keine Liquidierung). [...] Himmler however only made this call at 1:30 in the afternoon that Sunday, and by that time, the people on [...] the train were dead. [...] <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that there was no housing for the deported German Jews when they arrived in Riga, so the Nazis left them on the train. [...] The next morning, the Nazis ran the trainload of people down to the Rumbula station. [...] They took the people off the train, marched them the short distance to the crime scene and shot them all between 8:15 and 9:00a.m. [...] They were the first group to die that day. The Nazi euphemism for this crime was that the 1,000 Berlin Jews had been [...] "disposed of." [...] Thereafter, on December 1, and, in a personal conference on December 4, 1941, Himmler issued strict instructions to Jeckeln that no mass murders of deported German Jews were to occur without his express orders: [...] "The Jews deported into the territory of the Ostland are to be dealt with only according to the guideline given by me and the Reich Security Main Office acting on my behalf. [...] I will punish unilateral acts and violations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ranjitsinhji {{returned}} to England in mid-May and immediately resumed the captaincy of Sussex. However, {{a succession of}} low scores and uncertain performances suggested that he was neither mentally nor physically fit for cricket and Simon Wilde writes that his failure to secure support in India and the continued pressure of threatened bankruptcy placed him in a difficult situation. The Australian cricket team was touring England once more and Ranjitsinhji, having played against the team for the MCC, was selected for the first Test. However, {{he seemed to be}} nervous and struggled to concentrate, running out his captain, Archie MacLaren before he was out himself for 13. Wisden noted: [...] "a misunderstanding, for which Ranjitsinhji considered himself somewhat unjustly blamed, led to MacLaren being run out, and then Ranjitsinhji himself quite upset by <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> <b>was</b> clean bowled". Although he scored 135 for Sussex shortly afterwards, in the second Test he was out without scoring. Over the next few weeks, Ranjitsinhji made good starts to several innings but lost his wicket to uncharacteristic lapses and leg-break bowlers continued to trouble him. He missed several matches, far more than he had missed in other seasons. However, in favourable batting circumstances he played two large innings in this period, hitting 230 against Essex and 234 against Surrey. An injury in the former game caused Ranjitsinhji to miss the third Test, lost by England, although his lack of confidence may have played a part in his decision. He returned for the fourth Test which England narrowly lost. However, he faced serious distractions from his parlous financial situation as one of his creditors presented him with a demand for payment shortly before the game. Ranjitsinhji claimed [...] after the match, falsely, that Pratap Singh intended to pay the debt but needed approval from the India Office, but it is likely that Ranjitsinhji anticipated another petition in bankruptcy going before a court and that this affected his performance in the Test. Showing signs of nerves, and never looking comfortable while batting, Ranjitsinhji scored 2 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. In the latter innings, when England had a relatively small target to chase for victory, he looked to have lost all confidence and could have been dismissed several times; the Australian players thought he played more poorly than they had ever seen. His lack of belief may also have contributed to the defeat, as Fred Tate notoriously dropped an important catch fielding, according to Simon Wilde, in a position which [...] Ranjitsinhji was more likely to fill in normal circumstances. Wilde writes: [...] " [...] failed to play their part, notably Ranji, whose abject performance was in marked contrast to his former days of splendour. The real reason for his poor performance has remained the knowledge of only a very few. At the time, a polite veil was drawn over his failure, but he was never to play for England again." [...] In 15 Test matches, all against Australia, he scored 989 runs at an average of 44.96.|$|E
