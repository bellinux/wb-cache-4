500|$|The next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV {{network and}} a fledgling {{competitor}} of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, {{he was the}} first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. [...] "The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada," [...] Jennings later recalled. [...] "I thought, <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> screw up? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> fail?" [...] Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States.|$|E
500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I hated that because <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don’t do that anymore? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E

500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events."

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't wait to hear the response? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was actually going to go, 'Oh, OK'?

2500|$|Jackson Benson {{writes that}} how a writer {{transforms}} biographical events into art {{is more important}} than looking for connections between Hemingway's life and his fiction. He believes autobiographical events may have a [...] "very tenuous relationship" [...] to the fiction similar to a dream from which a drama emerges. Hemingway's later fiction, Benson writes [...] "is like an adolescent day-dream in which he acts out infatuation and consummation, as in Across the River." [...] Meyers agrees that parallels exist between Hemingway and Colonel Cantwell, but he sees more similarities with Hemingway's friend of many decades [...] "Chink" [...] Dorman-Smith, whose military career was undermined causing his demotion. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life.

2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie.

And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

[...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away."

Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1989, Lynch had {{finished}} the pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications {{as a result of}} Dino De Laurentiis' bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, [...] "I've had a bad time with obstacles... It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that". Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, [...] "That’s great Monty, but <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?" [...] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his [...] "kind of thing." [...] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, [...] "It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as [...] "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," [...] and was also attracted to [...] "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about.
