5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1993 {{the park}} and {{pleasure}} grounds were acquired by the National Trust and it was {{opened to the public}} in 1996. In November 2002, a large-scale restoration project began on the cascade, serpentine lake and Gothic temple in the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area,</b> this is now complete. Extensive planting also took place in 2007. Future plans include re-roofing the grotto and building a replica Gothic temple.|$|E

5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E

50|$|The Wilderness Act was reinterpreted by the Administration in 1986 to ban {{bicycles}} from <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas,</b> {{which led}} to the current vocal opposition from mountain bikers to the opening of new <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980, Public Law 96-550, is a U.S. {{federal law}} that {{authorized}} {{the establishment of a}} number of designated <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> on National Forest land in New Mexico. The law also added additional lands to four existing <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> in New Mexico, and named several Forest areas for study as potential <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas.</b> The law also created two new National Park Service units, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and Salinas National Monument, from existing NPS lands. By means of this law approximately 400,000 acres of forest land were designated as <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas,</b> as described by the Wilderness Act of 1964, and approximately 75,000 additional acres were designated as <b>Wilderness</b> Study <b>Areas</b> for possible future inclusion in the Wilderness program.|$|R
5|$|The <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> {{is managed}} by Metsähallitus a {{government}} agency which manages the state-owned land in Finland. The area is not a strictly protected area, instead falling into the Natura 2000 network. Limitations include the mandatory maintenance of forests in their natural state and a ban on logging. The sale and leasing of land is prohibited, as is construction of permanent roads and mining.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E
5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b> The Park Service has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E

5000|$|The WILD Foundation {{states that}} <b>{{wilderness}}</b> <b>areas</b> have two dimensions: {{they must be}} biologically intact and legally protected. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (<b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas).</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the Wilderness Act generally prohibits commercial activities, motorized uses, and infrastructure developments in congressionally designated <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> However, the <b>Wilderness</b> Act and many subsequent laws designating <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> also contain provisions authorizing activities {{that do not}} conform with these general prohibitions. The general prohibitions and the authorized uses are important because controversies persist over permissible and prohibited activities in <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas,</b> and because bills often seek to modify existing areas or activities...|$|R
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly {{occurred}} in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{recreational}} opportunities along the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River watershed includes {{parts of the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount San Jacinto State <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Area,</b> Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river never actually flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Section III of Title One, {{also known}} as the Oregon Omnibus Wilderness Act of 1978, added three new <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> to the National Wilderness Preservation System and added {{additional}} lands to two existing <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas.</b> The areas established included: ...|$|R
50|$|Public Law 94-567 is a 1976 Federal {{law that}} {{established}} {{a number of}} new designated <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> on National Park Service lands. Signed into law by President Gerald Ford on October 20, 1976, the new statute added almost 900,000 acres of wilderness into the National Wilderness Preservation System. While the majority of designated <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> at the time were located in National Forests, {{this was one of the}} first laws to formally establish <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> in National Parks and Monuments.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with many}} other uses for the American people, <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> are popular for diverse kinds of outdoor recreation—but without {{motorized}} or mechanical vehicles or equipment except where specifically permitted. Scientific research is also allowed in <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas,</b> {{as long as it}} is non-invasive.|$|R
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area,</b> {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers {{developed}} and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected <b>wilderness</b> <b>area,</b> and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Noted {{that all}} of the areas named above would be {{considered}} as <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> as soon as the Secretary of the Interior published a bulletin in the Federal Register stating that all activities prohibited in <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas,</b> such as development, consumptive activities, etc. had ceased.|$|R
50|$|U.S. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Areas</b> do {{not allow}} {{motorized}} or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, but no roads, buildings, logging or mining are permitted. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas allow hunting in season.|$|R
5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped <b>areas.</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|R
5|$|Glacier Bay Basin {{in southeastern}} Alaska, in the United States, {{encompasses}} the Glacier Bay and surrounding mountains and glaciers, which was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, {{and which was}} later, on December 2, 1980, enlarged and designated as the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, covering an area of 3,283,000 acres (1,329,000 ha). In 1986, UNESCO declared an area of 57,000 acres (23,000 ha) within a World Biosphere Reserve. This is the largest UNESCO protected biosphere in the world. In 1992, UNESCO included this area {{as a part of}} a World Heritage site, extending over an area of 24,300,000-acre (98,000km2) which also included the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, Kluane National Park (Canada) and Tatshenshini-Alsek Park (Canada). Part of the National Park is also designated a <b>Wilderness</b> <b>area</b> covering 2,658,000 acres (1,076,000 ha).|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Area.</b> Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
