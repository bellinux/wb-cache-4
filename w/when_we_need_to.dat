The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull out <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> shut it down." ...|$|E

The storyline of the episode resembles David Cronenberg's film A History of Violence. [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] features several references to popular culture. For example, in a sequence {{at the beginning of}} the episode, Homer sings about working at the power plant to the melody of The Police's song [...] "Walking on the Moon". According to Chris Ledesma, music editor on The Simpsons, the staff was [...] "very fortunate to have obtained the original master tracks from The Police without vocals. This is a rare instance. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do our own lyrics to an established hit song, [...] usually arranges and records a 'sound-alike' that tries to capture all the spirit and nuance of the original so that the audience immediately identifies the track, but allows us to add our own vocals." [...] The episode also made frequent use of the sequence [...] "Dance of the Knights" [...] from the ballet Romeo and Juliet by Sergei Prokofiev. The sequence had to be licensed, as it was under copyright in most parts of the world.|$|E

[...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival <b>when</b> <b>We</b> <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E

Marshall quarterback Chase Litton returned after missing a loss to Louisville last week and threw for 240 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Michael Clark caught four passes for 147 yards, including an 83-yard touchdown as part of Marshall's methodical rally, one that hardly seemed possible after an opening 30 minutes in which Pitt did whatever it wanted.|$|R

40|$|With the {{popularity}} of OSNs, finding a set of most influential users (or nodes) so as to trigger the largest influence cascade is of significance. For example, companies may {{take advantage of the}} "word-of-mouth" effect to trigger a large cascade of purchases by offering free samples/discounts to those most influential users. This task is usually modeled as an influence maximization problem, and it has been widely studied in the past decade. However, considering that users in OSNs may participate in various kinds of online activities, e. g., giving ratings to products, joining discussion groups, etc., influence diffusion through online activities becomes even more significant. In this paper, we study the impact of online activities by formulating the influence maximization problem for social-activity networks (SANs) containing both users and online activities. To address the computation challenge, we define an influence centrality via random walks to measure influence, then use the Monte Carlo framework to efficiently estimate the centrality in SANs. Furthermore, we develop a greedy-based algorithm with two novel optimization techniques to find the most influential users. By conducting extensive experiments with real-world datasets, we show our approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art algorithm IMM[17] <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> handle large amount of online activities.
