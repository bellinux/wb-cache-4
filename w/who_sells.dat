5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} <b>who</b> <b>sells</b> his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{prevention}} in India {{has mostly}} focussed on heterosexual transmission. Data on homosexual transmission are {{not readily available}} from India. We therefore assessed the probability of acquiring and transmitting HIV for men <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex to men and compared this with women <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex in India. Methods Sexual behaviour characteristics of 6661 {{men who have sex}} with men and 6648 women <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex were obtained in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh through confidential interviews. These, along with estimates of HIV rates among them and risk of HIV transmission per unprotected sex act from other sources, were used to calculate their annual probability of acquiring and transmitting HIV. Results Of 6661 {{men who have sex with}} men in this sample, 1776 (26. 7 %) had sold sex to men. For every 1000 men <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex to men, annually 146 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 116 – 179) would acquire HIV and HIV would be transmitted to 55 (95 % CI 42 – 71) men <b>who</b> do not <b>sell</b> sex or women. These estimates were higher by 6. 7 (95 % CI 4. 9 – 9. 2) times for acquiring HIV and 2. 5 (95 % CI 2. 0 – 3. 2) times for transmitting HIV to sex partners outside their group, as compared with similar estimates for women <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex. In this sample, the average annual probability of acquiring HIV was higher among men who have sex with men but do not sell sex as compared with women <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex. Conclusion These data indicate that men <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex to men are at much higher risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than women <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex. Therefore, men <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> sex to men and their clients warrant substantial attention for comprehensive HIV prevention in India. </p...|$|R

Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side of}} the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau <b>who</b> <b>sells</b> body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge just as he did theirs.

After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This study {{explores the}} drug dealing {{behaviors}} of youthful offenders <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> drugs and examines {{differences between these}} offenders and those <b>who</b> do not <b>sell</b> drugs {{across a variety of}} measures including types of drugs sold, substance use and behaviors. Methods The sample consists of 227 youthful offenders in two juvenile residential facilities. Chi-square and t-tests are used to assess differences between youth <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> marijuana, hard drugs, and prescription drugs and those youthful offenders <b>who</b> do not <b>sell</b> drugs across a variety of measures. Results The majority of youthful offenders in our sample are involved in drug dealing and many are extensively involved. Drug dealing, however, is not tied solely to economic motivations but is connected to patterns of substance use. Youthful offenders <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> drugs are also engaged in patterns of delinquent and other risky behavior at higher levels but the magnitude of differences in substance use and delinquent or risky behaviors varies by type of drugs sold. Conclusions Youthful offenders <b>who</b> <b>sell</b> drugs are embedded in patterns of substance use and delinquent behavior that differ from those <b>who</b> do not <b>sell</b> drugs and interventions for these youth need to be targeted at multiple levels. ...|$|R

25|$|In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec {{passed a}} new zero {{emission}} vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker <b>who</b> <b>sells</b> in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year {{over a three-year}} average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas will be determined by Quebec's Ministry of Sustainable Development. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020. Initially, the provincial government set the goal in 2011 to have 300,000 plug-in vehicles on the roads by 2020.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, <b>who</b> <b>sells</b> about forty pieces a year.

25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor <b>who</b> <b>sells</b> goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E
