6000|$|... "By science," [...] said Miss Miniver, {{and hurried}} on, {{putting out a}} rhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove. [...] "And now, look at us! See what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become.</b> Toys! Delicate trifles! A sex of invalids. It is <b>we</b> who <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the parasites and toys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... {3} This {{was written}} sixteen years ago. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> since then more {{amenable}} to {{the influences of}} French civilisation.|$|R
60|$|Their idea, I think, {{was that}} through {{asphyxiation}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> comatose, and, {{but for their}} entrance, would have died unconscious.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} discouraged. After {{three weeks of}} waiting <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> alive to {{activity}} around us, and though it was unseen, we believed we would soon be on its track.|$|R
3000|$|Following the {{publication}} of our article (Li et al. 2016), <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> aware that the legends of Fig.  2 and Table  2 should read as follows: [...]...|$|R
500|$|His [...] "Weekly Chronicles" [...] spanned {{forty years}} (they {{have since been}} reprinted in twenty volumes) and would help prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish science and {{especially}} mathematics. [...] "Our national life," [...] wrote Prus, [...] "will take a normal course only when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free." [...] The social importance {{of science and technology}} would recur as a theme in his novels The Doll (1889) and Pharaoh (1895).|$|R
5000|$|From 75 {{registered}} parties <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{the only}} one to be pushed aside from the elections. From the party's lawyer Dmitry Krainev's statement after the court on 28 January 2015 ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Death had {{wiped out}} the memory of many things. I was thankful to {{remember}} that I had stopped divorce proceedings, and that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> reconciled for the children's sake. [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|He had a {{burst of}} muffled laughter. [...] "And now from robbers <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{soldiers}}. But look, Caballero, at those who made us soldiers and him a general! Look at these people!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The baneful {{consequences}} of either action or inaction {{can never be}} known with certainty but our reaction to either {{is affected by the}} two types of alarm-sounding Cassandras with whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> acquainted.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} social {{responsibility}} for university research administration has grown {{since the first}} grants were first allotted to universities. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more organized. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> expanded our boundaries. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> less of a single-standing organization {{and more of a}} node in a larger network of universities and research organizations. The synthesis that follows connects this notion to the literature in higher education and organizational behavior and to society at large. A research administrator should think about the impact of his or her decisions on this system. In the end, this article’s contents only scratch the surface of discovering the complexities within this vast system and encourage us to continue to define it...|$|R
60|$|She too, I think, had {{forgotten}} {{these things for}} a while. For it is curious and I think a very significant thing that since <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> lovers, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> talked {{very little of the}} broader things that had once so strongly gripped our imaginations.|$|R
60|$|We spoke no more, though <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> too used to {{one another}} for the silence to be awkward; and when the red light and the white <b>had</b> {{disappeared}} <b>we</b> returned to the cabin to finish the interrupted supper.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Miss Trevor," [...] I {{said to her}} one {{day after}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> more or less intimate, [...] "of course it's none of my business, but you didn't feel very badly after the Celebrity went away, did you?" ...|$|R
30|$|As {{the changes}} {{underway}} emerge, the filters and perceptive grids with which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> attempted to give {{order to the}} world do not help us to understand and harness something that surpasses the idea of space and, above all, the notion of city <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> used to.|$|R
5000|$|... from Present Tense {{review by}} Anis Shivani in The Huffington Post: “Anna Rabinowitz does apocalypse so well I can't {{get enough of}} it” “…Rabinowitz has the audacity to {{recognize}} how battered <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> by the inextricable link between desire and destruction.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> method actors, {{constantly}} flattered. Deception is luring {{because it}} is the inherent condition of the [...] "flattered-self". So we seek new ways of satisfying our selves. These are the true forces at work behind what de Zengotita calls the [...] "virtual revolution".|$|R
60|$|Most of {{that morning}} we spent {{with them on}} the hillside. Charles took them {{everywhere}} and showed them everything. He pretended to be polite to the scientific man, and he was really polite, most polite, to the poetical lady. Before lunch time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> quite friends.|$|R
60|$|We often {{examined}} the pistol that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{found in the}} house {{on the other side of}} the island, and Peterkin wished much that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> powder and shot, as it would render pig-killing much easier; but, after all, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> so expert in the use of our sling and bow and spear that we were independent of more deadly weapons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! I am,' he answered, 'sprung from a {{horde of}} Baltic pirates, who never were heard of during the greater annals of the world, a descent which I have been educated to believe was the {{greatest}} of honours. What <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>become,</b> <b>had</b> not the Syro-Arabian creeds formed our minds, I dare not contemplate. Probably <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> perished in mutual destruction. However, though rude and modern Gentiles, unknown to the Apostles, we also were in time touched with the sacred symbol, and originally endowed with an organisation of a high class, for our ancestors wandered from Caucasus; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> kings and princes.' ...|$|R
3000|$|With the {{proliferation}} of representations made possible by new media technology and distribution platforms, will the interests, variety, and reach of representations {{of race and ethnicity}} challenge and destabilize the structure and cultural dispositions of identity, self, community, belonging and politics to which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> so accustomed? [...]...|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{accustomed}} {{to an almost}} universal terminology for units of storage. Modern terminology applies across various operating systems and computer vendors, and is part of everyday conversation. Terms like megabyte and gigabyte mean much the same to everyone, and terms like mebibyte and gibibyte have been formally standardised.|$|R
5000|$|A romance ensued—"In {{the next}} season Mile. Vallee joined me as my regular dancing partner. Meanwhile, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> {{something}} more than good comrades. We found that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fallen in love." [...] (49, Maurice Chevalier's own story)—and Maurice Chevalier proposed in 1926; they intended to have a quiet wedding but the wedding's location had been leaked to the paparazzi.|$|R
40|$|Many {{critics of}} current {{economic}} policy and performance fret that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a debtor nation. They point with alarm to the growing, {{some would say}} mounting, debt we owe to foreigners. More than a little xenophobia enters when talk turns to Japanese purchases of our farms, factories, and office buildings. I...|$|R
40|$|Since {{publication}} of our book Empirical Processes with Applications to Statistics in 1986, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> aware of several mathematical errors {{and a number}} of typographical and other minor errors.

"From Etzingol to Turpan, from Spring of Wine to Chuguchak, we ... spent {{long years}} in {{following}} trade-routes, tracing faint caravan tracks, searching out innumerable by-paths and exploring the most hidden oases. ... Five times we traversed the whole {{length of the}} desert, {{and in the process}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> part of its life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charles Corm (1894-1963) was a Lebanese writer, billionaire {{industrialist}} and philanthropist. He {{is considered}} to be the leader of the Phoenicianism movement in Lebanon which ignited a surge of nationalism that led to Lebanon's independence. In a country torn by sectarian conflicts, Corm's intention was to find a common root shared by all Lebanese beyond their religious beliefs (the Phoenicians were pagans). Nowhere is this message of unity more clearly stated than in Corm's literary masterpiece, The Sacred Mountain: [...] "It is because back in their Times, long before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> Muslims and Christians, we were a single nation united in the same glorious past that Today, having grown in what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become,</b> <b>we</b> owe it to ourselves to love one another in the same way we did when we were still splendid humanist pagans." ...|$|R
30|$|Traditionally all {{patients}} with renal dysfunction and liver disease {{were classified as}} having the dreaded diagnosis of hepatorenal failure and labeled with a dismal prognosis and not offered further therapeutic interventions—thankfully things have and continue to change and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more elegant in both our descriptions and management of patients with renal dysfunction.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the director and long-term collaborator, Richard Lowenstein; [...] "The video uses harrowing visuals in order to portray man's ability to create havoc and destruction. The message behind the video is to show how as viewers, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> accepting of, and increasingly apathetic to images of gross human suffering and violence." ...|$|R
5000|$|More recently, {{film critic}} Dennis Schwartz {{wrote that the}} film [...] "proved to be Keaton's biggest {{commercial}} success. Its theme of civilized man versus the machine (seen as making life difficult for modern man because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> so dependent on it and it's not always reliable), was never used more effectively in cinema." ...|$|R
60|$|How we {{all looked}} at one another, to find the old beings <b>we</b> <b>had</b> loved, and to learn the new ones <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>become!</b> My mother was of course the least altered; indeed, to my surprise, she was more embonpoint than before, instead of having the haggard worn air that I had expected, and though she wept at first, she was soon again smiling.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{resource}} use {{is one of}} the most important and contentious issues of our time (Pelc 2002). ” In the United States, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> increasingly dependent on energy sources as our technology has increased and our standards of living have been elevated.

40|$|This Essay revisits {{the issue}} of the role that law school clinics can, and should play, in {{expanding}} access to justice. To do so we need to cast a critical eye on what we do, who we are, what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become,</b> and whether <b>we</b> need to rediscover, redefine, and reimagine our professional role as law school clinical teachers...|$|R

50|$|Nowadays it is {{customary}} to {{play this}} repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation. Thus over recent decades <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> accustomed to specialist artists with expertise {{in the art of}} vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in Spain), lute, Baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.|$|R
