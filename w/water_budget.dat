Water use impacts cover the public, private and commercial sectors and include water withdrawals, wastewater discharges, septic tank return flows, import/export of water via pipe networks, evaporative losses from irrigation, and lost recharge from impervious surfaces. The approach focuses on the impacts to baseflow and presents the results for both the wet and dry periods of the year. The approach identifies basins that are hydrologically out of balance and provides an estimate of the impact relative to natural streamflow.

25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for <b>water</b> <b>budget</b> in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E
500|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} supplements {{the measurement}} of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The <b>water</b> <b>budget</b> of an area can be calculated using the formula P − PE ± S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, then, {{is the amount of}} water that could evaporate in any given region. As an example, Tucson, Arizona receives about [...] of rain per year, however about [...] of water could evaporate {{over the course of a}} year. In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{the concept}} of <b>water</b> <b>budgeting</b> is discussed. This concept {{is based on a}} {{comparison}} between water resources and financial resources. It aims to approach water resources management problems more like a treasurer would. Water resources can be distributed {{in such a way as}} to optimise the chance of achieving a desired goal. Depending on what the most important goal of the water manager is, different ‘water budgets’ are possible. The concept of <b>water</b> <b>budgeting</b> is: to distribute the available water resources in such a way as to optimally achieve a certain objective. Model Predictive Control is considered a potential tool for <b>water</b> <b>budgeting.</b> This tool can translate the desired objectives into operational water management. The objective for the water system, in the form of penalties and constraints, are used as input for the Model Predictive Controller. The controller then determines the operational water management, which is most successful at achieving the desired goals. The concept of <b>water</b> <b>budgeting</b> is applied to the South-Western Delta in order to test its usefulness. Different goals are set for the area, and these different goals result in different operational water management strategies. During the application of the <b>water</b> <b>budgeting</b> concept several shortcomings became apparent. These shortcomings follow from the fact that: the comparison between water resources and financial resources is complicated by the physical properties of water. Two very important properties of water in this respect are: water is bulky and water is fugitive. These properties result in: water being difficult to store and transport, in comparison to financial resources. Because water is difficult to handle, it is not straightforward to <b>budget</b> <b>water.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>budgets</b> become very variable in time and space. Due to this variability in time and space the sum of the water distribution does not tell the whole story. The moment at which the water resources are used is equally, or might be even more, important. The application of Model Predictive Control, as a tool for <b>water</b> <b>budgeting,</b> has also proven to be limited. The most important limitation of using Model Predictive Control is: the reduced transparency of the decision making process. It is difficult to trace back why the controller ‘chooses’ certain control actions. This reduces the predictability of the operational water management. Reduced predictability of the operational water management, results in a less predictable water system. This will make it harder for stakeholders to be dependant on the water system. The application of Model Predictive Control to a water system of this size and without a very clear (single) objective is relatively new. During the research it became clear that: it is very important to be able to control all the (large) in and outflow structures, and that it is important to included the parameter that needs to be controlled in the internal model. In the case used, it was not possible to control the Maeslantkering. This resulted in limited control over the water bodies connected to the Nieuwe Waterweg. In the internal model water salinity was not included. This made it very hard to control salinity. Penalties for the controller were developed that were assumed to influence salinity. These penalties were however not sufficient to prevent salinities to become too high in certain areas. This shows that the controller needs to be able to directly predict what the salinities will be.

Many countries face serious problems because of water shortage.
