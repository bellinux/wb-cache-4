5|$|According {{to other}} reports, a {{motivating}} factor was {{the desire to}} establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom was {{commissioned}} by the Channel Four Television Corporation and produced by Objective Productions. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults {{to live in the}} flat with the three actors. These six contestants <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they would be starring in a new reality TV series called Making Friends, and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.|$|E

Searchers with CAP <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Fossett had gone out for a short flight over favorite territory, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake.

Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{towns and}} cities began to erect war {{memorials}} after the armistice, but Manchester did not get underway until 1922. As a result of pressure from the local branch of the Royal British Legion, the city council formed a war memorial committee, chaired by the mayor, to explore options for commemoration. The committee raised £10,000 in subscriptions and donors <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> local firms would benefit from the construction and resulting employment.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to be committed to the sinking fund.|$|E

[...] Although the right to counsel itself {{could be found in}} the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights, the right to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> one may see counsel is new to Canadian bills of rights.

5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they were now Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice {{and go back to}} England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E
5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} either Hotu Matu‘a or Tu‘u ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous {{plants such as}} the toromiro. However, there is no homeland likely {{to have had a}} tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.|$|E

50|$|The bottom {{three were}} Elan & Kenji, Beth Joy & Bella Starlet, and David & Elvis. David <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> his {{particular}} use of hand signals was confusing and distracting. Elan <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> her communication with Kenji was confusing and stressful to Kenji. She <b>was</b> also <b>told</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> bordering on being harsh with her dog. Beth Joy had put Bella Starlet {{in a dress}} that covered most of her body, {{which resulted in the}} judges being unable to evaluate her grooming.|$|R
5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Sudirman– who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor {{to ask about the}} possibility of a sponsored ride, but <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E
5|$|The coup was {{organised}} {{with the}} help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they were heading into the countryside to attack the Viet Cong. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.|$|E
