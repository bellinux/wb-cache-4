500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band began 1983 {{by playing}} the MTV New Year's Eve Rock 'n' Roll Ball with [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] still {{climbing}} the charts in the US, and the American reissue of the [...] "Rio" [...] single {{to follow in}} March. To satisfy America's appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US {{in the middle of}} the year with the addition of the new single [...] "Is There Something I Should Know?". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. [...] "Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty", Rhodes said later, [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in Times Square. We couldn't get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets." [...] Also in 1983, keyboardist Nick Rhodes produced the UK number 1 and US number 5 hit [...] "Too Shy" [...] for the English band Kajagoogoo and Andy Taylor became the first member of Duran Duran to get married.|$|E
2500|$|Irons {{performed}} {{with other members}} of Pearl Jam on Neil Young's 1995 album, Mirror Ball, and subsequently toured Europe as part of Young's backing band. With Irons, the band recorded its fourth studio album, No Code, released in 1996, for which Irons also toured. The band subsequently released Yield in 1998. [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. As a member of Pearl Jam, Irons brought a unique drumming style to the band, particularly in the way he played his fills and with his use of a trash can lid as a cymbal. Irons co-wrote the music for the No Code songs [...] "Who You Are", [...] "In My Tree", [...] "Red Mosquito", and [...] "I'm Open". He also wrote and sang on the Pearl Jam songs [...] "Happy When I'm Crying" [...] (from the 1997 fan club Christmas single), [...] "●" [...] (from Yield), and [...] "Whale Song" [...] (from the 1999 Music for Our Mother Ocean Vol. 3 compilation). He played with Pearl Jam through March 20, 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Jack wasn't in a position to carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] Vedder said, [...] "I think that him deciding that he wasn't {{going to be in the}} band really hurt." [...] Coincidentally, Matt Cameron, from Soundgarden, replaced him again as he did four years prior on Eleven's Thunk.|$|E
