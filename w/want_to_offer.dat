2500|$|Even {{before the}} ITF had {{announced}} their bonus, the Grand Slam controversy {{had taken on}} a life of its own. [...] Writing in 1982, Neil Amdur claimed, [...] "Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos, and tradition has almost gone the way of white balls and long flannels [...] If the four major tournaments <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> a $1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titles—and such talks have been rumored—that bonus would be a welcome addition. But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he 'hit for the cycle' after slugging a single, double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first time at bat in the second game." [...] Despite seeming clarity from the ITF, some journalists suggested that the sport's organizing body had turned its back on history and changed the [...] "rules" [...] of tennis by redefining a Grand Slam. [...] Such confusion continued for years. [...] For instance, when Steffi Graf completed the Grand Slam in 1988, George Vecsey wrote, [...] "Even the International Tennis Federation, which should have more respect for history, ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slam—and offered a $1 million bonus for it [...] But many tennis people, and most writers, and probably most fans, too, did not accept the new rules, and the I.T.F. has dropped the gimmick." [...] Vecsey was only half right: the ITF dropped the [...] "gimmick" [...] of the cash bonus, but it had never changed any rules.|$|E

6000|$|I think I {{ought to}} be allowed to talk as long as I want to, for the reason that I have {{cancelled}} all my winter's engagements of every kind, for good and sufficient reasons, and am making no new engagements for this winter, and, therefore, this is the only chance I shall have to disembowel my skull for a year--close the mouth in that portrait for a year. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> thanks and homage to the chairman for this innovation which he has introduced here, which is an improvement, as I consider it, on the old-fashioned style of conducting occasions like this. That was bad that was a bad, bad, bad arrangement. Under that old custom the chairman got up and made a speech, he introduced the prisoner at the bar, and covered him all over with compliments, nothing but compliments, not a thing but compliments, never a slur, and sat down and left that man to get up and talk without a text. You cannot talk on compliments; that is not a text. No modest person, and I was born one, can talk on compliments. A man gets up and is filled to the eyes with happy emotions, but his tongue is tied; he has nothing to say; he is in the condition of Doctor Rice's friend who came home drunk and explained it to his wife, and his wife said to him, [...] "John, when you have drunk all the whiskey you want, you ought to ask for sarsaparilla." [...] He said, [...] "Yes, but when I have drunk all the whiskey I want I can't say sarsaparilla." [...] And so I think it is much better to leave a man unmolested until the testimony and pleadings are all in. Otherwise he is dumb--he is at the sarsaparilla stage.|$|E

"I {{think you}} ought to have some place near the centre of London; not too west, for you might easily become fashionable, not too east because you might easily be {{swallowed}} up in merely philanthropic work, but somewhere between the two. There must be vacant sites still to be got round about Kingsway. And there we must set up your tabernacle, a very plain, very simple, very beautifully proportioned building in which you can give your message. I know a young man, just the very young man to do something of the sort, something quite new, quite modern, and yet solemn and serious. Lady Ella seemed to think you wanted to live somewhere in the north-west of London--but she would tell me very little. I seem to see you not there at all, not in anything between west-end and suburb, but yourself as central as your mind, in a kind of clergy house that {{will be part of the}} building. That is how it is in my dream anyhow. All that though can be settled afterwards. My imagination and my desire is running away with me. It is no time yet for premature plans. Not that I am not planning day and night. This letter is simply to offer. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer.</b> Here I am and all my worldly goods. Take me, I pray you. And not only pray you. Take me, I demand of you, in the name of God our king. I have a right to be used. And you have no right to refuse me. You have to go on with your message, and it is your duty to take me--just as you are obliged to step on any steppingstone that lies on your way to do God service.... And so I am waiting. I shall be waiting--on thorns. I know you will take your time and think. But do not take too much time. Think of me waiting.|$|E
