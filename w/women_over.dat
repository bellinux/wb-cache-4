5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|Militant {{action was}} not a {{hallmark}} of the movements in Wales and Welsh members, who more often identified themselves as suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means. In 1918, across the United Kingdom, <b>women</b> <b>over</b> the age of 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to vote as men.|$|E

5|$|Unemployment, {{especially}} among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems. In 2008, the jobless figure was at 4%, with <b>women</b> <b>over</b> represented at 85% of the total. In 2007 Bahrain became the first Arab country to institute unemployment benefits {{as part of a}} series of labour reforms instigated under Minister of Labour, Dr. Majeed Al Alawi.|$|E
5|$|Very severe {{hypothyroidism}} and myxedema coma are rare, with it {{estimated to}} occur in 0.22 per million people a year. The majority of cases occur in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 60 years of age, although it may happen in all age groups.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E
5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|The Representation of the People Act {{was passed}} in 1918 which gave <b>women</b> <b>over</b> the age of 30, who met a {{property}} qualification, the right to vote. Several factors led to {{the passing of the}} Act, including the efforts of working women, the dilution of anti-suffrage rhetoric and political change in London, where Asquith had been replaced as Prime Minister by Lloyd George. The government believed that six million voters would be added by the 1918 Act, in Wales the electorate rose from 430,000 to 1,172,000.|$|E

5|$|After the 1918 {{enactment}} of the Representation of the People Act, allowing <b>women</b> <b>over</b> age30 to vote, Singh joined the Suffragette Fellowship and remained a member until her death. Her arrangement of a flag day that year for Indian troops generated shock waves in England and New Delhi. In September 1919 Singh hosted the Indian soldiers of the peace contingent at Faraday House. Five years later, she made her second visit to India with Bamba and Colonel Sutherland. Singh visited Kashmir, Lahore, Amritsar, and Murre, where they were mobbed by crowds who came to see their former maharaja's daughters, and this visit boosted the cause of female suffrage in India. The badge she wore promoted women's suffrage in Britain and abroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised {{those who}} owned or leased land worth £10 {{or more and}} the Second Reform Act {{extended}} this to all householders paying £10 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended {{the provisions of the}} previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality wouldn't occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} eastern European countries, Belarus has a {{negative}} population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its fertility rate was 1.22, well below the replacement rate. Its net migration rate is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; {{the median age of}} 30–34 is estimated to rise to between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The average life expectancy is 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for <b>women).</b> <b>Over</b> 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are literate.|$|E

5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most <b>women,</b> <b>over</b> 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
5|$|Nine new {{events were}} held, {{including}} {{two from the}} new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3000 metre steeplechase for the first time. Marathon open water swimming events for men and <b>women,</b> <b>over</b> the distance of 10 kilometres, {{were added to the}} swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events. In fencing, women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team épée. Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian is the only sport in which men and women compete together in the same events. Baseball and softball may have made their last appearances in Olympics history during these Games, as the International Olympic Committee voted to remove them from the programme of the 2012 Olympics. A total of 958 medals for events (302 gold, 303 silver and 353 bronze) were awarded. In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each weight class. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. Additionally there were ties for a silver medal and two bronze medals.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the {{incidence}} rate in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000. The rate {{of ovarian cancer}} between 1993 and 2008 decreased in women of the 40–49 age cohort and in the 50–64 age cohort. Ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause, {{between the ages of}} 60 and 64. Ninety percent of ovarian cancer occurs in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> the age of 45 and 80% in <b>women</b> <b>over</b> 50. Older {{women are more likely to}} present with advanced ovarian cancer.|$|E
