500|$|... "We {{have had}} the {{opportunity}} to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there", Kean told the media. [...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Jamaica to an English mother, Johnson {{played for}} the England Schoolboys team by virtue of going to school in England. He was called up to the England U21 squad in December 1997 for a 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship {{qualification}} play-off game against Greece, but remained an unused substitute. After the game, he said: [...] "My chances with England are virtually gone now..I am ready if Jamaica come in for me. I was hoping for a game on Wednesday – and I still {{might have had a}} chance with England had they qualified for the last eight but that's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> I have enjoyed the experience of being with England but I am hoping to hear from Jamaica." [...] Johnson played his first senior international football in 1998, making a nine-minute cameo for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle in a 4–1 victory over Russia at Loftus Road.|$|E

5000|$|According to a {{statement}} on the back cover, the CD [...] "was mastered directly from the original half track analog reel to reel tapes, recorded at 7.5 ips. What you hear on the 30+ year-old tapes is the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drink and pass!" [...] he cried, {{handing the}} heavy charged flagon {{to the nearest}} seaman. [...] "The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> round excellently. <b>It</b> spiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> this <b>way</b> <b>it</b> comes. Hand it me--here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill! ...|$|R
2500|$|Brad Keselowski {{held off}} a hard-charging Ryan Newman and Matt Kenseth {{to win the}} GEICO 500. “I can’t believe it,” Keselowski said. “Talladega is such a wild card {{and to be able}} to win here you have to catch breaks and make your own breaks, a little of both. I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's just hard racing. That's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> at the end of these races. We weren't in good position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game, Sanchez remarked, [...] "It's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> and will {{probably}} be on a blooper reel for a while. That's just part of playing." [...] Sanchez would be proven right by ESPN's SportsCenter. Every Friday, SportsCenter has a [...] "Not Top-10" [...] blooper reel segment, culminating in the [...] "Worst of the Worst" [...] play, which is voted on by fans online. The butt fumble won Worst of the Worst for 40 straight weeks, usually by a landslide. Anchor Jay Crawford compared the lowlight with the Stanford Band's involvement in The Play during the 1982 Cal–Stanford Big Game, and with Jean van de Velde's meltdown at the 1999 Open Championship. Anchor Kevin Negandhi listed the ingredients {{that contribute to the}} play's longevity: it features a celebrity on a well-known team making an embarrassing mistake that is immediately punished by the opposing team scoring, and the comedic [...] "butt fumble" [...] nickname completes [...] "the perfect storm." ...|$|E
2500|$|The deal {{generated}} controversy after Canadian channel TSN {{had announced}} that the trade was complete, then claimed that the Flames had balked at completing the deal, believing they would need their players for a scheduled game. Consequently, Jokinen appeared in his final game with the Flames knowing through the media {{that he was to}} be traded afterward. When the trade was officially made, Jokinen bluntly described his feelings on the deal: [...] "It’s a brutal business. That’s the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> It comes with the salary. When you make $5 million, 11 goals is not going to cut it. ... It’s definitely {{a slap in the face}} to get traded." [...] Jokinen scored 15 points in 21 games with the Rangers. In the final game of the season, New York faced the Philadelphia Flyers with the winner qualifying for the final playoff spot. Regulation time ended with the two teams tied, and the game ultimately went to a shootout. Jokinen came up as the Rangers' final shooter, with Philadelphia leading by one goal. His shot was stopped by Brian Boucher, ending their season.|$|E

He confessed that he had found a restaurant on Third Avenue where they cooked beans in Texas style. I made him take me there. The minute I set foot inside the door I threw up my hands.|$|R
50|$|The incipit {{is modeled}} on {{that of the}} Rule of St Benedict. The letter is couched in firm, {{paternal}} terms.

2500|$|Cleverly {{earned the}} interim {{version of the}} belt on 11 December 2010 in an unimpressive contest with the Frenchman Nadjib Mohammedi at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Winning 115–112, 116–111 and 115–113 on the {{scorecards}} despite also having a point deducted Cleverly described his opponent as [...] "very awkward" [...] and said [...] "he was making me miss and dragging me in {{but this is the}} <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> sometimes." [...] Cleverly had fought for the interim title as the full champion Jürgen Brähmer {{was in the midst of}} an appeal against a 16-month jail sentence for assault and insulting behaviour. An appeal heard in Germany on 13 December 2010 would, if Brähmer had been unsuccessful and sent to prison, have resulted in the belt being vacated and Cleverly being upgraded to the full champion status. Proceedings however didn't result in the champion being sent to prison and a fight with Brähmer was scheduled for 21 May 2011 Speaking of the match up Cleverly said that he was glad that it was going to happen saying [...] "He's the champion and the only way I would consider myself a true champion is if I took the belt from him, rather than picking up the vacant title." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Birdseye {{gazed at}} her young friend complacently; the sheets of her interminable letter fluttered in the breeze. [...] "Well, it's {{delightful}} to see the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry, Wrenn. That's the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> in business, though. If {{you will}} go beating it around--A rolling stone don't gather any moss. Well, cheer up! Possibly there may be {{something}} doing in--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Named after {{a fictitious}} {{magazine}} referenced in the H. P. Lovecraft story [...] "The Unnameable", Whispers {{began as an}} attempt by editor and publisher Stuart David Schiff to produce a modest semi-professional little magazine that hoped to revive the legendary Weird Tales in a small <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>went</b> {{on to become a}} more elaborate showcase for dark fantasy fiction and artwork of the 1970s.|$|R

60|$|He kept {{close to}} the hedge when Pete vanished. The car had stopped where the {{military}} road cut across another that followed the river into the moors, and Graham apparently did not know which to take. It {{looked as if the}} fellow had ascertained that he was not at Hexham. After a time he heard the car start. It was not coming back, but he could not tell which <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> and waited in the gathering dark for Pete's return.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mother told you!" [...] said Cassy, with {{a thrilling}} and bitter {{emphasis}} on the word mother. [...] "What use is it for mothers to say anything?

In 1976, Martin Scorsese {{came up with}} Taxi Driver, a movie that went on {{to be viewed as}} one of the best films ever.

Over the years many directors have been inspired by its style and the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> about constructing a psychological study of a man leading a life shrouded by disturbing elements, or rather deconstructing the psychological state of disturbed man finding it difficult to come to terms with his environs.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} of September 1779. Under orders the forces of General John Sullivan, {{burdened}} down with heavy military equipment, marched north in their 450 mi journey through a wooded wilderness from Easton, Pennsylvania, over to Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and on up the Susquehanna River to Newtown (Elmira). They continued north through what is now known as Horseheads to the Finger Lakes region and west to Geneseo. They returned about three weeks later, having accomplished the purpose for which they had set out. The larger portion of the army under the immediate command of General Sullivan returned by the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>went.</b>|$|R
60|$|Exact {{book-keeping}} {{is to me}} {{the effect}} of a man whose heart is in his business, and who intends to thrive. He that cares not whether his books are kept well or no, is in my opinion one that does not much care whether he thrives or no; or else, being in desperate circumstances, knows it, and that he cannot, or does not thrive, and so matters not which <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have said}} so {{over and over}} again, and nothing has come of it. For my part, I don't care which <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> After the muddle that was made of it thirty years ago {{it does not seem}} to me more likely that we shall get rid of the Hanoverians now. Besides, the hangings and slaughterings then, would, I should think, make the nobles and the heads of clans think twice ere they risked {{everything}} again." ...|$|E

After all I don't know that his life has been so terribly bad. I daresay he's had everything very comfortable about him. And a man ought to be grateful for that, though very few men ever are." ...|$|E

60|$|The King of France, on {{the other}} hand, looked grave.
