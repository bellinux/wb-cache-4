2500|$|By November 2010, {{only two}} {{responders}} responded to ComReg's Television licence proposals consultation. These were RTÉNL and Vodafone Ireland. Points regarding <b>wholesale</b> <b>access</b> commitments considered {{critical for the}} successful provision of wholesale Mobile TV service {{and the provision of}} Mobile TV services for the benefits of consumers more generally were discussed. The two responders addressed points regarding automatic additional spectrum and ComReg outlined that it was minded to consider later award of mobile TV license when a national network for same would be possible of for other uses. The main concern was to whether there is demand for broadcast mobile TV, given experiences elsewhere or whether the award be made post ASO when international spectrum co-ordination is clearer.

The main reason cited by rivals for not providing services in the Hull area was rather one of overall cost effectiveness, given the relatively small number of potential customers (190,000 homes), and the fact that many of these would be likely to remain with the incumbent supplier.|$|R

40|$|The {{challenges}} of the broadband divide between rural and urban areas, {{and the demand for}} access spectrum exceeding the available supply, require regulators to rethink their approaches to spectrum regulation. Traditional spectrum management mechanisms resulted in artificial spectrum scarcity and hoarding whilst operators ignored their universal service obligations. This research report uses the regulatory impact assessment methodology to investigate what the proposed market-based spectrum licensing models of <b>wholesale</b> open <b>access</b> and managed spectrum park mean and the impact such regulatory approaches would have on the communications industry and technology progression. The findings of this research indicate that the <b>wholesale</b> open <b>access</b> and managed park are new concepts and were not well defined thus as a result are not well understood within the industry.

This research studies Telecom Italia's anticompetitive behaviours and regulatory interventions from 2004 to 2012, in order to understand and assess how the incumbent's strategies are affected by regulation.

These serve retail networks which in turn connect buildings and bill customers directly.|$|R
