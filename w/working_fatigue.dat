Methods: 48 patients with PD and 44 controls (CG), aged between 50 and 80 years and with at least 4 years of formal education, all with MCI and none diagnosed with depression, were assessed. Patients and controls were matched for age, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Participants underwent clinical evaluation with a neurologist followed by neuropsychological assessment employing the instruments: MMSE, Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test (semantic and phonemic), Figures Memory Test (FMT), Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Digit Span (WAIS III), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Hooper Visual Organization Test, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: The most frequent depressive symptoms in the PD group were: difficulty <b>working,</b> <b>fatigue</b> and sleep disorders (the latter also being present in CG).

The fatigue test result shows that roller working is more effective on improving the fatigue strength of the material than ion nitriding. On the other hand, the ion nitriding can much greatly increase the surface hardness than the roller working.

In general, the fatigue strength of plastic worked specimen is higher than that of non-worked one. However, the potential of hardening ability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy is very limited. Accordingly, the effect of work hardening on fatigue strength about this material is very small. In addition, the surface of the worked part becomes rougher with increasing plastic deformed value and the fatigue cracks initiate at this part. Consequently, the fatigue limit of the plastic worked specimen is lower than that of the non-plastic-worked one...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we {{introduce}} {{the idea of}} a novel group of strategies for further reducing fatigue-related risk in the workplace. In contrast to the risk-reduction achieved by reducing the likelihood an individual will be <b>working</b> while <b>fatigued</b> (e. g., by restricting hours of work), fatigue-proofing strategies are adaptive and protective risk-reduction behaviours that improve the resilience of a system of work. That is, they increase the likelihood that a fatigue-related error will be detected and not translate into accident or injury, thus reducing vulnerability to fatigue-related error. The first part of the review outlines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach and gives a series of ethnographically derived examples of informal fatigue-proofing strategies used in a variety of industries. A preliminary conceptual and methodological framework for the systematic identification, development and evaluation of fatigue proofing strategies is then presented for integration into the wider organisational safety system. The review clearly identifies fatigue-proofing as a potentially valuable strategy to significantly lower fatigue related risk independent of changes to working hours. This is of particular relevance to organisations where fatigue is difficult to manage using reductions in working hours due to operational circumstances, or the paradoxical consequences for overall safety associated with reduced working hours...|$|R

Structural fatigue failure in NiTi usually comes from a surface defect inducing crack growth, and this means that fatigue has to be studied for concrete applications, with the correct samples. Testing machine experiments on NiTi pseudoelastic wires show that the main parameter controlling the fatigue life in the traction-traction experiments is the effective stress on the NiTi wire. Long wire life (in the million cycle regime) can be achieved under limited stresses (under 170 MPa) in traction-traction tests.

The tension-to-tension fatigue strength of an annealed Ti- 15 Zr- 4 Nb- 4 Ta rod at 107 cycles was approximately 740 MPa.

40|$|Background - Australia’s mineral, {{resource}} and infrastructure sectors {{continues to expand}} as operations in rural and remote locations increasingly rely on fly-in, fly-out or drive-in, drive-out workforces {{in order to become}} economically competitive. The issues in employing these workforces are becoming more apparent and include a range of physical, mental, psychosocial, safety and community challenges. Objectives - This review aims to consolidate a range of research conducted to communicate potential challenges for industry in relation {{to a wide variety of}} issues when engaging and using FIFO/DIDO workforces which includes roster design, <b>working</b> hours, <b>fatigue,</b> safety performance, employee wellbeing, turnover, psychosocial relationships and community concerns. Methods - A wide literature review was performed using EBSCOhost and Google Scholar, with a focus on FIFO or DIDO workforces engaged within the resources sector. Results - A number of existing gaps in the management of FIFO workforces and potential for future research were identified. This included the identification of various roster designs and hours worked across the resources industry and how to best understand the influences of roster swings, and work hours on fatigue, safety, psychological wellbeing and job satisfaction. Fatigue management, particularly in relation to travelling after extended work shifts can increase the risk for road safety and influence safety performance while at work due to a culmination of long hours, roster cycle and accumulated sleep debt. Further challenges associated with the engagement of this workforce include feelings of isolation, physiological and general health and lifestyle concerns. Conclusions - FIFO workforces appear to be at an increased risk physically and mentally due to a wide range of influences of this unique lifestyle, particularly in relation to rosters, length of shift and feelings of community disengagement. Research and data collected has been limited in understanding the influences on employee engagement, satisfaction, retention and safety. Ensuring the challenges associated with FIFO employment are understood, addressed and communicated to workers and their families may assist...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to process}} W-Cu FGM for fusion {{material}} applications, in particular plasma facing components (PFC). Currently, PFCs {{are made by}} multi-material assembly and rely on tungsten armour tile (high heat flux side) which needs to be cooled by the attachment to a heat sink (Cu-alloys). The interfaces in multi-material assembly are unfavourable for the application (high <b>working</b> temperature, thermal <b>fatigue).</b> The use of FGM can be a new promising way. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the effect of a composition/grain size variation on the liquid phase migration during liquid phase sintering of FGM, in order to control the final composition profile. Bi-layer materials are processed by powder metallurgy route. W-Cu compositions with 10 and 20 wt%Cu and with different W-particle sizes are processed starting with attritor-milled W-CuO powder mixtures which are reduced at 350 degrees C. Analysis of copper liquid phase migration for different composition/grain size associations indicates that the phenomenon is driven by differential sinterability in the gradient. The copper liquid migration depends on the differences in sinterability, on the available liquid and open porosity in the structure beyond the melting point of copper. From these analyses, a way to control the gradient profile of W-Cu structure can be proposed...|$|R
40|$|The Cognitive Load (CL) {{refers to}} the load imposed on an individual’s {{cognitive}} system when performing a given task, and is usually associated with {{the limitations of the}} human <b>working</b> memory. Stress, <b>fatigue,</b> lower ability to make decisions and perceptual narrowing are induced by cognitive overload which occurs when too much information has to be processed. As many physiological measures and for a non-intrusive measurement, speech features have been investigated in order to find reliable indicators of CL levels. In this paper, we have investigated high-level speech events automatically detected using the CMU-Sphinx toolkit for speech recognition. Temporal events (speech onset latency, event starting time-codes, pause and phone segments) were extracted from the speech transcriptions (phoneme, word, silent pause, filled pause, breathing). Seven audio feature sets related to the speech events were designed and assessed. Three-class SVM classifiers (Low, Medium and High level) were developed and assessed on the CSLE (Cognitive-Load with Speech and EGG) databases provided for the Interspeech' 2014 Cognitive Load Sub-Challenge. These experiments have shown an improvement of 1. 5 % on the Test set compared to the official baseline Unweighted Average Recall (UAR). Index Terms: cognitive load measurement, silent and filler pause, speech onset latency, paralinguistic challenge 1...|$|R
