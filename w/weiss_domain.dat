40|$|This paper {{presents}} the efforts made {{to study the}} process of comminution to previous <b>Weiss</b> <b>domain</b> polarization and phase transition in piezoceramics together with the versatility of low-temperature-cofired ceramics-based devices and components for their ready adoption for typical applications {{in the area of}} micro-fluidics. A conceptual micro-fluidic module has been presented and few unit entities necessary for its realization have been described. The purpose of these entities is to position the sensors and actuators by using piezoelectric materials. Investigations are performed to make useful constructions like diaphragms and cantilevers for laying the sensing elements, cavities for burying the electronic chip devices, and channels for fluid transportation. In order to realize these constructions, the basic step involves machining of circular, straight line, rectangular and square-shaped structure in the green ceramic tapes followed by lamination and firing with post-machining in some cases. The diaphragm and cavity includes one or more un-machined layer stacked together with several machined layers with rectangular or square slits. The cantilever is an extension of the diaphragm creation process with inclusion of a post-machining step. The channel essentially consists of a machined green ceramic layer sandwiched between an un-machined and a partially machined layer. The fabrication for all the above constructions has been exemplified and the details have been discussed...|$|E

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a ferromagnetic material {{cause them to}} behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic <b>domains</b> or <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains.</b> Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch.

5000|$|Materials {{structures}} {{consist of}} intrinsic magnetic moments which are separated into <b>domains</b> called <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains.</b> This {{can result in}} ferromagnetic materials having no spontaneous magnetism as domains could potentially balance each other out. The position of particles can therefore have different orientations around the surface than the main part (bulk) of the material. This property directly affects the Curie temperature as {{there can be a}} bulk Curie temperature [...] and a different surface Curie temperature [...] for a material.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a variational {{principle}} is proposed {{to study the}} existence and structure of <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains</b> in elastic ferroelectric crystals. <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains</b> are defined as certain subregions of the crystal in each of which the polarization vector is uniform and has a constant magnitude which {{is equal to the}} saturation polarization per unit mass for the crystal. The variational principle differs from previous ones in that the variations of the domain walls are also taken into account and it is a direct generalization of the one corresponding to the rigid crystals which we have proposed earlier. In deriving the general theory the dependence on the polarization gradients are also considered and the effect of this dependence when passing from one domain to another is represented by an appropriately chosen surface energy on domain walls. The domain structure is studied under homogeneous deformation. The effect of a small deformation field on the shape of domains is illustrated {{in the case of a}} rectangular uniaxial crystal which has initially no electric field inside. It is shown that the deformation creates a small electric field in the crystal and domain walls change slightly...|$|R

5000|$|The above {{would seem}} to suggest that every piece of {{ferromagnetic}} material should have a strong magnetic field, since all the spins are aligned, yet iron and other ferromagnets are often found in an [...] "unmagnetized" [...] state. The {{reason for this is that}} a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material is divided into tiny regions called magnetic domains (also known as <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains).</b> Within each domain, the spins are aligned, but (if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration, i.e. unmagnetized), the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out, so the object has no net large scale magnetic field.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{magnetic}} energy of magnetic polymer composite materials {{as the average}} distance between magnetic particles vanishes. We model the position of these particles in the polymeric matrix as a stochastic lattice scaled by a small parameter ε and the magnets as classical ± 1 spin variables interacting via an Ising type energy. Under surface scaling of the energy we prove, in terms of Γ-convergence that, up to subsequences, the (continuum) Γ-limit of these energies is finite {{on the set of}} Caccioppoli partitions representing the magnetic <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains</b> where it has a local integral structure. Assuming stationarity of the stochastic lattice, we can make use of ergodic theory to further show that the Γ-limit exists and that the integrand is given by an asymptotic homogenization formula which becomes deterministic if the lattice is ergodic.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} in magneto-optical imaging (MOI), applying {{for the first time}} a ghost imaging (GI) protocol to perform Faraday microscopy. MOI is of the utmost importance for the investigation of magnetic properties of material samples, through <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains</b> shape, dimension and dynamics analysis. Nevertheless, in some extreme conditions such as e. g. cryogenic temperatures or high magnetic fields application, there exists a lack of domains images due to the difficulty in creating an efficient imaging system in such environments.

The technique is based on thermal light GI and exploits correlations between light beams to retrieve the image of magnetic domains. As a proof of principle, the proposed technique is applied to the Faraday magneto-optical observation of the remanence domain structure of an yttrium iron garnet sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{reducing}} power losses in electrical plates of Fe-Si, the strict current world is very complex, requiring a thorough knowledge of material structure and linked to it, {{the configuration of}} magnetic fields that is structured. This work aims at highlighting the influence laser radiation has on hysteresis losses in Fe-Si sheet plates, and the explanation of differences between the irradiated and non-irradiated sheets. Comparative measurements were carried out between two identical sheets, 300 x 30 x 0, 5 mm, for frequency and induction of magnetic field between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz, respectively between 100 mT and 2100 mT. It was noted in both sheets an increase of frequency of active power and apparent power consumption and coercive field intensity and for a fixed frequency was an increase of hysteresis curve area of irradiated sheets. Qualitative and quantitative interpretation of these results was done {{taking into account the}} microscopic structure of ferromagnetic materials (sheets of Fe-Si), in the sense that laser radiation increases the degree of fragmentation of <b>Weiss</b> <b>domains,</b> so the number of Bloch walls separating these areas and, also, the number of atoms (magnetic dipoles) inside these walls...|$|R
