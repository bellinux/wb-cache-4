40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe aim was {{to report}} {{the results of the}} first case in France of {{pediatric}} auditory rehabilitation with a middle ear implant and to discuss the putative indications with this new therapeutic option in children. Patient and methodsA prospective study over 18  months on clinical and audiometric results after a middle ear implantation with a Vibrant Med-El® implant in a 9 -year-old child with mixed hearing loss. ResultsPostoperative unaided pure tone audiometry (PTA) was unchanged by the surgical procedure. After 18  months of implant use, the mean PTA loss in free-field <b>warble</b> <b>tone</b> audiometry was 33. 75 dB and the intelligibility threshold was 30 dB. After 18  months of follow-up, the intelligibility threshold was improved by 25 dB in comparison with the preoperative results with two hearing aids. The implant worked perfectly well and the child did not show any complication during this period. ConclusionThe reliability of the implant {{and the quality of the}} auditory results obtained in this case and in a limited number of cases in the world make the Vibrant Med-El® a new therapeutic option in hearing loss in children with bilateral auricular atresia...|$|E
40|$|M QUALITY mSFEUTBB Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited Summary Page The Problem To develop a data base {{upon which to}} establish hearing-conservation standards for Navy di-vers exposed to waterborne noise. The Findings Bareheaded SCUBA divers may be exposed continuously for fifteen minutes to <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> centered at 2000 Hz through 3000 Hz at sound pressure levels as high as 161 dB re 1 //Pa, and to <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> centered at 4000 Hz through 6000 Hz at sound pressure levels as high as 171 dB re 1 //Pa without hazard to hearing. Bareheaded SCUBA divers may be exposed for four minutes to <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> (125 Hz through 1000 Hz) at sound pressure levels as high as 161 dB re 1 //Pa without hazard to hearing. Longer exposures at these frequencies and levels may not be innocu-ous. However, fifteen minute exposures to 500 and 1000 Hz <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> are not hazardous to ears at 151 dB re 1 //Pa. The <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> used here are comparable to 1 / 3 octave bands of noise or frequency sweeps of the same extent (e. g. some sonar transmissions).

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} nontonal stimuli {{that could be used}} to perform the Visual Reinforcement Audiometry screening procedure. This clinical procedure uses 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> at screening levels of 30 dB SPL and 25 dB SPL respectively. A range of nontonal stimuli were recorded on compact disk, their dominant frequency identified, and the stimuli octave-band filtered. Following a survey among experienced paediatric audiologists, a set of six stimuli was selected. These were 1000 Hz and 4000 Hz <b>warble</b> <b>tones,</b> filtered speech at 1000 Hz (/ala/) and 4000 Hz (/s/), and filtered noisemakers at 1000 Hz (a synthetic simple melody) and 4000 Hz (a non-reed squeaker). Forty-two babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 30 months participated in the project. The results showed that some nontonal stimuli were equally effective to traditional <b>warble</b> <b>tones,</b> one was less effective, and none were more effective. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Originally this voltage {{was used}} to trigger an {{electromagnet}} to ring a bell installed inside the telephone, or in a near-by mounted ringer box. Fixed phones of the late 20th century and later detect this ringing current voltage and trigger a <b>warbling</b> <b>tone</b> electronically. Mobile phones have been fully digital since the early 1990s second-generation ("2G") devices, hence are signaled to ring {{as part of the}} protocol they use to communicate with the cell base stations.|$|R
50|$|Obvious jamming is easy {{to detect}} {{because it can be}} heard on the {{receiving}} equipment. It usually is some type of noise such as stepped tones (bagpipes), random-keyed code, pulses, music (often distorted), erratically <b>warbling</b> <b>tones,</b> highly distorted speech, random noise (hiss) and recorded sounds. Various combinations of these methods may be used often accompanied by regular morse identification signal to enable individual transmitters to be identified in order to assess their effectiveness. For example, China, which used jamming extensively and still does, plays a loop of traditional Chinese music while it is jamming channels (c.f. Attempted jamming of numbers stations).|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, several sets {{of warning}} tones {{have been used}} which varied over time, by {{government}} structure, and by manufacturer. The initial alerts used during World War II were the Alert Signal (a 3-5 minute steady continuous siren tone), and the Attack Signal (a 3-5 minute wail siren tone, or series of short tone bursts on devices incapable of wavering, such as whistles). The Victory Siren manual stated that when manual generation of the <b>warbling</b> <b>tone</b> was required, it could be achieved by holding the Signal switch on for 8 seconds and off for 4 seconds. In 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Administration revised the signals, naming the alert signal [...] "red alert" [...] and adding an [...] "all-clear" [...] signal, defined as three one-minute steady blasts, with two minutes of silence between blasts.|$|R
40|$|An audit was {{undertaken}} {{of the first}} 36 children who had received cochlear implants in Nottingham. These children had previously derived no benefit from prolonged trials of powerful hearing aids. Following implantation, all children could hear <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> at all audiometric frequencies from 500 to 4000 Hz at sound pressure levels between 30 and 50 dB. The majority of children implanted below the age of 5 years developed intelligible spoken language after 3 years. The outcomes for children born deaf and those who acquired deafness {{under the age of}} 3 years were substantially similar. The best results were obtained in those children who were implanted before the age of 5 years or in whom the deafness was of short duration. The needs of implanted children continue over many years.

50|$|There {{are cases}} where {{conventional}} PTA {{is not an}} appropriate or effective method of threshold testing. Procedural changes to the conventional test method may be necessary with populations {{who are unable to}} cooperate with the test in order to obtain hearing thresholds. Sound field audiometry may be more suitable when patients are unable to wear earphones, as the stimuli are usually presented by loudspeaker. A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained, results are not ear specific. In addition, response to pure tone stimuli may be limited, because in a sound field pure tones create standing waves, which alter sound intensity within the sound field. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} use other stimuli, such as <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> in sound field testing. There are variations of conventional audiometry testing that are designed specifically for young children and infants, such as behavioral observation audiometry, visual reinforcement audiometry and play audiometry.|$|R
40|$|Conclusions: The Bonebridge (R) (BB) {{transcutaneous}} bone conductive implant (BCI) may overcome some of {{the issues}} related to a percutaneous BCI, such as management of the external screw, delayed activation or possible skin complications. Moreover, it has been shown to enable a functional outcome similar to percutaneous BCI in both conductive and mixed types of hearing loss. Objectives: To obtain clinical data from a preliminary series of patients implanted with a new transcutaneous BCI. Methods: Four subjects affected by conductive/mixed hearing loss underwent implantation of the BB by two approaches: the transmastoid, presigmoid approach and the retrosigmoid approach. Soundfield thresholds were assessed with <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> in a soundproof audiometric booth, and word recognition scores (WRSs) as speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were used to compare the unaided versus the post-implantation condition. Results: The surgical procedure was completed in all cases, with only minor intraoperative divergence from the CT-based planning and no postoperative complications. The average improvement of the SRT in quiet with the BB in comparison to the unaided condition was 36. 25 dB. All the implanted subjects reached SRT values below 65 dB, indicating a better understanding in quiet, with 100 % word recognition...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} types {{of this form}} of signal jamming are random noise, random pulse, stepped <b>tones,</b> <b>warbler,</b> random keyed {{modulated}} CW, tone, rotary, pulse, spark, recorded sounds, gulls, and sweep-through.

40|$|Hypothesis:The {{transcutaneous}} {{bone conduction}} implant (BCI) is compared with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) under {{the hypothesis that}} the BCI can give similar rehabilitation from an audiological as well as patient-related point of view. Background:Patients suffering from conductive and mixed hearing losses can often benefit more from rehabilitation using bone conduction devices (BCDs) rather than conventional air conduction devices. The most widely used BCD is the percutaneous BAHA, with a permanent skin-penetrating abutment. To overcome issues related to percutaneous BCDs, the trend today is to develop transcutaneous devices, with intact skin. The BCI is an active transcutaneous device currently in a clinical trial phase. A potential limitation of active transcutaneous devices is the loss of power in the induction link over the skin. To address this issue, countermeasures are taken {{in the design of the}} BCI, which is therefore expected to be as effective as percutaneous BCDs. Methods:An early observational study with a matched-pair design was performed to compare BCI and BAHA groups of patients over several audiometric measurements, including speech audiometry and <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> thresholds with and without the device. Additionally, questionnaires were used to assess the general health condition, benefit, and satisfaction level of patients. Results:No statistically significant difference was detected in any of the audiological measurements. The outcome of patient-related measurements was slightly superior for BCI in all subscales. Conclusion:Results confirm the initial hypothesis of the study: the BCI seems to be capable of providing as good rehabilitation as percutaneous devices for indicated patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{auditory}} brainstem implant (ABI) {{was first}} developed to help neurofibromatosis type 2 patients. Recently, its use has been recently extended to adults with non-tumor etiologies {{and children with}} profound hearing loss who were not candidates for a cochlear implant (Cl). Although the results has been extensively reported, the stimulation parameters involved behind the outcomes have received less attention. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the audiologic outcomes and the MAP parameters in ABI adults and children at our center. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Five adults and four children were implanted with the ABI 24 M from September 2005 to June 2009. In the adult patients, four had Neurofibromatosis type 2, and one had postmeningitic deafness with complete ossification of both cochleae. Three of the children had cochlear malformation or dysplasia, and one had complete ossified cochlea due to meningitis. Map parameters as well as the intraoperative electrical auditory brainstem responses were collected. Evaluation was performed with at least six months of device use and included free-field hearing thresholds, speech perception tests in the adult patients and for the children, the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and (ESP) were used to evaluate the development of auditory skills, besides the MUSS to evaluate. Results: The number of active electrodes that did not cause any non-auditory sensation varied from three to nineteen. All of them were programmed with SPEAK strategy, and the pulse widths varied from 100 to 300 mu s. Free-field thresholds with <b>warble</b> <b>tones</b> varied from very soft auditory sensation of 70 dBHL at 250 Hz to a pure tone average of 45 dBHL. Speech perception varied from none to 60 % open-set recognition of sentences in silence in the adult population and from no auditory sensation at all to a slight improvement in the IT-MAIS/MAIS scores. Conclusion: We observed that ABI may be a good option for offering some hearing attention to both adults and children. In children, the results might not be enough to ensure oral language development. Programming the speech processor in children demands higher care to the audiologist. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5000|$|Though the band's style can be broadly {{categorized}} as blending elements of death metal or black metal, critics {{have noted the}} band's unconventional approach to these genres. In a review of their 2013 EP Aura, Sputnikmusic wrote that the band are extending the genre's boundaries, and described the band as [...] "an adventurous extreme metal hybrid" [...] that is [...] "filtered through a veil of demented/majestic psychedelia, early ‘90s, muddy blast-beat death/black metal succeeds and it’s succeeded by abysmal doom metal passages." [...] NPR Music compared the EP to Celtic Frost and Incantation, [...] "fuelled by scrolls of complex riffs and drawn to doom." [...] Stereogum write that the band [...] "draws from a different palette than most, with songs that buzz with otherwordly weirdness at much as they rip, {{thanks in large part}} to a <b>warbling</b> guitar <b>tone</b> and keyboards that push out big atonal and symphonic blasts". Lyrically the band draw on mythological themes, ancient cultures, folklore, Nietzsche, and paganism. Okoi Jones has cited psychedelics as an influence on the band's music, and described the band's philosophy as [...] "all about getting out what we’re feeling. There’s no conformity involved as far as genres—black metal, death metal, whatever. I just write riffs that feel right to me. They’re usually based around atmosphere and power. The songs definitely have to move me. If the riff isn’t doing that, if it’s not giving me goose bumps, I’m not gonna use it. The goal is elevation—bodily and spiritual elevation." ...|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{national}} survey on sound field usage and sound field calibration are presented. The {{purposes of this study}} are: (1) to describe and analyze sound field stimuli, sound field test conditions, and sound field calibration procedures currently employed by audiologists nationwide, and (2) to investigate the extent of agreement between current practice and suggested practice from the current literature. Respondents to the survey were 418 ASHA certified audiologists, who answered questions on demographic variables, sound field testing conditions, and sound field calibration procedures. Eighty-one percent of the respondents use sound field audiometry as part of their audiological practice. Demographic characteristics of the respondents indicate that they were representative of the population of ASHA certified audiologists. Most respondents use two loudspeakers for sound field testing and use <b>warbled</b> pure <b>tones</b> for the stimuli. Forty-two different models of audiometers are in use, although three models account for over one-half of the responses. Electroacoustic calibration of the sound field stimuli is done most often by an equipment technician, and {{only a small percentage of}} the respondents knew how the calibration was done. No pattern of significant interactions was found among the calibration methods, sound field test conditions, and demographic variables of the subjects. Results show a lack of standardization among sound field test rooms, great diversity in the stimuli used for sound field testing, and inconsistent calibration methods. Results therefore indicate the need for national standards and improved pre-service and in-service training in sound field testing and sound field calibration techniques. Recommendations for clinical practice in sound field testing and sound field calibration are proposed...|$|R
