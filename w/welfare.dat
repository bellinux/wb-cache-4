5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two <b>welfare</b> reform {{bills that}} Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the <b>welfare</b> system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over <b>welfare</b> delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on <b>welfare</b> assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the <b>welfare</b> system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant <b>welfare</b> assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} <b>welfare</b> system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on <b>welfare,</b> and proclaimed that Congress could pass a <b>welfare</b> reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their <b>welfare</b> legislation.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish <b>welfare</b> state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's <b>welfare</b> state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish <b>welfare</b> state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the <b>welfare</b> state, by focusing on getting people off <b>welfare</b> benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public <b>welfare</b> system.|$|E

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the <b>welfare</b> system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} <b>welfare</b> fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of <b>welfare</b> fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in <b>welfare</b> programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|In May 1966, Imelda {{pushed through}} with campaigning for social <b>welfare.</b> Her {{plan was to}} pool {{together}} all the social <b>welfare</b> efforts of several dozen social <b>welfare</b> groups. Imelda wanted to build <b>welfare</b> villages {{to meet the needs}} of children with problems, and reorient a personnel to staff the villages. The scheme called for 12 million pesos. In November 1966, the cornerstone for the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid. Until 1968, other villages were built: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children's Orphanage in Pasay City, the Molave Village in Tanay, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at the Manila International Airport.|$|E

5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see <b>welfare</b> state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of <b>welfare</b> may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State <b>welfare</b> without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on <b>welfare</b> payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state <b>welfare</b> does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional <b>welfare</b> does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the <b>welfare</b> of farm animals. Possible measures of <b>welfare</b> include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal <b>welfare</b> have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
