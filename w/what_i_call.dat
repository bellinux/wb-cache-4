5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} record label is Virgin Records, who have released eight Christmas number one albums.

From 14 January 1989, compilation albums featuring various artists were no longer included in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, the BBC Top of the Pops brand {{was again}} {{licensed}} {{for use in}} a tie-in compilation series. Starting in 1995 with Sony Music's Columbia Records label, these double disc collections moved to the special marketing arm of PolyGram / Universal Music Group TV, before becoming a sister brand of the Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music! range in the EMI / Virgin / Universal joint venture.|$|E
25|$|A {{music video}} for the single, which was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, was released along with the single released. It features Spears dancing in a sauna. Spears' performance of the song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City was highly criticized by animal rights group PETA {{for the inclusion of}} exotic animals. Spears performed the song on every tour since its release, including the promotional The M+M's Tour. The song was also featured on the 2002 compilation album Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music! 9.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1968 and {{carrying}} {{on through the}} 1970s a rival series of Top of the Pops albums were produced, however these had no connection with the television series except for its name. They were a series of budget cover albums of current chart hits recorded by anonymous session singers and musicians released on the Hallmark record label. They had initially reached the charts but were later disallowed due {{to a change in}} the criteria for entering the charts. These albums continued to be produced until the early 1980s, when the advent of compilation albums featuring the original versions of hits, such as the Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music! series, led to a steep decline in their popularity.|$|E
60|$|I believe hope {{had died}} in me long ago of {{reconciliation}} in this world. Strange, that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>called</b> 'unkindness' for so many years, in departing should have left to me such a sudden desolation! And yet, it is not strange, perhaps.|$|R

60|$|There {{were times}} when I walked weeping through that {{brightness}} that was neither night nor day. There {{were times when}} I reasoned in a topsy-turvy fashion with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>called</b> the Spirit of All Things. But always I spoke to that white glory in the sky.|$|R
25|$|On February 8, 2013, Warner Music Group {{acquired}} the Parlophone Music Group (consisting of Parlophone Records, Chrysalis Records, EMI Classics, Virgin Classics and EMI Records' Belgian, Czech, Danish, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Slovak and Swedish divisions) for $765million (£487million).

500|$|The {{following}} Robin Thicke parody [...] "Word Crimes" [...] {{involves the}} singer pointing out grammatical errors frequently made in online messages, and shaming people {{who engage in}} various other common textual misconceptions. [...] "My Own Eyes" [...] is a style parody of the Foo Fighters in which the protagonist recalls witnessing unusual events throughout his life, such as elderly men dying of [...] "Bieber fever" [...] and a mime [...] "hacked to death with an imaginary cleaver". Partridge felt that the pastiche [...] "falls flat" [...] without Dave Grohl's songwriting and personality. [...] "Now That's <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Polka!" [...] is Yankovic's twelfth polka medley, in which Yankovic sings selections of various popular songs {{at the time of}} recording, set to a polka music.

500|$|Rutherford's {{deep concern}} with propriety and {{feminine}} modesty should not obscure {{the fact that}} the school prepared women for more than traditional domestic roles. Lucy Cobb recognized that many of its alumnae would seek employment, and by teaching students marketable, and at the same time, respectable, skills, as well as genteel decorum and dress, Lucy Cobb created a new image of elite white single womanhood that combined aspects of the new woman and the southern belle, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> the [...] "new belle."
