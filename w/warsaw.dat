5|$|At age {{eighteen}} Margaret {{moved to}} <b>Warsaw,</b> where (as of June 2016) {{she lives in}} a Śródmieście apartment. She began an English studies degree at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in <b>Warsaw,</b> but left after three semesters. Margaret earned a degree in fashion design from the International School of Costume and Fashion Design in <b>Warsaw</b> in 2015.|$|E
5|$|From the north, <b>Warsaw,</b> which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering {{equipment for the}} river crossings inhibited a flanking attack of <b>Warsaw</b> from the west, which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike <b>Warsaw</b> from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the <b>Warsaw</b> Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from <b>Warsaw</b> in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} fight for <b>Warsaw</b> {{became one of the}} icons of Polish culture, {{described}} by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. It was also the main inspiration behind Chopin's Revolutionary Étude, initially called the Étude on the Bombardment of <b>Warsaw.</b> The fall of <b>Warsaw</b> also garnered sympathy for the Poles and their quest for independence.|$|E
5|$|Many {{monuments to}} the Home Army {{have since been}} erected in Poland, {{including}} the Polish Underground State and Home Army Monument near the Sejm building in <b>Warsaw,</b> unveiled in 1999. The Home Army is also commemorated in the Home Army Museum in Kraków and in the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising Museum in <b>Warsaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|A plaque commemorating Wallenberg was {{unveiled}} in downtown <b>Warsaw</b> {{on the occasion}} of naming a city street after him. The unveiling ceremony was part of commemorations marking the 73rd anniversary of the start of the <b>Warsaw</b> Ghetto Uprising.|$|E
5|$|A {{shield and}} sword-wielding mermaid (Syrenka) {{is on the}} {{official}} coat of arms of <b>Warsaw.</b> Images of a mermaid have symbolized <b>Warsaw</b> on its arms {{since the middle of}} the 14th century. Several legends associate Triton of Greek mythology with the city, which may have been the origin of the mermaid's association.|$|E
5|$|Additional Polish forces, about 8,000 strong, were to {{concentrate}} in <b>Warsaw</b> under command of King Poniatowski as reserve.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the <b>Warsaw</b> Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of <b>Warsaw.</b> Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War the <b>Warsaw</b> Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a <b>Warsaw</b> Pact-wide campaign {{to wipe out the}} beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E
5|$|Finally, a {{delegation}} of about 27workers was sent to <b>Warsaw</b> around June23. On the night of June26, the delegation returned to Poznań, confident {{that some of their}} demands had been considered in a favourable light. The Minister of Machine Industry met with the workers next morning and withdrew several promises that their delegation was given in <b>Warsaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{has written}} of his Jewish parents' {{experiences}} during World War II. His mother, Maryla Husyt, {{grew up in}} <b>Warsaw,</b> survived the <b>Warsaw</b> Ghetto, the Majdanek concentration camp, and two slave labor camps. Her first husband died in the war. She considered {{the day of her}} liberation as the most horrible day of her life, as she realized that she was alone, her parents and siblings gone. Norman's father, Zacharias Finkelstein, active in Hashomer Hatzair, was a survivor of both the <b>Warsaw</b> Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Having {{defeated}} von Rosen at Międzyrzec on 29 August, Ramorino's {{forces were}} ordered to return to Siedlce, but Ramorino disregarded that order and followed von Rosen towards Brześć. The order to return through Łuków to Siedlce was repeated on 4 September. From there, a forced march could allow the II Corps to cross the Vistula {{to the south of}} <b>Warsaw</b> and attack Paskevich from the rear, or rejoin the bulk of the Polish Army defending <b>Warsaw.</b> The repeated order was also ignored. A large part of the Polish forces, composed mostly of seasoned soldiers, high in morale thanks to recent victories, was wandering aimlessly through Podlasie, only a couple of days' march from <b>Warsaw.</b> Instead of coming to the aid of <b>Warsaw</b> or following the fleeing forces of von Rosen, Ramorino waited in Podlasie for a week, and then headed south, away from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|He co-founded the <b>Warsaw</b> Society of Friends of Learning (precursor to the Polish Academy of Sciences), {{of which}} he became president. He served {{as a member of}} the State Council of the Duchy of <b>Warsaw</b> and as {{minister}} of trade and industry in Congress Poland. Staszic is seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, Tatra Mountains studies and exploration, mining and industry.|$|E
5|$|He {{entered the}} Imperial University of <b>Warsaw</b> in 1902, but was soon {{expelled}} after {{taking part in}} protests against the Russian administration's curtailment of student rights. Threatened with conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, he chose to emigrate and in early 1904 left <b>Warsaw</b> for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} honorary doctorate {{degrees from}} <b>Warsaw</b> University (1958), Wrocław Medical Academy (1961), Poznań University (1963) and Wrocław University (1965).|$|E
5|$|He {{spend much}} of his fortune on {{political}} activism, and was nearly bankrupt {{by the time of}} his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of <b>Warsaw.</b> It is likely that major reasons he preferred not to have been elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in <b>Warsaw.</b> He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and his large funeral was paid for by the City of <b>Warsaw.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1912, the <b>Warsaw</b> Scientific Society {{offered her}} the {{directorship}} {{of a new}} laboratory in <b>Warsaw</b> but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute {{to be completed in}} August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in <b>Warsaw</b> but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, after Poland had regained her independence, Sienkiewicz's {{remains were}} repatriated to <b>Warsaw,</b> Poland, {{and placed in}} the crypt of St. John's Cathedral. During the coffin's transit, solemn {{memorial}} ceremonies were held in a number of cities. Thousands accompanied the coffin to its <b>Warsaw</b> resting place, and Poland's President Stanisław Wojciechowski delivered a eulogy.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, a {{memorial}} in Johannesburg commemorates {{the victims of}} Katyn, as well as South African and Polish airmen who flew missions from southern Italy to Poland in order to drop supplies over <b>Warsaw</b> during the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Warsaw,</b> {{there were}} over 70underground schools, with 2,000teachers and 21,000 students. Underground <b>Warsaw</b> University educated 3,700students, issuing 64 masters and 7doctoral degrees. <b>Warsaw</b> Politechnic under {{occupation}} educated 3,000students, issuing 186engineering degrees, 18doctoral ones and 16habilitations. Jagiellonian University issued 468masters and 62doctoral degrees, employed over 100professors and teachers, and served more than 1,000students per year. Throughout Poland, many other universities and {{institutions of higher education}} (of music, theater, arts, and others) continued their classes throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, Raw was {{transferred}} to Egypt and undertook an operational conversion course that prepared him to fly Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers in combat. In July that year he was posted to No. 178 Squadron RAF, a British B-24 Liberator unit based near Foggia in southern Italy. While serving with this squadron, Raw took part in operations in the eastern Mediterranean region as well as Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia. During August 1944 the long-range bomber units controlled by No. 205 Group RAF, including No. 178 Squadron, undertook several risky operations {{as part of the}} <b>Warsaw</b> airlift to supply the Polish Home Army during the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising. Raw participated in three of these flights. His bomber was the only aircraft to deliver its cargo to <b>Warsaw</b> during a mission on 16August; Raw subsequently received the Polish Cross of Valour in February 1945 for this achievement. One of his other flights to <b>Warsaw</b> was conducted on 1September, but due to bad weather Raw was unable to see the city at the time he dropped the load of supplies.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers. On 1 August 1944, when the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in <b>Warsaw</b> were armed.|$|E
5|$|Later {{the same}} month, on October 25, the allies {{made a quick}} push to destroy the bridge going over the Vistula, from <b>Warsaw</b> to Praga, in order {{to slow down the}} Swedish troop movements. However, the attack was repulsed by a handful of men. A month later, on November 28, Sweden and Poland made peace in the Treaty of <b>Warsaw</b> through the <b>Warsaw</b> Confederation which {{increased}} Sweden's position even further. Charles could now march, after having waited more than a year since Augustus was dethroned, against the Russian army under Ogilvy which had already by this time reached Grodno.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski left <b>Warsaw</b> in July 1944 {{with his}} mother, merely {{a few days}} before the <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising, {{salvaging}} only a few scores and sketches—the rest of his music was lost during the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the fall of uprising, as were the family's Drozdowo estates. Of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski's Paganini Variations survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of <b>Warsaw</b> after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski started {{piano lessons}} in <b>Warsaw</b> {{for two years}} {{from the age of}} six. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left <b>Warsaw</b> to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother {{returned}} to <b>Warsaw.</b> She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the <b>Warsaw</b> Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at <b>Warsaw</b> University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's Toccata and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} centenary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an allegorical mural was {{painted on the}} façade of her <b>Warsaw</b> birthplace. It depicts an infant Maria Skłodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the {{elements}} that she would discover as an adult: polonium and radium. Also in 2011, a new <b>Warsaw</b> bridge over the Vistula was named in her honor.|$|E
5|$|Only {{five days}} later, on July 31, Paykull reached the {{outskirts}} of <b>Warsaw</b> with his army and in a surprise attack attempted to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław. In the ensuing battle of <b>Warsaw</b> the much smaller Swedish force under Carl Nieroth guarding the city won a decisive victory. Paykull was captured along with secret documents which informed the Swedes of a possible attack on <b>Warsaw</b> by a larger Russian army under Peter.|$|E
5|$|Prince Józef Zajączek (1 November 1752, Kamieniec Podolski — 28 August 1826, <b>Warsaw)</b> was a Polish {{general and}} politician.|$|E
5|$|Robinson Crusoes of <b>Warsaw</b> {{were people}} who, {{after the end}} of the 1944 <b>Warsaw</b> Uprising and the {{subsequent}} planned destruction of <b>Warsaw</b> by Nazi Germany, decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city. The period of hiding spanned as long as three and a half months, from the day of the capitulation of the uprising, October 2, 1944, until the entry of the Red Army on January 17, 1945. Most of the Robinsons were Jews, although a considerable number of non-Jewish Poles were also present. The hideaways lived in the ruins of houses, basements, and bunkers which had been prepared ahead of time. They lived in extremely dire circumstances, while the city was being destroyed around them. Some managed to escape <b>Warsaw,</b> many were captured and killed by the Germans, while others survived until the withdrawal of German troops.|$|E

5|$|The {{first phase}} of the battle began on August 13 with a frontal assault by the Red Army on the Praga bridgehead. The Soviet forces {{captured}} Radzymin on August 14 and breached the lines of the 1st Polish Army, which was defending <b>Warsaw</b> from the east. Radzymin changed hands several times in heavy combat. Foreign diplomats, {{with the exception of the}} British and Vatican ambassadors, hastily left <b>Warsaw.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} evening Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich {{entered the}} city leading his Imperial Guard; <b>Warsaw</b> capitulated.|$|E
5|$|The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to fight a}} major battle. Instead, he ordered <b>Warsaw</b> to be fortified and allowed the Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the war could only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed <b>Warsaw</b> would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact to fight a decisive battle against the Russians, who by then would be cut off from their rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki {{was forced to resign}} and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of <b>Warsaw.</b>|$|E
