It is cost effective and it provides a very fast production rate of automotive body components.

Therefore they are prone to failure, if not designed properly, during their service life time. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the behaviour of <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> and their failure characteristics. Generally, before the manufacturing stage, most of the automotive structural components are designed and tested in a virtual design environment. It is important to examine the crashworthiness of these body-in-white structures. To asses the crashworthiness of these structures they need to be represented correctly in virtual simulations, which necessitate the development of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint models to be included in crash analysis. Usually the models for the body-in-white structures are complicated and huge, which contains thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints.

This investigation highlights the influence of rotational speed of the tool, and the effect of position of the interface with respect to the tool axis on tensile strength of the friction stir spot welded joint. The axial load is constant between the tool shoulder and the surface of the base material. The rotational speed of the tool axis is continuously changed by keeping the axial load constant. It is found that there is an optimal axial load, above which the weld is defect-free, with joint efficiency of 84 % for Al alloy generally. There is a tolerance for interface position; i. e., the tool can be allowed to deviate away from the interface without deteriorating joint efficiency of the weld. The tool can be allowed to deviate from the interface in either side, but the tolerance is higher when the interface is located in the around the tool. Mechanical testing of the spot weld lap joints was performed utilizing the tension-shear configuration. And also evaluate the hardness on the <b>weld</b> <b>spot</b> at the different zone nugget, TMAZ, HAZ and Base plate. Two primary functions that the FSSW tool has serves: (a) heating of work-piece, and (b) movement of material around pin to produce the joint.

The first eight objectives are elements that comprise the Optoelectronic Packaging Interfaces for Sub-Micron Alignment (OPISA) project. The final objective is the dissemination of this work. Finite element models were developed and used with design of experiments (DoE) statistical technique. This was used to investigate how the key process parameters influence the resultant stress in the optical fibre and to develop a predictive surrogate model. The surrogate model was used with Monte Carlo simulations to determine the fibre stress variation when uncertainty and variation of the design variables are accounted for. The Monte Carlo simulations predicted fibre stress response values which were used to understand how the uncertainties of the input design variables propagate into uncertainty and variation of fibre stress. The surrogate model was used in a sensitivity and risk analysis. The capability analysis of the welding process was also investigated. The original finding of this work is the development of a methodology that fulfils the aim. The work successfully demonstrated that the current industry <b>weld</b> <b>spot</b> location generate 180 MPa of post weld stress in the optical fibre. Using the OPISA methodology the optimal weld locations generate 57. 6 MPa of post weld stress in the optical fibre...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of other joining methods such as laser beam welding, bolted, riveted, and adhesive bonding, resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> (RSW) remains the primary method to join panels especially in automotive, railroad, and airplane structures, which contain hundreds, even thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> In service, mechanical components usually experience cyclic loading. This makes fatigue failure prevention the foremost design requirement. Considering that <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> provide localized connection, they lead to stress concentration and consequently to initiation of fatigue cracks. The designer should {{then be able to}} predict the fatigue life of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints and determine the impact of design changes on fatigue resistance. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of design parameters for <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints on their fatigue life. For this purpose, stress analyses of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> plates were carried out using a finite element method for various plate geometries and <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> diameters. Based on the predicted stress and strain states, fatigue life analyses were performed. The results of this study will provide the designer with some guidelines in designing <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints...|$|R

Soon enough, mechanical arms were being passed down to additional car companies.|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} spot wells are used especially in automotive and airplane industry-for example, a car body contains approximately 5000 <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> and this <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> numbers reach to 15000 {{in a bus}} or coach body according to contraction engineers- because of its simplicity, low cost and of course reliability (which are significant aspects of manufacturing processes) to the other type of joining techniques like rivet joint, bolted joint and bonded joint. In this point, {{it can be said}} that the integrity of the resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> determines the overall structural rigidity and integrity of the vehicle. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanical behavior of <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> under representative types of loading conditions and the life predictions of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> specimens...|$|R
