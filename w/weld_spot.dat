It is cost effective and it provides a very fast production rate of automotive body components. Despite this advantage, <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> are very susceptible to various types of loading conditions. Therefore they are prone to failure, if not designed properly, during their service life time. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the behaviour of <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> and their failure characteristics. Generally, before the manufacturing stage, most of the automotive structural components are designed and tested in a virtual design environment. It is important to examine the crashworthiness of these body-in-white structures. To asses the crashworthiness of these structures they need to be represented correctly in virtual simulations, which necessitate the development of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint models to be included in crash analysis. Usually the models for the body-in-white structures are complicated and huge, which contains thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints. Therefore a simple model for <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints is desirable. Six different <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joint models were developed in this thesis to serve the above mentioned purpose.

40|$|Friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) can be {{considered}} for many of the applications presently performed with traditional resistance spot welding (RSW), the basic concept of FSSW is remarkably simple. This investigation highlights the influence of rotational speed of the tool, and the effect of position of the interface with respect to the tool axis on tensile strength of the friction stir spot welded joint. The axial load is constant between the tool shoulder and the surface of the base material. The rotational speed of the tool axis is continuously changed by keeping the axial load constant. It is found that there is an optimal axial load, above which the weld is defect-free, with joint efficiency of 84 % for Al alloy generally. There is a tolerance for interface position; i. e., the tool can be allowed to deviate away from the interface without deteriorating joint efficiency of the weld. The tool can be allowed to deviate from the interface in either side, but the tolerance is higher when the interface is located in the around the tool. Mechanical testing of the spot weld lap joints was performed utilizing the tension-shear configuration. And also evaluate the hardness on the <b>weld</b> <b>spot</b> at the different zone nugget, TMAZ, HAZ and Base plate. Two primary functions that the FSSW tool has serves: (a) heating of work-piece, and (b) movement of material around pin to produce the joint. The heating is accomplished due to the friction between the work-piece and tool and plastic deformation of work piece has taken place. The combined effect of localized heating, tool rotation and axial load, softens the material around the pin. That is why it is called a âsolid state â welding process.

40|$|For {{optoelectronic}} devices submicron precision {{is required}} to optimally couple the laser source with the optical fibre. Laser welding is used because of its inherent attributes of accuracy, strength, cleanliness and minimised heat affected zone and structural changes. Due to the rapid solidification of the welded parts post welding residual stresses occur {{which can lead to}} a post weld shift between the aligned components and can significantly reduce the light coupling efficiency. Submicron misalignment induced due to the welding process can result in significant power loss. This is a serious and common issue in the manufacture of optoelectronic components and affects production rates. The aim of this work is the development of a methodology that can estimate the residual stresses in the weld piece and to optimise the process by locating the optimal site for micro laser welding. The aim establishes the research question which was addressed by nine objectives. The first eight objectives are elements that comprise the Optoelectronic Packaging Interfaces for Sub-Micron Alignment (OPISA) project. The final objective is the dissemination of this work. Finite element models were developed and used with design of experiments (DoE) statistical technique. This was used to investigate how the key process parameters influence the resultant stress in the optical fibre and to develop a predictive surrogate model. The surrogate model was used with Monte Carlo simulations to determine the fibre stress variation when uncertainty and variation of the design variables are accounted for. The Monte Carlo simulations predicted fibre stress response values which were used to understand how the uncertainties of the input design variables propagate into uncertainty and variation of fibre stress. The surrogate model was used in a sensitivity and risk analysis. The capability analysis of the welding process was also investigated. The original finding of this work is the development of a methodology that fulfils the aim. The work successfully demonstrated that the current industry <b>weld</b> <b>spot</b> location generate 180 MPa of post weld stress in the optical fibre. Using the OPISA methodology the optimal weld locations generate 57. 6 MPa of post weld stress in the optical fibre...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of other joining methods such as laser beam welding, bolted, riveted, and adhesive bonding, resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> (RSW) remains the primary method to join panels especially in automotive, railroad, and airplane structures, which contain hundreds, even thousands of <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> In service, mechanical components usually experience cyclic loading.
