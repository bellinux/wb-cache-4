2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{three of the}} six Cities of Refuge were to be {{designated}} east of the Jordan, {{and the other three}} were to be designated in the land of Canaan. The Cities of Refuge were to serve as places to which a slayer who had killed a person unintentionally could flee from the avenger, so that the slayer might not die without a trial before the assembly. Anyone, however, who struck and killed another with an iron object, stone tool, or wood tool was to be considered a murderer, and was to be put to death. The blood-avenger was to put the murderer to death upon encounter. Similarly, if the killer pushed or struck the victim by hand in hate or hurled something at the victim on purpose and death resulted, the assailant was to be put to death as a murderer. But if the slayer pushed the victim <b>without</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> hurled an object at the victim unintentionally, or inadvertently dropped on the victim any deadly object of stone, and death resulted — without the victim being an enemy of the slayer and without the slayer seeking the victim harm — then the assembly was to decide between the slayer and the blood-avenger. The assembly was to protect the slayer from the blood-avenger, and the assembly was to restore the slayer to the city of refuge to which the slayer fled, and there the slayer was to remain until the death of the high priest. But if the slayer ever left the city of refuge, and the blood-avenger came upon the slayer outside the city limits, then there would be no bloodguilt if the blood-avenger killed the slayer. The slayer was to remain inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest, after which the slayer could return to his land. A slayer could be executed only on the evidence of more than one witness. The Israelites were not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer guilty of a capital crime; the murderer was to be put to death. Similarly, the Israelites were not to accept ransom in lieu of flight to a city of refuge, enabling a slayer to return to live on the slayer's land before the death of the high priest. Bloodshed polluted the land, and only the blood of the one who shed it could make expiation for the bloodshed.|$|E
5000|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} is the unlawful {{killing of}} a human being <b>without</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought,</b> either expressed or implied.

50|$|In 1981, {{newspaper}} reporters {{learned that}} Carter {{had been convicted}} of murder <b>without</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> fifty years earlier in Laredo, Texas, following the death of 15-year-old Ramón Casiano. The then 17-year-old Carter had believed that Casiano had information about the theft of his family's car, and, carrying a shotgun, asked Casiano to return to the Carter home to submit to questioning. When Casiano refused, and then brandished a knife, Carter fatally shot him. The conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Appeals, which found that the judge in the case had issued incorrect jury instructions regarding laws related to self-defense. In 1981, when newspaper reporters learned of the conviction, Carter initially denied any knowledge of the incident but later acknowledged that he had been responsible for the shooting.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the criminal liability}} of the doctor and brings more clearly into focus the causal connection between the actions or omissions <b>without</b> <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> performed by the doctor and the detrimental or deadly event suffered by the patient. The question at issue has been largely debated by the United Sections of the Criminal Court that pronunced itself on the well-known leading case Franzese in 2002. In the first instance, I ana-lyse {{the most important and}} innovative profiles of this pronunciation, trying to highlight the critical points. The thesis’s central part consists in examining the jurisprudence of the Criminal Court of Cassation from 2002 to 2010, in order to verify whether the principles dictated by the United Sections have been incorporated and applied in point of fact both by the Court of legitimacy and by that of merits. It must be underlined that, {{in spite of the fact}} that some sentences have made use of those principles actually and essentially, there are others that have made only a simple and formal reference to those principles, diminishing substantially their practical application. In addition to the case law analysis, I give an account of the most in-fluential doctrinal contributions. These are useful for forecasting the nearest future developments of this subject. ...|$|E

[...] Manslaughter was defined by Shaw as [...] "the unlawful killing of another without malice".

5000|$|<b>Malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> is {{no longer}} {{regarded}} as a necessary mens rea element to prove a murder conviction. The term is a catch-all phrase that encompasses all the states of mind that are sufficient mens rea [...] for murder. Most Australian jurisdictions require some degree of actual awareness of the resulting consequences of the accused's own actions to justify a murder conviction. The High Court of Australia affirmed {{that there is a}} spectrum of mens rea ranging from intention to kill to reckless indifference that would be relevant in securing a murder conviction. However, the High Court ruled that it was not necessary to prove <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> in a manslaughter conviction. The Full Court in Victoria distinguished between the two classes of manslaughter. They were manslaughter by reckless indifference and manslaughter by criminal negligence in R v Nydam in which <b>malice</b> <b>aforethought</b> was definitively ruled out as an element in a charge of manslaughter by criminal negligence.|$|R
