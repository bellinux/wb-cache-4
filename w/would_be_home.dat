5|$|By 1966, {{the shops}} had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at {{the expense of}} {{demolishing}} an area of Victorian, Georgian and Tudor buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed), and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking. The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate, and Old Market, severed from Bristol's shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass {{and the destruction of}} Castle Street, was in serious decline. The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter's Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest Bristol Bridge would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.|$|E

25|$|Wagner {{moved to}} the Parichy Bloomer Girls of the National Girls Baseball League (NGBL) in 1950, because she was offered a higher salary, a signing bonus and no {{extensive}} travelling. Audrey only contemplated moving to the NGBL due to a disagreement with management. Additionally, the games were played in the Chicago area, so she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> every night closer to school and her studies. Whereas the AAGPBL gradually evolved from softball to an almost standard hardball, with longer bases and sidearm or overhand pitching, the NGBL used a ball larger than that used in the AAGPBL, featured the traditional underhand pitching and base paths stayed shorter.|$|E

When Fred arrived, he informed his family of his intentions to voluntarily offer a witness statement to police regarding his daughter's whereabouts. Despite Fred's insistence in this statement that Heather had been [...] "alive and well", albeit involved in a drugs cartel, and that the claims {{he and his wife}} had made as to Heather being buried beneath the family patio were simply [...] "rubbish", police were unassuaged. In response, Fred abruptly changed tactics, claiming they simply held a grudge against him due to his 1993 acquittal of the rape of his daughter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1715, pirates {{launched}} a major raid on Spanish divers {{trying to recover}} gold from a sunken treasure galleon near Florida. [...] The nucleus of the pirate force {{was a group of}} English ex-privateers, all of whom would soon be enshrined in infamy: Henry Jennings, Charles Vane, Samuel Bellamy, and Edward England. The attack was successful, but contrary to their expectations, the governor of Jamaica refused to allow Jennings and their cohorts to spend their loot on his island. With Kingston and the declining Port Royal closed to them, Jennings and his comrades founded a new pirate base at Nassau, on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas, which had been abandoned during the war. Until the arrival of governor Woodes Rogers three years later, Nassau <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> for these pirates and their many recruits.|$|E

2500|$|Wes Beech took {{a sabbatical}} for {{personal}} reasons and would not tour with the band on the next tour. The band {{decided to return to}} being a 3-Piece. Wes came in as Associate Producer with Rod on the album and worked on writing, arranging and recording, but the recording would be Michael, TC, and Greg (who would go on to play with Alice Cooper, Ritchie Blackmore and others and who had been brought in as the touring bassist for the WOW album). There was tremendous excitement in tackling the project a kind of minimalist, stripped down concept, or rite of purification. The songs, including the lyrics, would also be minimalistic or archetypal again giving Wendy a chance to take her vocals step further. The tempo of the WOW album had been slower than previous albums in an effort to open it up, but the new album Kommander of Kaos (a.k.a. KOK) was to bring back the speed and then some. Songs would be played at breakneck speeds, with screaming leads and vocals. The recording was done in Fairfield NJ at the giant Broccoli Rabe Recording complex which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> to numerous Wendy O./Plasmatics Projects including three studio albums with what the group fondly called [...] "The Fairfield Sound".|$|E
