5|$|The work {{opened to}} the public in Chicago on October 22, 1883, to {{critical}} acclaim. General John Gibbon, one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> favorable reviews. So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.|$|E
5|$|Claridge's {{was founded}} in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel on Brook Street. It was {{acquired}} by William Claridge in 1855, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> its current name. The hotel was bought by the Savoy Company in 1895 and rebuilt in a red brick design, and extended again in 1931. Several European royal families in exile stayed at the hotel during World War II. Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia was born at the hotel on 17 July 1945; the Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{is said to have}} declared the suite he was born in to be Yugoslav territory.|$|E

5|$|Shemanski Fountain, {{also known}} as Rebecca at the Well, is an outdoor {{fountain}} with a bronze sculpture, located in the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The sandstone fountain was designed in 1925, completed in 1926, and named after Joseph Shemanski, a Polish immigrant and businessman <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to the city. Carl L. Linde designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which {{was added to the}} fountain in 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca. Shemanski Fountain includes two drinking platforms with three basins each, with one platform intended for use by dogs.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} for this species was {{collected from the}} Port Jackson area (Sydney district) and was described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the specific epithet juniperina which alludes to its juniper-like foliage. Likewise it {{is commonly known as}} juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea, as well as prickly spider-flower. The lectotype was selected by Don MacGillivray in 1993 from a collection by George Caley in 1803 11km (7mi) northwest of Prospect in what is now Sydney's outer western suburbs. Brown placed it in the series Lissostylis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is more likely that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1729, by the Italian Pier Antonio Micheli in his Nova plantarum genera iuxta Tournefortii methodum disposita, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> its current scientific name. The species was once {{referred to by}} American authors as Clathrus cancellatus L., as they used a system of nomenclature based on the former American Code of Botanical Nomenclature, in which {{the starting point for}} naming species was Linnaeus's 1753 Species Plantarum. The International Code for Botanical Nomenclature now uses the same starting date, but names of Gasteromycetes used by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his Synopsis Methodica Fungorum (1801) are sanctioned and automatically replace earlier names. Since Persoon used the specific epithet ruber, the correct name for the species is Clathrus ruber. Several historical names of the fungus are now synonyms: Clathrus flavescens, named by Persoon in 1801; Clathrus cancellatus by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and published by Elias Fries in 1823; Clathrus nicaeensis, published by Jean-Baptiste Barla in 1879; and Clathrus ruber var. flavescens, published by Livio Quadraccia and Dario Lunghini in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby {{was seen}} in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by {{survivors}} of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by François Pelsaert in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie. It was first described in 1817 by the French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> the name eugenii based on where it was found; an island he knew as Ile Eugene in the Nuyts Archipelago off South Australia which is now known as St Peter Island. The island's French name was given in honour of Eugene Hamelin, commander of the ship Naturaliste; whose name is now the specific name of the tammar. The common name of the animal is derived from the thickets of the shrub locally known as tamma (Allocasuarina campestris) that sheltered it in Western Australia. The tammar is classified together with the kangaroos, wallaroos and several species of wallaby in the genus Macropus, and in the subgenus Notamacropus with the other wallabies, all of which have a facial stripe.|$|E

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
