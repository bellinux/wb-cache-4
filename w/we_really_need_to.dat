500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
500|$|The New Yorkers David Denby {{felt the}} new version of Hairspray was [...] "perfectly pleasant," [...] but {{compared}} unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since [...] " [...] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor." [...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But do <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly {{to make sense of}} that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, {{but it was}} never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads [...] "Cash Loan" [...] in a red font, followed by [...] "Buy · Sell · Trade" [...] in a green font below. The ladies sport [...] "'80s hairstyles", to which a critic from Spin predicted was in an attempt [...] "to rival some of the best videos from two decades ago". Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled [...] "8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos That <b>We</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Need</b> <b>To</b> See". Rosa noted that the video [...] "is now virtually unfindable on the Web", and was disappointed by stating: [...] "We wanted some Madonna realness, Gwen!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Topher's {{arrival and}} {{induction}} into {{the group was}} not entirely well received, with reviewer Paul Brian McCoy mentioning [...] "I don’t think <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> introduce new characters yet since <b>we</b> still don’t <b>really</b> know who these kids and their parents are." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brownstein has {{referred}} to the album as a [...] "strident and pointed political record, {{in terms of the}} lyrics". The album contains some of Sleater-Kinney's most polemical songs; [...] "Far Away" [...] explicitly references the September 11 terrorist attacks and contains criticism of American president George W. Bush. Corin Tucker said that it [...] "wasn't really a conscious decision" [...] to write about the attacks, but there was [...] "just such as an overwhelming presence in our minds as we were trying to write songs, that we felt that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> deal with it, and that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> write about it". The album's lyrics were also prominently influenced by the recent birth of Tucker's son Marshall Tucker Bangs. According to Tucker, [...] "Marshall is all over One Beat. The last year was definitely a difficult time for me, as he was born nine weeks premature and {{he was in the hospital}} for a while. It was the hardest thing that I've ever lived through, that fear and anxiety, and I think I was able to let go into the music." [...] The song [...] "Sympathy" [...] was written about the [...] "terrifying" [...] experience of Marshall's premature birth. [...] "Hollywood Ending" [...] attacks the concept of celebrity and the mainstream female body image.|$|R
2500|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major rewrite to the script. According to Hudlin, in the {{original}} draft, Eddie's character Marcus [...] "never decides anything, things are decided for him by the different women. So, we finally realized {{he had to make}} an affirmative choice. Going through the script with a buddy of mine, we talked about it, and my buddy Tre said 'look, he's got to make a decision.' And I said, 'you're right. He's got to reject her, and choose her.' And it seems so obvious now, I'm like 'what's wrong with me? What was wrong with all of us that it took us so long to figure out what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> do to fix the movie?' ...|$|R
500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with particular praise {{going to the}} song [...] "Something Entirely New" [...] and the voice acting by Estelle. Several critics favorably compared the episode to a fairy tale. Lyn Muldrow of Autostraddle said that Steven Universe had [...] "out-gayed" [...] itself with this episode. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club was somewhat critical of the episode, giving it a B+, and stating that it [...] "doesn’t really tell us anything we couldn’t have guessed, or anything that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> know". He also felt that Ruby and Sapphire were still one-note characters, not complex enough to compare to the other characters of the show. Sarra Sedghi of Paste listed [...] "Something Entirely New" [...] as the fifth best song of the show's first two seasons.|$|R
2500|$|The {{threat of}} climate change to the islands is not a {{dominant}} motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living in Tuvalu for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity. In 2013 Enele Sopoaga, {{the prime minister of}} Tuvalu, said that relocating Tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise [...] "should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself. For Tuvalu I think <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> mobilise public opinion in the Pacific {{as well as in the}} [...] world to really talk to their lawmakers to please have some sort of moral obligation and things like that to do the right thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|While some {{commentators}} {{have called for}} the relocation of Tuvalu's population to Australia, New Zealand or Kioa in Fiji, in 2006 Maatia Toafa (Prime Minister from 2004–2006) said his government did not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population {{would need to be}} evacuated. In 2013 Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, said that relocating Tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise [...] "should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself.

2500|$|With Thompson's {{decision}} {{to campaign for}} the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, his Senate record received some criticism from people who say he was [...] "lazy" [...] compared to other Senators. Critics say that few of his proposals became law, and point to a 1998 quote: [...] "I don't like spending 14- and 16-hour days voting on 'sense of the Senate' resolutions on irrelevant matters. There are some important things <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get on with—and on a daily basis, it's very frustrating." [...] Defenders say he spent more time in preparation than other Senators. Paul Noe, a former staffer, told The New York Times, [...] "On the lazy charge, I have to chuckle because I was there sometimes until 1 in the morning working with the man." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Billion Tree Campaign was {{inspired}} by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai, founder of the Green Belt Movement. When an executive in the United States told Professor Maathai their corporation was planning to plant a million trees, her response was: [...] "That’s great, but what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is <b>to</b> plant a billion trees." [...] The campaign was carried out under the patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Daily Star, Avicii, who had previously labelled [...] "Wake Me Up!" [...] as [...] "a fun experiment" [...] during an exclusive chat with MTV UK, said: [...] "I had a demo with Mac Davis singing, the guy who wrote some songs that were covered by Elvis Presley , but I <b>needed</b> another singer <b>to</b> do the parts. At the same time I was tipped off about doing another track with Aloe Blacc, and I started working on that track. When I was with Mike Einziger from Incubus, we came up with the chord progression and the melody for 'Wake Me Up!' but with no real lyrics. None of us could sing and <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get that demo down and the only person I knew that lived in LA was Aloe, so I called him and he was free. Lyrics come really easy to him so the two of us wrote them {{in a couple of hours}} and we finished the track." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a January 4, 2007, {{appearance}} on The Situation Room, Webb articulated {{his position on}} the Iraq War: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do is to get into the arena where we can talk about a strategy, talk about the pluses and the minuses of the Baker-Hamilton Commission and work toward a solution that, on the one hand, will allow us to remove our combat troops, but on the other, will increase the stability of the region, allow us to continue to fight against international terrorism and allow us, as a nation, to address our strategic interests around the world. And this is – {{this is one of the}} drawbacks that we've had with so many troops having been put into this constant rotational basis inside one country when we have a war against international terrorism that's global." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and I was very much more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> step up our game.” ...|$|E

5000|$|In May 2016, {{prior to}} the film's release, Black said of a follow-up, [...] "I think it's a little {{premature}} to consider a sequel.

5000|$|On 21 September 2011, reports {{surfaced}} online that Will Champion, {{who plays}} the drums in the band, had expressed interest in singing the lyrics that were ultimately delegated to Rihanna.

30|$|In {{the face}} of the massive {{challenges}} the coming decades present to our societies, I draw my last conclusion about the nature of leadership in the sixth wave. What <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is <b>to</b> increase the intelligence—and thus performance—of the system on all levels. The upcoming resource revolution necessitates massive reductions of materials and energy flows per output to keep up within the rising commodity prices but also with the limits of the earth’s carrying capacity [29]. This great leap forward cannot happen without new leadership performance at all levels from organizations to nation-states and eventually to regional unions, such as EU. The industrial top-down approach must be replaced with a rather bottom-up method of leadership leading to greater commitment of the stakeholders.|$|R

40|$|Most every {{law school}} {{right now is}} {{thinking}} about its curriculum.
