500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What You Hear Is What You Get, taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} half of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher", the Family Stone took the stage {{alongside}} the other musicians, and Tyler called backstage [...] "Hey, Sly; let's do it the way we used to do it!" [...] Sporting a blonde mohawk hairdo, sunglasses, and a silver lamé suit, Sly Stone emerged and contributed vocals and keyboards to a continuation of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher." [...] Three minutes into the performance, Sly tossed a wave to the audience and exited the stage, leaving the Family Stone and the guest performers to complete the number alone.|$|E

One day, when I was too busy for anything, the people from Bonaventure drove over, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> back. I don't know why, but the way Haldane's elder {{daughter}} looked about the place just got my back up. 'You can't have him. This is where he belongs,' I said.|$|R
2500|$|At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's {{psychedelic}} tribute [...] to the 1960s [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher", Gravy's {{sleeping bag}} and tie-dyed false teeth were displayed. He and Paul Krassner appeared {{there on the}} last day of the exhibit on February 28, 1998.|$|E
2500|$|The tribute began {{halfway through}} the Grammy Awards ceremony, and was {{introduced}} by comedian Dave Chappelle. It featured Nile Rodgers, Joss Stone, Van Hunt, and John Legend performing [...] "Family Affair"; Fantasia and Devin Lima performing [...] "If You Want Me to Stay"; Adam Levine and Ciara performing [...] "Everyday People"; will.i.am performing [...] "Dance to the Music"; and Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith with Robert Randolph performing [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed, however, Stone {{seemed to be}} more {{confident}} and animated, often dancing and engaging the audience. He performed [...] "Stand", [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher", [...] "Sing A Simple Song", [...] "If You Want Me To Stay", and [...] "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", (which at one point morphed into [...] "Thank you For Talkin' To Me Africa", a track rarely performed in public). But the show was marred by sound problems and the vocals were barely audible through much of the show.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{being less}} commercially {{successful}} than previous singles, [...] "Up from the Skies" [...] was generally well-received critically. For magazine Rolling Stone, critic Parke Puterbaugh identified the song {{as an effective}} opening song for the album, suggesting that [...] ""Up From the Skies," [...] the mission statement of Axis: Bold As Love, ... draws the ear into an album that <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> higher, past gravity or limits of any kind." [...] Reviewer Cub Koda, for allmusic, summarised the song as a [...] "spacy rocker." ...|$|R
2500|$|Their early works, {{including}} [...] "A Fool in Love", [...] "It's Gonna Work Out Fine", [...] "I Idolize You" [...] and [...] "River Deep – Mountain High", became {{high points}} {{in the development of}} soul music, while their later works were noted for wildly interpretive re-arrangements of rock songs such as [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher" [...] and [...] "Proud Mary", the latter song for which they won a Grammy Award. They were also known for their often-ribald live performances, which were only matched by that of James Brown and the Famous Flames in terms of musical spectacle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} Stand! secured Sly and the Family Stone a {{performance}} slot at the landmark Woodstock Music and Art Festival. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance {{was said to}} be one of the best shows of the festival. A new non-album single, [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", was released the same month and went to #2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended). In 1970, following the release of the Woodstock documentary, the single of [...] "Stand!" [...] and [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher" [...] was reissued with the latter song now the a-side; it reached the Top 40.|$|E
2500|$|A second opening spot on The Rolling Stones' American tour in November 1969 made Ike and Tina a hot item. During that period, {{the group}} was reassigned to Liberty Records after Minit Records was shut down. In 1970, the Revue {{released}} the album, Come Together. The title track, a cover of the famed Beatles song, charted, as did their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher", which became their first top 40 pop song in eight years, peaking at #25, placing several spots higher than Sly's original had done months earlier. The album would sell {{a quarter of a}} million copies. That same year, Ike and Tina appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Their successful records and increasing popularity with mainstream audiences increased their nightly fee, going from $1,000 a night to $5,000 a night.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1968, Sly and the Family Stone {{released}} the single [...] "Everyday People", which became their first No.1 hit. [...] "Everyday People" [...] was {{a protest against}} prejudice of all kinds and popularized the catchphrase [...] "different strokes for different folks". With its B-side [...] "Sing a Simple Song", it served as the lead single for the band's fourth album, Stand!, which was released on May 3, 1969. The Stand! album eventually sold {{more than three million}} copies; its title track peaked at No.22 in the U.S. Stand! {{is considered one of the}} artistic high points of the band's career.

Sly and the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included Steven Tyler, John Legend, Van Hunt, Nile Rodgers and Robert Randolph. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a [...] "Sly" [...] beltbuckle and a silver lamé suit, he joined in on [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher." [...] Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked {{to the front of the}} stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. [...] "He went up the ramp , got on a motorcycle and took off," [...] Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Ehrlich said Stone refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began.|$|E

Really the sheik did not suspect you in the slightest, but I thought it was well to let him have a triumph over his followers, and so as he was going on I gave a little nod towards you and he caught it at once; but I could see at first he thought he was mistaken, and while the others were having their say I nodded to him and said, 'Yes it is he.'" ...|$|R
