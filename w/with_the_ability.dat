5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to descend trees head-first.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} know: 1) which {{learning}} {{model of the}} cooperative learning model of the Jigsaw-GNT, the cooperative learning model of the Jigsaw, and the direct learning model results in a better learning achievement in Mathematics; (2) which students of <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> high reasoning <b>ability,</b> <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moderate reasoning <b>ability,</b> and <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> low reasoning <b>ability</b> have a better learning achievement in Mathematics; (4) in each category of <b>the</b> reasoning <b>abilities,</b> which learning model of the cooperative learning model of the Jigsaw-GNT, the cooperative learning model of the Jigsaw, and the direct learning model results in a better learning achievement in Mathematics; and (3) in each learning model, which students of <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> high reasoning <b>ability,</b> <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moderate reasoning <b>ability,</b> and <b>the</b> students <b>with</b> <b>the</b> low reasoning <b>ability</b> have a better learning achievement in Mathematics.

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to estimate the range to their prey.|$|E

5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe.

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
