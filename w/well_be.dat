5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E

50|$|Artificial {{recharge}} of floodwater using injection <b>wells</b> <b>was</b> {{first developed}} in the Federal District around 1953.

5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L.

5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> considered dialects {{of a common}} Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including {{a long series of}} wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|During Operation Market Garden, the Allied {{parachute}} landings in the Netherlands, JG 11 {{was credited}} with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer. According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer. However, {{it may be the}} case that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> accurate.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could <b>well</b> <b>be</b> described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa {{was in fact}} dominant among the Mercians during the period {{leading up to the}} battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E

5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as <b>well</b> <b>be</b> 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can as <b>well</b> <b>be</b> seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as {{his work has}} been one of its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E

5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way.

5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult.

It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
