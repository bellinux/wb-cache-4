5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted {{permission}} for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no other realistic purchasers for the airline, {{and that a}} bankruptcy was imminent without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating {{at a loss to}} force new entrants out of the market.|$|E

Black Hawk asserted later that had Posey chose to attack him and his warriors that the blow dealt Black Hawk's band would have been decisive and war-ending. In fact, Dement's opinion <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more Native Americans at Kellogg's Grove than at any other engagement during the war. The next day more reinforcements arrived when Captain Jacob Early's detachment reached the grove.|$|E

5|$|In late 1944, {{as part of}} {{the buildup}} of US forces for an {{offensive}} in the Philippines, Allied planners decided to free up US forces in the region by having Australian forces replace them in the Aitape–Wewak area of New Guinea, Bougainville, and on New Britain. Advanced Australian elements began arriving on Bougainville in September and by November–December 1944 four brigades from the Australian II Corps took over responsibility for Bougainville from the divisions of US XIV Corps that had been stationed there previously. Allied intelligence reports and estimates regarding Japanese strength varied, but the considered position of the Australians <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> around 17,500 Japanese on the island. Although understrength, these troops were reported to still be capable of conducting effective combat operations and continued to pose a threat to the Allied base at Torokina. As such, in mid-December, after a period of information gathering, it was decided that the Australian II Corps, consisting of Militiamen from the 3rd Division and the 11th Brigade would go on the offensive. A three-pronged campaign was subsequently planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island. After the war, it was found that Australian intelligence estimates were significantly in error, with Japanese strength being more than 40,000.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the key}} {{discoveries of}} Dr. Bigg's team <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two types of killer whales living near the British Columbia coastline: {{residents}} which ate almost exclusively fish, and transients which hunted marine mammals and other warm-blooded prey. Resident and transient killer whale societies are separate, and the two types tend to avoid each other. The resident killer whale population of British Columbia and Washington is further divided into two communities, one northern and one southern, that do not interbreed.|$|E
25|$|Rats in New York City are prevalent, {{as in many}} densely {{populated}} areas. For a long time, the number of rats in New York City was unknown, and a common urban legend <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> up to five times as many rats as people. In 2014, however, scientists more accurately measured the entire city's rat population to be approximately only 20% {{of the number of}} humans; i.e., there were approximately 2 million rats to New York's 8.4 million people {{at the time of the}} study.|$|E

25|$|These systems had {{two primary}} {{problems}} {{in terms of}} accuracy. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several steps {{that had to be}} carried out in sequence in order to set up the bombsight correctly, and there was limited time to do all of this during the bomb run. As a result, the accuracy of the wind measurement was always limited, and errors in setting the equipment or making the calculations were common. The second problem was that the sight was attached to the aircraft, and thus moved about during maneuvers, during which time the bombsight would not point at the target. As the aircraft had to maneuver {{in order to make the}} proper approach, this limited the time allowed to accurately make corrections. This combination of issues demanded a long bomb run.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{companies}} {{bid for the}} ironworks contract, and the contract was awarded to Fritzøe Jernverk. Construction started in February 1952. A main concern <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not enough stonemasons in the area, causing several new ones to be trained while others were brought in from Sweden. Work on the foundations started in the late winter of 1852, when the water level was the lowest. The first attempt failed, with river flooding over the work and postponing construction a further year. The second attempt was made the following winter, with the workers having a three-month window in which the pillars needed to be built high enough that the spring floods would not enclose them. The second attempt succeeded. Construction was completed by February 1854. There were no serious accidents during the works, and the bridge was officially opened on 25 February.|$|E

25|$|Starting pilot wages {{were also}} well below average {{in terms of}} hourly rate, {{starting}} at $65,000 annually for Captains, and $30,000 for First Officers as a minimum guarantee. The average captain's earnings were about $90,000 vs $120,000 per year for a theoretical first year Captain at airlines like United Airlines (there is no first year pay at United) {{but in the case}} of Skybus this included a significant stock options and profit share package unique in the airline industry. Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8–10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12–14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14–15 days with no overnights. The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16–17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay.|$|E
500|$|The state {{argued that}} the case law cited by the Tenth Circuit only dealt with {{established}} Indian reservations and that the appellate court erred since the Sac and Fox reservation had been disestablished in the 1890s.

[...] Oklahoma stated that without determining reservation boundaries, if any, the lower court {{would be unable to}} properly apply tribal immunity.

500|$|From 1996, Ryum and 25 other {{regional}} airports were {{taken over by}} the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). The airport had 17,000 passengers in 1999. Four years after the nationalization, the CAA proposed that Ryum and certain {{other regional}} airport be closed in an effort to reduce costs, but this was disapproved by the government. The airport received a renewed certification by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2001, which in addition to new runway lighting required the airport to have a rescue boat. The ministry started a process in 2001 to consider using smaller aircraft than the 37-seat Dash 8 aircraft. The reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> on average only 17 passengers per flight from Rørvik and Namsos Airport, Høknesøra combined. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Since 2010, Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality has been pressing for an extension of the runway to [...] and construction of a larger hangar.|$|E

500|$|Derry City, officially called Londonderry, lies {{near the}} border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It has a {{majority}} nationalist population, and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections. Despite this, the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council, Londonderry Corporation, from 1923 onwards. The Unionists maintained their majority, firstly, by manipulating the constituency boundaries (gerrymandering) so that the South Ward, with a nationalist majority, returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and Waterside Ward, with unionist majorities, returned twelve councillors between them; secondly, by allowing only ratepayers to vote in local elections, rather than one man, one vote, so that a higher number of nationalists, who did not own homes, were disenfranchised; and thirdly, by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> about 2,000 nationalist families, and practically no unionists, on the housing waiting list, and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition. [...] The South Ward comprised the Bogside, Brandywell, Creggan, Bishop Street and Foyle Road, {{and it was this}} area that would become Free Derry.|$|E
500|$|The Avenue Range Station {{massacre}} {{involved the}} shooting murders of nine Aboriginal people by white settlers on the Avenue Range pastoral {{station in the}} southeast of the colony of South Australia in late 1848, part of the Australian frontier wars. Those killed were a blind old man, three female adults, two teenage girls, and three female children including a baby. The pastoralist James Brown and his overseer were suspected of committing the murders, and Brown was charged {{with the murder of}} [...] "unknown aboriginal natives" [...] on 1 March 1849. The magistrate who committed him for trial observed to a friend that there was [...] "little question of the butchery or the butcher". Listed for trial at the Supreme Court in the colonial capital of Adelaide on 11 June 1849, further investigation was ordered, but by the November 1849 sittings of that court the case had been dropped. One of the major complications involved in the case <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles combined with settler solidarity to ensure the case did not go to trial.|$|E
500|$|During this period, the British press {{seized upon}} a {{supposed}} rivalry between Oasis and Britpop band Blur. Previously, Oasis did not associate {{themselves with the}} Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the BBC's [...] "Britpop Now" [...] programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released new singles on the same day, setting up [...] "The Battle of Britpop" [...] that dominated the national news. Blur's [...] "Country House" [...] outsold Oasis' [...] "Roll with It" [...] 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week. Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming [...] "Country House" [...] sold more because it was less expensive (£1.99 vs £3.99) and because there were two different versions of [...] "Country House" [...] with different B-sides forcing serious fans to buy two copies. An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{problems associated with the}} barcode on the [...] "Roll with It" [...] single case, which did not record all sales. Noel Gallagher told The Observer in September that he hoped Damon Albarn and Alex James of Blur would [...] "catch AIDS and die", which caused a media furore. He subsequently apologised for this in a formal letter to various publications.|$|E
