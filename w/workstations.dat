5|$|When {{the show}} began using computers, the {{cardboard}} cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with CorelDRAW, then imported into PowerAnimator, {{which was used}} with SGI <b>workstations</b> to animate the characters. The <b>workstations</b> were linked to a 54-processor render farm that could render 10 to 15 shots an hour. Beginning with season five, the animators began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.|$|E

5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph <b>workstations</b> were replaced by n-AWIPS <b>workstations.</b> By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E

5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane <b>workstations</b> for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz <b>workstations.</b> Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E

5|$|When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived, the Rare {{studio was}} not yet ready for the change. Rare limited their {{releases}} to some Battletoads games and decided to invest their significant NES profit in purchasing expensive Silicon Graphics <b>workstations</b> to make three-dimensional models.

Their priority also changed at that time, as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx <b>workstations</b> acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Square {{showed an}} {{interactive}} SGI technical demonstration of Final Fantasy VI for the then {{next generation of}} consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics's prototype Nintendo 64 <b>workstations</b> to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 console; however, 1997 saw the release of Final FantasyVII for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, {{as opposed to the}} slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity Compact Discs used on rival systems. Final FantasyVII introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. It was because of this switch to 3D that a CD-ROM format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for Final FantasyVII and subsequent 3D titles in the series.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital <b>workstations</b> for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and ground command and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, {{the game}} utilises the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) {{rendering}} technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between job type, <b>workstation</b> design features, and the self-reported individual performance, team participation and group effectiveness of office workers. A total of 62 workers in four job types located in four field sales offices of a US computer manufacturer provided data. Regression analyses tested three indexes of <b>workstation</b> design as independent variables, including: environmental control through adjustability of <b>workstation</b> features, layout of <b>workstation</b> interior to match job requirements, and quality of <b>workstation</b> storage. For professional sales staff, <b>workstation</b> layout predicted 22 percent of the variance in individual performance.
