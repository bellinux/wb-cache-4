Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, which turned into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated head-on collision. Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E

40|$|Railway level {{crossings}} {{have the potential}} to bring motor vehicles and trains into fatal contact. In Australia there are approximately 9, 400 public railway {{level crossings}} across the country, protected either passively (64 %) or by active/automated systems (28 %). Passive crossings provide only a stationary sign warning of the possibility of trains crossing. Their message remains constant over time. Active systems, by contrast, activate automatic <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., flashing lights, bells, barrier, etc.) as a train approaches. Using a driving simulator, this paper compares driver compliance at railway level crossings equipped with either active or passive <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> including a stop sign, rumble strips, flashing lights/bell and in-vehicle auditory warning.

40|$|Control at railway level crossings, {{using either}} road rumble strips or {{in-vehicle}} auditory <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> {{has the potential}} to improve safety. This article evaluates driver behavior of these two devices and two conventional crossing devices (flashing lights and a stop sign) using a driving simulator. Rumble strips have been seen to encourage drivers to reduce speed earlier on approach to a level crossing but did not affect stopping compliance. In-vehicle auditory warnings have produced high compliance and, overall, have produced behavior comparable to that seen for conventional flashing lights. However, the detailed design features of such devices require further development before more concrete conclusions can be drawn. Contributing factors of age, gender, speed, and types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> were all found to significantly affect driver behavior at crossings. Overall, the results indicate that drivers behave differently and demonstrate higher signal compliance at actively protected crossings than at passively protected crossings for alternative and conventional <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
