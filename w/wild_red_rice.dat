In field competition studies (1989) <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> was very competitive with rice: 5 and 20 <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> plants/m 2 reduced rice yields by 40 and 60 respectively. Twenty <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> plants/m 2 shattered 35 seeds/m 2 before rice harvest, and contaminated harvested rice with about 1100 kg/ha of <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> grain. An infestation of 24 <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> plants/m 2 reduced rice yields by 10 if allowed to compete during 40 d. a. e., and 75 after season-long competition. In 1990 <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> competition was stronger, and an experiment combining effects of <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> density and duration of competition indicated that 50 yield was lost when 24 <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> plants/m 2 competed during 40 d. a. e. with Oryzica 1. Economic analysis using competition data indicated that with current prices in Colombia and given the high <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> competitiveness, herbicide control with glyphosate (2 kg ai/ha) followed by paraquat (0. 75 kg ia/ha) was economically justified even at very low <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> densities.

Because of the genetic and physiological similarities between <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> and commercial rice, herbicides have been unsuccessful in adequately controlling this weed. More recently, advances in plant breeding and genetic engineering have led to commercial rice tolerant of several herbicides that control <b>red</b> <b>rice.</b> Two recent advances include glufosinate and imazethapyr tolerant rice. This technology may provide a means of chemically controlling <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> in commercial rice fields. Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999 at several locations in the Texas rice belt. Glufosinate studies were located at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station (TAES) Research and Extension Center near Beaumont, and at the Coastal Ag Research Farm, near East Bernard, TX. Experiments involving imazethapyr tolerant rice were conducted near Beaumont and at the TAES site near Eagle Lake, TX. At the Beaumont location, <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> control was adequate with imazethapyr rates of 0. 011 kg/ha and higher, applied preplant incorporated or postemergence. However, postemergence treatments resulted in crop stunting and chlorosis as high as 29 % at 21 days after treatment. Preplant incorporated and preemergence applications of imazethapyr at all rates followed by 0. 04 to 0. 07 kg/ha postemergence resulted in excellent <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> control with minimal crop injury. Near Beaumont in 1998, single applications of glufosinate at 0. 29, 0. 45, or 0. 60 kg/ha provided similar levels of <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> control, whether applied at the 1 to 2 -leaf stage, or the 4 -leaf, 2 -tiller stage. However, the following year early postemergence applications were more efficacious than single late postemergence treatments.

The selection of farmers groups in organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> farming by the method of the census by the number of whole organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> farmers in Sukorejo as much as 18. The data used in this research with the primary data and secondary data collected with interview techniques, record keeping, and observations. Results of analysis showed that the average cost of labour Rp 10. 752. 579, 23 /ha/MT, average receipts Rp 29. 102. 950, 82 /ha/MT, average productivity of land 55, 97 kw/ha/MT, average earnings Rp 19. 350. 371, 58 /ha/MT, and the average efficiency 2, 71 to farming organic Brown rice. While the average cost of labour Rp 9. 724. 863, 86 /ha/MT, average revenue Rp. 10 / 26. 838. 349 MT/ha, average productivity of land 54, 77 kw/ha/MT, average earnings Rp 17. 113. 485, 24 /Ha/MT, and the average efficiency 2, 76 for organic rice farming. Based on the results of such analysis then it can be inferred that the productivity of the land, acceptance, cost of labour, organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> farming income is higher than white rice, organic farming. Organic white rice farming efficiency is higher than the organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> farming. After statistically tested, the productivity of farm land organic white <b>rice</b> with <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> organic farm productivity is same. Organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> farming income with organic white rice farming income is same. Efficiency of organic <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> with white rice organic efficiency is same.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} antioxidant {{properties of}} brans of twenty-nine <b>red</b> and white <b>rice</b> varieties of Sri Lanka. Methods: Brans of 21 new improved (NI), 2 old improved (OI) and 6 traditional <b>red</b> and white <b>rice</b> varieties of Sri Lanka were studied for range of antioxidant properties. The studied antioxidant properties included total polyphenolic content (TPC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 2, 2 ’-azino-bis(3 - ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazine (DPPH) radical scavenging activity in vitro. Bran of black rice variety from Korea was also studied {{for the same}} antioxidant properties for comparison. Results: Results exhibited significantly high ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities and 10, 7 and 2. 5 fold greater TPC, FRAP and ORAC activities in brans of <b>red</b> <b>rices</b> (BRRs) compared to brans of white rices irrespective of NI, OI and traditional rice types. Among BRRs traditional varieties had greater ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities and 1. 7, 1. 3 and 1. 2 fold respectively greater TPC, FRAP and ORAC in contrast to NI <b>red</b> <b>rices.</b> Traditional <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> varieties, Kalu Heeneti (TPC and ORAC), Pachchaperumal (TPC and DPPH) and Kurulu Thuda (DPPH) and OI <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> variety H 4 (FRAP) exhibited the highest activities for the antioxidant properties studied. Further, these varieties had significantly high activities compared to black rice. Conclusions: In conclusion, BRRs especially traditional <b>red</b> <b>rices</b> had greater antioxidant properties and consumption {{may be useful in}} managing various chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} injuries caused to the photosynthetic apparatus of three types of rice exposed to application of imidazolinone group herbicides. Two experiments were conducted using herbicides Imazethapyr+imazapic and Imazapyr+imazapic, in a split-plot experimental design, and a 3 x 3 factorial, with six replications. The first factor (A) consisted of the herbicide rates 0, 100 e 200 g ha- 1 of Imazethapyr+imazapic and 0, 140 e 280 g ha- 1 of Imazapyr+imazapic; factor B consisted of type of rice (cv. Puitá Inta CL, sensitive <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> ecotype and <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> ecotype with suspected herbicide tolerance to Imidazolinone). Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were evaluated in plants at 30 days after herbicide application, using a portable fluorometer (HandyPEA, Hanstech). The photosynthetic metabolism of cv. Puitá Inta CL was found to tolerate commercial dosages of both herbicides. High sensitivity to the herbicides was observed for the sensitive <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> ecotype, while the photosynthetic apparatus of <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> ecotype with suspected herbicide tolerance showed high tolerance to both herbicides applied at rates higher than the commercial rate. The application of chemical herbicides of the imidazolinone group on rice plants causes changes in the photosynthetic metabolism of plants, detected by evaluating the emission of transient chlorophyll a fluorescence. This method can be useful in helping detect resistance and/or tolerance of <b>red</b> <b>rice</b> plants to herbicides of the imidazolinone group...|$|R
