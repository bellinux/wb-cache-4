40|$|In this study, 100 % cotton {{knitted fabrics}} made <b>from</b> <b>combed</b> cotton and combed pima cotton were dyed with {{reactive}} dye, with different dye concentrations. Colour properties such as CIE L*a*b* values {{as well as}} dyeing uniformity of the dyed fabrics were measured. The relationships between colour properties and the ultraviolet protection afforded by cotton knitted fabrics were investigated. Experimental results revealed that dye concentration {{is the most important}} factor. In addition, only L* values have a direct mathematical relationship with the ultraviolet protection factor; a* and b* values and dyeing uniformity were not found to have a significant correlation with ultraviolet protection factor values. Meanwhile, knitted fabric made <b>from</b> <b>combed</b> cotton fibre has better ultraviolet protection performance than fabric made <b>from</b> <b>combed</b> pima cotton fibre.

This paper summarizes and enumerates some comprehensive utilization methods and proposes new ideas on the disposal and comprehensive utilization of solid <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> mines, including reducing the discharge of solid waste by recovering sand from ore dressing flow for construction industry and a mine back filling approaches. The process flow of tailings separated for different purposes that could be carried out in iron mines is putting forward.

The {{research was}} a survey upon the availability of organic wastes in the Oeba traditional market by collecting data such as type, {{quantity and quality of}} organic wastes as the measurement variables. The data obtained were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that the organic wastes that were available in the Oeba traditional markets consisted of three groups, i. e. organic <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> animal products (available in 3 kinds), organic <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> marine products (available in 12 kinds), and organic <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> agricultural products (available in 35 kinds). Based on the quantity, quality and continuity of the organic wastes, there were only 6 kinds of the organic wastes that could be used as pig feed i. e. Tuna or cakalang fish (1040 gr/day), swordfish (686 gr/day), tembang fish (55, 86 gr/day), water spinach (164294, 57 gr/day), mustard greens (31949 gr/day), and rice bran (40000 gr/day) ...|$|R
