40|$|Two librarians {{at a small}} STEM {{academic}} library have partnered <b>with</b> <b>professors</b> {{to develop}} and teach chemistry and writing courses. These librarians have successfully worked <b>with</b> <b>professors</b> {{to serve as an}} active presence within the classroom. This article describes the challenges of navigating the typical obstacles librarians face when attempting to integrate information literacy into the curriculum, reflects on the benefits of these collaborations, and touches on strategies for implementing similar programs at other institutions. It outlines two distinct approaches to collaborating <b>with</b> <b>professors</b> on credit-bearing information literacy courses, along with the key steps involved in planning and implementing these courses, including generating institutional buy-in, identifying potential collaborators, negotiating workload and responsibilities with collaborators, and planning to sustain courses beyond a single academic year. Suggestions for overcoming obstacles, supplemented by experience-based recommendations, are discussed...|$|R

5|$|By then, Reitz had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law <b>with</b> <b>professor</b> F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{can visit}} merchants known as 'Spivs' to buy {{additional}} ammunition and services. He {{can also get}} advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston to learn new moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded <b>with</b> <b>Professor</b> Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E

The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. <b>With</b> <b>Professor</b> Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet <b>with</b> <b>Professor</b> Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a vacuum, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.|$|E

Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she herself had misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine Tempo di Roma with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a magazine reporter.|$|E

5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked <b>with</b> <b>Professor</b> Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed a menu of dishes through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had <b>with</b> <b>Professor</b> Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
