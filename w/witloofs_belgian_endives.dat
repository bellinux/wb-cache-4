During vegetative growth, carbohydrate reserves accumulated normally in these annuals, and they were properly mobilized prior to anthesis. The effects of individual root-inducing left-hand T-DNA genes on flowering were tested in carrot, in which rolC (root locus) was the primary promoter of annualism and rolD caused extreme dwarfism.

40|$|Red {{discoloration}} is {{an important}} quality disorder of <b>Belgian</b> <b>endive</b> (Cichorium intybus L.) and results from cell damage and subsequent oxidation of phenolic compounds during postharvest storage. The mechanism is unknown so far, but a correlation between {{the length of the}} floral stem ("core") and the occurrence of the disorder has been observed. In this contribution it is hypothised that the floral stem, which continues to grow during postharvest storage, induces mechanical stresses in the intermediary leaves which ultimately result in cell rupture. As a consequence, phenolic substrates and polyphenol oxidases, which are compartmentalised in intact cells, may merge and lead to red coloured polyphenolic compounds. For validating this hypothesis, the development of mechanical stresses in the intermediary leaves of chicons during postharvest storage has been analysed using the finite element method. The shape changes of the leaves were determined through NMR images of the chicory head, obtained over a five day shelf life period. Stress distributions were computed from these shape changes. The calculated stress pattern showed a remarkable agreement both in position and shape with the actual visual observation of the red discolorationstatus: publishe...|$|R

Jarovization was only partly successful. Most of the crops under investigation still required a period of plant vernalization to behave as an annual.

The best sowing time for a full-grown seedcrop from jarovized seed was two, or, at most, three weeks later than from untreated seed.

40|$|Witloof (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum Hegi) is a {{biennial}} plant. As {{a consequence}} {{the production of}} <b>Belgian</b> <b>Endives</b> (syn. chicory) comprises two phases. During the first vegetative phase, plants are grown in open field from spring till autumn. Only the roots are harvested and subsequently stored at low temperatures in order to induce vernalization. In the second generative phase, the apical meristem of the vernalized root is forced to regrow under dark conditions; this results {{in the formation of}} a ‘torpedo’ shaped, etiolated chicory head. Yield and quality of the chicory highly depends on the physiological status of the roots at the time of root harvest and forcing. Determination of the optimal root harvesting time is therefore critical. The current research focuses on the maturation of the chicory roots {{at the end of the}} field period. In this respect, root behaviour in forcing and chemical content of the roots at field harvest where linked. Therefore measurements of carbohydrate composition, soluble amino acids and chlorophyll content were executed bi-weekly and linked with physical and physiological characteristics of chicory plants in the field.

In addition we show that monitoring gradients in the root water and pressure potential also indicates physiological maturity of the roots. status: publishe...|$|R

It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors {{in the absence of}} sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves. It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour. The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem {{at the bottom of the}} head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness. Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium. Today France is the largest producer of endive.|$|R

40|$|A genetic {{study of}} the {{biennial}} crop <b>Belgian</b> <b>endive</b> (Cichorium intybus) was carried out to {{examine the effect of}} nitrogen nutrition during the vegetative phase in the control of the productivity and quality of the chicon (etiolated bud), a crop that grows during the second phase of development (forcing process). A population of 302 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) was obtained from the cross between contrasting lines "NS 1 " and "NR 2 ". A genetic map was constructed and QTLs of several physiological and agronomical traits were mapped under two levels of nitrogen fertilization during the vegetative phase (N- and N+). The agronomical traits showed high broad sense heritability, whereas the physiological traits were characterized by low broad sense heritability. Nitrogen reserves mobilization during the forcing process was negatively correlated with nitrogen reserves content of the tuberized root and common QTLs were detected for these traits. The chicon productivity and quality were not correlated, but showed one common QTL. This study revealed that chicon productivity and quality were genetically associated with nitrogen reserves mobilization that exerts opposite effects on both traits. Chicon productivity was positively correlated with N reserves mobilization under N- and N+ and a common QTL with the same additive effects was detected for both traits. Chicon quality was negatively correlated with N reserves mobilization under N- and N+ and a common QTL with opposite additive effects was detected for both traits. These results lead to the conclusion that N reserves mobilization is a more effective trait than N reserves content in predicting chicon productivity and quality. Finally, this study revealed agronomical and physiological QTLs utilizable by breeders via marker-assisted selection to aid the optimization of chicon quality under adapted N fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{has always}} been the main focus for <b>Belgian</b> <b>endive</b> {{producers}} in Flanders to hold its comparative advantage with respect to the mass production in our neighbouring countries. To maintain its position in witloof chicory production, investments in quality improvement are inevitable, judging by the constant decrease of both, the acreage for chicory root production and the trade balance for <b>Belgian</b> <b>endives,</b> which dropped from 11. 7 million EUR in 2000 to 2. 7 million EUR in 2008. So, the main focus in the doctoral research project was exploring the possibilities for quality improvement in chicory production by focusing on the maturation process {{at the end of the}} field phase. In this respect, on line measurements of changes in soil matric potentials in the root zone are related to plant development, maturation and quality of the chicory heads produced. Given that most problems encountered in the forcing period are the consequence of inferior root quality at the start of the forcing period, research emphasis was on correlating postharvest characteristics of chicons with the root quality at harvest, and to use this information to define the most optimal moment for root harvesting. The logic behind this is that the quality and related postharvest characteristics of chicons are mainly determined by the quality of the root at the start of the forcing period and the forcing and storage conditions. More specifically the physiological behavior of the roots during forcing, which ultimately determines the overall quality of the produced chicons, is intrinsically connected with its previous history in the field. The chicory supply chain commences with growing plants from seeds in the field. During the vegetative development, from spring till autumn, tuberized roots are formed and the foundation of high quality chicons is laid. Through field management growers attempt to provide roots with a superior quality containing the optimal amounts of carbohydrates, nitrogen compounds and mineral nutrients. For the growth process and physiological homeostasis, water uptake and hence soil water availability in the root zone are of crucial importance. In this respect changes in soil matric potential at two depths (30 and 60 cm below surface) measured near the tap root were related to the chicory plant development of Cichorium intybus L. throughout the growing season. The soil parameter &# 916;p (diel difference in soil matric potential) was found to be a good estimator of root activity, evolving throughout the growing season in accordance to crop developmental stages. Given that this methodology allows separation of the different stages during plant development non-destructively, makes it an ideal tool for decision making in field and harvest management. Since yield and quality of chicory heads highly depends on the physiological status of the roots at harvest, determination of the optimal root harvesting time is critical. Based on chemical and physical measurements the physiological events occurring in the chicory plants during the second phase of the growing season were monitored. A new concept of potential gradients in the root tissue, expressed in terms of root water, solute and pressure potentials was derived to determine the most optimal field harvest date of chicory. The influence of physiological maturity on the forcing results was investigated for the early hybrid Mont Blanc. The focus was explicitly on the characterization of chicon quality since the financial benefit for endive growers mainly depends on the quality as defined by the Belgian auction guidelines. Based on the produced chicory heads meeting the internal and external quality characteristics and preserved from red discoloration, a particular harvest range was defined, matching the right physiological state of the roots. In this period the dry weight of the leaves decreased, LAI was minimal and an adequate fructan reserve had built up, together with a sufficient but restricted amount of sucrose. In addition, the declining amplitude of the diel variation in soil matric potential at 60 cm was found a non-destructive method for prediction of the maturity stage. During postharvest storage and commercialization of chicory heads, several physiological disorders might develop. One kind of physiological defects occurring both at harvest and during storage is red discoloration in the chicory heads (reddening). The origin of this disorder is complex with different possible triggers throughout the whole production chain. Morpho-anatomical analyses revealed that red discoloration mainly manifests as scattered red spots, parallel stripes or a red film in the basal part of the outer leaves of the chicory head and different types of tissue (e. g. sub-epidermal and vascular tissue) in the etiolated leaf. In addition to the identification of the most optimal harvest moment, storage time of the roots and temperatures during forcing have all been examined with respect to the occurrence of red discoloration. Moreover, chemical analyses showed that the amount of amino acids that were remobilized from the roots during the forcing process and the abundance of free amino acids in the chicory heads correspond well with the appearance of red discoloration during post harvest storage of the chicory heads. Immediate cooling of the chicory heads at harvest and a solid cold chain are essentially to reduce the hazard of reddening. status: publishe...|$|R
