Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil <b>war</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.|$|E

25|$|An {{attack by}} Japan on the U.S. could not {{guarantee}} the U.S. would declare war on Germany. After such an attack, American public anger would {{be directed at}} Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first. For instance, Germany had been {{at war with the}} UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval <b>war</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well. Nevertheless, it was only Hitler's declaration of war on 11 December, unforced by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war.|$|E

The Man-Bats are able to bring the {{remaining}} Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate. Mr. Freeze and Clayface later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory. Mr. Freeze tells Mirror Master II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use Weather Wizard to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham. As the Rogues are fighting the two, Black Mask (alongside his False Face society) arrives to capture the Rogues to receive the bounty.|$|E

2500|$|In Medieval Europe the {{surgeons}} social status improved greatly as their expertise was {{needed on the}} battlefield.

2500|$|After the United States' {{entry into}} World War I, Batchelor {{was hired by}} The Detroit News and {{reported}} on the war from France. Batchelor later described {{the reason for his}} decision to take the job with the News: [...] "Somehow, with a <b>war</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> it didn't seem important if the Tigers were in first place or last." [...] Two of Batchelor's articles from France, one reporting on soldiers' efforts to play baseball during lulls in the combat, and another about an Illinois school teacher who taught the French forces to play baseball, were published by The Sporting News. He returned from Europe in May 1919 as a passenger on the SS Noordam.|$|E

If war breaks out throughout the entire country, this would be advantageous for us as far as the Galilee is concerned because, without having to make any major effort - we could use just enough of the force required for the purpose without weakening our military efforts {{in other parts of the}} country - we could empty the Galilee completely.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Clark {{joined a}} panel of about 20 {{prominent}} Arab and one other non-Arab lawyers to defend Saddam Hussein in his trial before the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Clark appeared before the Iraqi Special Tribunal in late November 2005 arguing [...] "that it failed to respect basic human rights and was illegal because it was formed {{as a consequence of}} the United States' illegal war of aggression against the people of Iraq." [...] Clark said that unless the trial was seen as [...] "absolutely fair", it would [...] "divide rather than reconcile Iraq". Christopher Hitchens claimed that Clark was admitting Hussein's guilt when Clark reportedly stated in a 2005 BBC interview: [...] "He [...] had this huge <b>war</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and you have to act firmly when you have an assassination attempt".|$|E
2500|$|Historically, Wolves {{have been}} highly influential, most notably as being founder {{members of the}} Football League, as well as having played an {{instrumental}} role {{in the establishment of}} the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League.

2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold <b>war</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E

Pressure was brought to bear upon the several nations through President Roosevelt, and at last it was agreed to leave matters to be settled by arbitration at The Hague. The agreements to this end were signed at Washington, much to the President's satisfaction. All trouble then ceased, and American commerce was resumed as before.|$|E
