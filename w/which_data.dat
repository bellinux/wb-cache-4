5|$|Many planned {{elements}} were never filmed, due to production time constraints. Moore {{had hoped for}} an extended battle scene in <b>which</b> <b>Data</b> would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in <b>which</b> <b>Data</b> walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by <b>which</b> <b>data</b> is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E
5|$|Australia's defence {{expenditure}} {{is much larger}} in dollar terms to that of most countries in Australia's region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China spends somewhat more on defence {{as a proportion of}} GDP than Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its expenditure. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As a proportion of GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for <b>which</b> <b>data</b> is available.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at <b>which</b> <b>data</b> can be analysed.|$|E

5|$|The cost of {{construction}} of the church can be inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost {{of construction}} or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. This allows consideration of the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of 2012, the figures are updated using data from 2010, the latest year for <b>which</b> <b>data</b> is available.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} <b>which</b> <b>data</b> are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
