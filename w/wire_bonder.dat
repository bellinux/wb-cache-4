5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in the mid}} 1960s, Alexander Coucoulas, {{reported the}} first thermosonic wire bonds {{using a combination of}} heat, ultrasonic vibrations and pressure which led to his first invention. He first set up a commercial ultrasonic <b>wire</b> <b>bonder</b> (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the ultrasonic bonder. The bond region was then heated during the ultrasonic bonding cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the ultrasonic bonding cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of thermal softening and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work ultrasonic bonding. In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower vibratory energy levels than ultrasonic bonding, to form the required bond area. As a result of using lower bonding parameters to form the required contact area, Thermosonic Bonding largely eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit micro-chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a micro-chip which had been permanently connected inside a computer or a myriad of other electronic devices.|$|E

The new technique has been termed `microflex interconnects' (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components. The MFI technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible foils with embedded metallized conductors. The MFI foils may also serve as circuit substrates. This basic foil material is polyimide (Du Pont PI 2611) or BCB which are patterned photolithographically. Platinum, gold or either conductive metals are sputtered or evaporated on the foil and patterned using lift-off technique. Several metallization layers can be embedded in the material. Pitch {{and shape of the}} MFI contact pads correspond to the one of the chips to be interconnected. A via hole is placed {{in the center of the}} MFI contact pads.

Special processing was done to create interconnects on the edge to provide for interconnects to each of the die. These processes require an IC type fabrication facility (fab) and special processing equipment. In contrast, we have developed packaging assembly methods to created vertical through vias in bond pads of active silicon die, isolate these vias, and metal fill these vias without the use of a special IC fab. These die with through vias can then be joined and stacked to create a 3 -D MCM. Vertical through vias in active die are created by laser micromachining using a Nd:YAG laser. Besides the fundamental 1064 nm (infra-red) laser wavelength of a Nd:YAG laser, modifications to our Nd:YAG laser allowed us to generate the second harmonic 532 nm (green) laser wavelength and fourth harmonic 266 nm (ultra violet) laser wavelength in laser micromachining for these vias.

This thesis presents new methods for wafer-level integration of nickel-titanium SMA sheets and wires. For SMA sheets, a technique for the integration of patterned SMA sheets to silicon wafers using gold-silicon eutectic bonding is demonstrated. A method for selective release of gold-silicon eutectically bonded microstructures by localized electrochemical etching, is also presented.

Nickel electroplating offers the most promising permanent fixing technique, since both a strong mechanical and good electrical connection to the wire is achieved during the same process step. Resistively heated microactuators are also fabricated by integrating prestrained SMA wires onto silicon cantilevers. These microactuators exhibit displacements that are among the highest yet reported. The actuators also feature a relatively low power consumption and high reliability during longterm cycling. New designs for gas microvalves are presented and valves using both SMA sheets and SMA wires for actuation are fabricated. The SMA-sheet microvalve exhibits a pneumatic performance per footprint area, three times higher than that of previous microvalves. The SMA-wire-actuated microvalve also allows control of high gas flows and in addition, offers benefits of lowvoltage actuation and low overall power consumption. QC 2012051...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{wire bonding}} {{is the most}} {{utilized}} technique in forming electrical interconnections in microelectronics. However, there is a lacking in the fundamental understanding of the process. In order {{for there to be}} improvements in the process {{a better understanding of the}} process is required. 	The mechanism of the bond formation in ultrasonic wire bonding is not known. Although there have been theories proposed, inconsistencies have been shown to exist in them. One of the main inconsistencies is the contribution of ultrasound to the bonding process. A series of experiments to investigate the mechanism of bond formation are performed on a semi automatic <b>wire</b> <b>bonder</b> at room temperature. 25 µm diameter Au wire is ball bonded and also 25 µm diameter Al wire is wedge-wedge bonded onto polished Cu sheets of thickness 2 mm. It is found that a modified microslip theory can describe the evolution of bonding. With increasing ultrasonic power the bond contact transitions from microslip into gross sliding. The reciprocating tangential relative motion at the bond interface results in wear of surface contaminants which leads to clean metal/metal contact and bonding. The effect of superimposed ultrasound during deformation on the residual hardness of a bonded ball is systematically studied for the first time. An innovative bonding procedure with in-situ ball deformation and hardness measurement is developed using an ESEC WB 3100 automatic ball bonder. 50 µm diameter Au wire is bonded at various ultrasound levels onto Au metallized PCB substrate at room temperature. It is found that sufficient ultrasound which is applied during the deformation leads to a bonded ball which is softer than a ball with a similar amount of deformation without ultrasound. No hardening of the 100 µm diameter Au ball is observed even with the maximum ultrasonic power capable of the equipment of 900 mW. In summary, the fundamental effect of ultrasound in the wire bonding process is the reciprocating tangential displacement at the bond interface resulting in contaminant dispersal and bonding. A second effect of ultrasound is the softening of the bonded material when compared to a similarly non-ultrasound deformed ball...|$|E
40|$|Flip chip is an {{electronic}} packaging {{technology that is}} becoming more popular in first level electronic packaging {{as the need for}} high density electrical interconnects becomes more relevant. The parallel nature of flip chip and harsh thermomechanical treatment introduces stress to the microchip and substrate. This is primarily caused by the application of high forces and mismatch in the thermal coefficient of expansion among the materials in the system. Other noise factors like misalignment, parallelism mismatch, warpage, pillar height variation, and temperature variation can weaken the bonding process. Unlike wire bonding, {{there is a lack of}} tools available for quality assessment of the flip chip process in-situ locally at the interconnect sites. There are however some existing wire bonding sensor tools which can be modified to be useful for optimization of flip chip equipment and processes. A 4 x 3 mm CMOS chip is designed to record XYZ force and temperature profiles in-situ on a 2 -dimensional surface during a simulated flip chip process. This was done as a low risk proof of concept to evaluate if the wire bonding tools can be adapted for a flip chip application. 95 μm square Al bond pads arranged in a square 8 x 8 array with 400 μm pitch have embedded piezoresistive force sensors and local top metal resistive temperature detectors. The chip is packaged with auxiliary wire bonds to deliver power and capture signals while operating under a bond head. Ball bumps 73 μm in diameter are deposited onto the sensor pads using 4 N Au wire. Z sensors are calibrated using a modified automatic <b>wire</b> <b>bonder.</b> A normalized sensitivity of SN= 1. 39 mV/V/N is measured. Temperature sensors are calibrated at 50 °C using Kelvin probing yielding 186. 94 Ω. A 3 x 3 mm Si wafer with Al patterning is used as a dummy pressure plate for touchdowns on the sensor chip with an experimental setup advanced process bond head. Force and temperature signals are recorded locally at each bump. 80 N force with 200 °C temperature ramps ups are applied. Evidence of tilt and thermal expansion are detected. The prototype is demonstrated successfully and identified the most stressful stage of the bonding which occurred during thermal transients, i. e. during the short lived overshoot period of maximum stress in the force signals observed immediately after the application of heat to the system...|$|E
