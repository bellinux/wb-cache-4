The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth.

The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E

5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E

25|$|Known as o Bruxo (the Sorcerer), Pascoal {{often makes}} music with {{unconventional}} {{objects such as}} teapots, children's toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordion, melodica, saxophone, guitar, flute, voice, various brass and folkloric instruments. Perhaps because {{he grew up in}} the countryside, he uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his Música da Lagoa, in which the musicians burble water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed {{it was part of the}} game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was in a bad way against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E
500|$|Homosexual or {{bisexual}} activity also occurs between gods, {{although such}} interactions are most usually considered purely ritualistic, or have purposes other than sexual pleasure. Agni, {{the god of}} fire, wealth and creative energy, has same-sex sexual encounters that involve accepting semen from other gods. [...] Although married to the goddess Svaha, Agni is also shown as {{being part of a}} same-sex couple with Soma, the god of the moon. Agni takes a receptive role in this relationship, accepting semen from Soma <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> paralleling Agni's role in accepting sacrifices from Earth to Heaven. Orthodox Hinduism emphasises that these are [...] "mithuna", ritual sexual encounters, and Agni and his mouth represent the feminine role.|$|E
500|$|Measuring , Torpedo...Los! is an oil {{on canvas}} painting. By {{enlarging}} {{the face of the}} captain relative to the entire field, Lichtenstein makes him more prominent than in the source. He retained the source's [...] "clumsiness" [...] in how the secondary figure is presented and replaced the dialogue with a much shorter [...] "cryptic command". The original source had dialog related to the repeated torpedoing of the same ship, but Lichtenstein cut the entire speech balloon down to two words. He moved the captain's scar from his nose to his cheek and he made the captain appear more aggressive by depicting him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open, also opting to leave the eye which was not looking through the periscope open. He also made the ship appear to be more technologically sophisticated with a variety of changes. The scar was actually most readily apparent in panels other than the source from the same story.|$|E

500|$|Asturias shows how, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running [...] "aimlessly, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> opened and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting". Just a few lines later, the Zany is [...] "whin like an injured dog". In what is in part {{a critique of the}} book, Jorge Barrueto argues that [...] depicts Latin America as a whole as [...] "Other". [...] Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this [...] "otherness" [...] as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and no more than an [...] "imitation of the European ways". [...] Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be a land where [...] "Otherness" [...] prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot [...] "evolve" [...] or reach truly European levels of modernity. [...] For Barrueto, [...] "this narrative's goal is to prove that Latin American societies, though they are aware of the blueprint of Modernity, are unable to act accordingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Mating {{takes place}} at {{different}} times of the year {{in different parts of the}} manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating [...] "trains" [...] with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around [...] per hour. He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> which may take twenty or thirty minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to twenty other males. The pair then part. For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{says that}} there are many men in Valhalla, and many more who will arrive, yet they will [...] "seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök, after Fenrir's son Sköll has {{swallowed}} the sun and [...] his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon, the stars will disappear from the sky. The earth will shake violently, trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free. Fenrisúlfr will go forth <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> opened wide, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth, and flames will burn from his eyes and nostrils. Later, Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr. With the forces assembled there, an immense battle will take place. During this, Odin will ride to fight Fenrisúlfr. During the battle, Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf. This foot will bear a legendary shoe [...] "for which the material has been collected throughout all time." [...] With one hand, Víðarr will take hold of the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth, killing Fenrisúlfr. High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support, some of which mention Fenrir.|$|E

500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms {{a picture}} that depicts a traveling circus populated {{by a group of}} deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept her, we accept her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E
500|$|The 9th century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical {{discussion of}} instruments cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical {{instrument of the}} Byzantines along with the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the salandj (probably a bagpipe). The first of these, the early bowed stringed instrument known as the Byzantine lyra, would {{come to be called}} the lira da braccio, in Venice, where it is considered by many to have been the predecessor of the contemporary violin, which later flourished there. The bowed [...] "lyra" [...] is still played in former Byzantine regions, where it is known as the Politiki lyra (lit. [...] "lyra of the City" [...] i.e. Constantinople) in Greece, the Calabrian lira in Southern Italy, and the Lijerica in Dalmatia. The second instrument, the organ, originated in the Hellenistic world (see Hydraulis) and was used in the Hippodrome during races. [...] A pipe organ with [...] "great leaden pipes" [...] was sent by the emperor Constantine V to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks in 757. [...] Pepin's son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning its establishment in Western church music. The final Byzantine instrument, the aulos was a double reeded woodwind like the modern oboe or Armenian duduk. Other forms include the plagiaulos (πλαγίαυλος, from πλάγιος [...] "sideways"), which resembled the flute, and the askaulos (ἀσκός askos – wine-skin), a bagpipe. These bagpipes, also known as Dankiyo (from ancient Greek: angion (Τὸ ἀγγεῖον) [...] "the container"), had been played even in Roman times. Dio Chrysostom wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (tibia, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek aulos) <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit. The bagpipes continued to be played throughout the empire's former realms through to the present.
