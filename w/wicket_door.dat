25|$|The inset <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> {{also has}} a pair of strap hinges that are {{miniature}} images of the larger door with similar construction from horizontal boards. There is a single deadbolt {{on the inside of}} the door.|$|E
25|$|The quaintness of this edifice derives {{not only}} from the Tudor swag (kicked gables) at the eaves, the south porch, the porch arches, and <b>wicket</b> <b>door,</b> but also from fanciful embellishments to the {{building}} in the form of unique door pilasters and brick plaques.|$|E
25|$|The {{north and}} south doorways are of c.1300. The north doorway is pointed with heavy moulding, and the south the same but {{including}} a hood mould. The 14th-century south door is of paneled oak with an ogee-headed <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> inset. To {{the west of the}} south door interior is a 17th-century alms box.|$|E
60|$|A <b>wicket</b> in the <b>door</b> was opened, and the portress {{looked out}} through a grating.|$|R
60|$|A <b>wicket</b> in the <b>door</b> opened, and out {{looked a}} {{tremendous}} old brass blunderbuss charged {{up to the}} muzzle with slugs, who was the porter; and Tom started back a little {{at the sight of}} him.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Wicket Gate" [...] {{could be}} the wooden gate at the {{entrance}} to the Elstow parish church or the <b>wicket</b> gate (small <b>door)</b> in the northern wooden entrance door at the west end of Elstow Abbey Church.|$|R
25|$|The western inner {{entrance}} {{is now a}} <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> patterned after that of Yeocomico Church although it is unpainted. Previously, there were two central opening, compass-headed doors at the outer entrance of the porch arch. The southern {{entrance is}} a square-headed, battened door with decorative, molded bricks {{in the shape of}} an ovolo surrounding it. The images from the Library of Congress site are worth study, for they show in the late 1950s a compass headed door at this entrance that is evidenced by brick repairs above the doorway.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> is a {{pedestrian}} door {{built into a}} much larger door allowing access without requiring {{the opening of the}} larger door. [...] Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> has {{pilaster}}s {{on either}} side unseen in other Virginia colonial churches. Each pilaster consists of the following structure from the bottom at the water table to the top: water table – five bricks (identical in height to rest of the water table); border of beveled brick; pillar – 11 convex bricks one brick wide; a torus- shaped border brick; a pillar of 8 horizontally convex bricks; a border brick of an ovolo with a flat edge on top; the apex of two bricks {{in the form of}} a flattened arrow; and a tip of [...] a half-sphere one-half brick wide [...]|$|E
6000|$|An old man's face peeped {{through a}} little <b>wicket</b> in the <b>door,</b> and at {{sight of the}} two youths, evidently of high rank, said in a {{trembling}} voice, 'Alas! alas! Sir, bid these cruel men go away. I have nothing here--no one--only my sick daughter.' ...|$|R
60|$|Noel Rainguesson hid {{himself and}} heard it, and came and told me, {{and after that}} we went {{together}} to listen, bribing the inn hostess to let us have her little private parlor, where we could stand at the <b>wickets</b> in the <b>door</b> and see and hear.|$|R
60|$|I walked {{round the}} yard, {{and through a}} <b>wicket,</b> to another <b>door,</b> at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and {{otherwise}} extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and his eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty annihilated.|$|R
2500|$|Inside {{the south}} porch is a <b>wicket</b> <b>door,</b> {{the only known}} one in an American colonial church. It {{consists}} of five vertical sections and three horizontal sections each divided by battens. [...] The smaller door is located within the middle three battens vertically and the central one horizontally. Cyma reversa mouldings are used on the battens. In the 1960s, {{the area around the}} doorway’s segmental arch was covered with a layer of plaster. [...] The doorway’s wooden molding is of a cyma reversa, reverse S, curve. On the hinge side is a large wooden peg that keeps the upper hinge from pulling out of the frame. The hinges consist of thick pintles at {{the top and bottom of}} the left side of the door. The door is said to weigh 1,000 pounds.|$|E
60|$|Barnakill led {{him gently}} within {{the area of}} the railings, where he might conceal his emotion, and it was but a few seconds before Lancelot had {{recovered}} his self-possession and followed him up the steps through the <b>wicket</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the private}} passage into that closet, {{of which the}} old man speaks?" [...] This King Louis {{said in a low}} and anxious tone, holding Crevecoeur's arm fast with one hand, and {{pointing}} to the <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> with the other.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he left me}} and I {{began to}} undress, for I was dog-tired and very sleepy. I slept fifteen hours and woke up finely {{refreshed}} at ten the next morning. Vienna coffee! It {{was the first thing}} I thought of--that unapproachable luxury--that sumptuous coffee-house coffee, compared with which all other European coffee and all American hotel coffee is mere fluid poverty. I rang, and ordered it; also Vienna bread, that delicious invention. The servant spoke through the <b>wicket</b> in the <b>door</b> and said--but you know what he said. He referred me to the bill of fare. I allowed him to go--I had no further use for him.|$|R
60|$|So {{they lived}} for a year all alone in the tower; {{but they were not}} very unhappy, for the sun smiled in at them, birds built nests in the ivy that covered the gray walls, and the wind sang them to sleep as it roared or whispered round their high room. They loved and cheered each other, and kept up their courage till one day no bread and water was put in at the little <b>wicket</b> of the <b>door.</b> For three days no food came, and then they knew that the wicked Queen meant to starve them to death. People thought them lost; and all but the few who were {{faithful}} forgot the Princes and obeyed the Queen, who now ruled over them like a tyrant, while her daughters grew more proud and selfish every day, and the old King slept most of the time, careless of everything but his ease.|$|R
5000|$|... "He is then {{instructed}} {{how he is}} to {{get into}} the lodge. He is instructed to the outside door, sneeze twice and rap once; at this the sentinel raises the slide or <b>wicket</b> in the <b>door,</b> and the candidate says 'Squi,' to which the sentinel says 'Bob,' then both say 'Squibob,' and the member enters. He then advances to the inside door where he sneezes once and blows his nose and raps, at which the slide is lifted and the candidate says 'Lager,' to which the sentinel responds 'Beer,' and then both say 'Swei Glass,' and the candidate enters-proceeds {{to the center of the}} room, where he flaps his two open hands at the top of his head, after the manner of a jackass flapping his ears, and takes his seat. These signs will give admission into any lodge of the Sons in the world, if they are properly given." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was left}} {{waiting for a}} few minutes outside the gate, then the <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> opened, and the sister {{requested}} him to follow her. Not a soul was to be seen as he traversed the gloomy courts and passed through several corridors to the room where the abbess was waiting him. In silence he handed to her the king's order. The abbess opened and read it.|$|E
60|$|The grounds are finely kept: winding paths invite to many {{a charming}} stroll. When about half way up, as {{the rain had}} {{partially}} subsided, I left the carriage, and toiled up the laborious steep on foot, that I might observe better. You approach the castle by a path cut through the rock for about thirty or forty feet. At last I stood under a low archway of solid stone masonry, about twenty feet thick. There had evidently been three successive doors; the outer one was gone, and the two inner were wonderfully massive, braced with iron, and having each a smaller <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> swung back on its hinges.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{their master}} underwent, in the {{retirement}} of his secret chamber, agonies that might have atoned {{for some of those}} which had been imposed by his command. He paced the room with short and unequal steps, often stood still and clasped his hands together, and gave loose, in short, to agitation, which in public he had found himself able to suppress so successfully. At length, pausing and wringing his hands, he planted himself opposite to the <b>wicket</b> <b>door,</b> which had been pointed out by old Mornay as leading {{to the scene of the}} murder of one of his predecessors, and gradually gave voice to his feelings in a broken soliloquy.|$|E
60|$|Delighted as Clarence felt, {{he was at}} {{the same}} time embarrassed. He could not {{understand}} the necessity of this mysterious rendezvous. He knew that if she was a scholar she was under certain conventual restraints; but with the privileges of his position and friendship with his teachers, he believed that Father Sobriente would easily procure him an interview with this old play-fellow, of whom he had often spoken, and who was, with himself, the sole survivor of his tragical past. And trusted as he was by Sobriente, there was something in this clandestine though innocent rendezvous that went against his loyalty. Nevertheless, he kept the appointment, and at the stated time was at the south wall of the convent, over which the gnarled boughs of the distinguishing pear-tree hung. Hard by in the wall was a grated <b>wicket</b> <b>door</b> that seemed unused.|$|E
