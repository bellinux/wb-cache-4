50|$|The Noose is {{a parody}} of local news {{programmes}} such as News 5 <b>Tonight,</b> <b>with</b> fictional news reports and a presentation mimicking that of the actual news bulletin. For example, every episode of News 5 <b>Tonight</b> <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> a CGI clock indicating the time, while every episode {{of the first two}} seasons of The Noose would spoof it by displaying the time using something more mundane, such as a plastic clock hanging on a wall or an alarm clock. At the beginning of every episode, there is a candid disclaimer, voiced by Andre Chichak (portrayed by Alaric Tay), telling the viewers that the stories are not true, most notably by using the line 'Believing us is like believing that...' (Eg, believing that drinking a certain energy drink (Red Bull) makes you fly).|$|R
