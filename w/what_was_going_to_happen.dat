5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

25|$|At 11:30 pm on {{the night}} of 27–28 January 1919, guards awoke Nicholas Mikhailovich, his brother George and his cousin Dimitri in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them they were to be moved and had to pack their belongings. They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to another place to be shot. They had an ominous hint of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to them when at the time of departure they were told to leave their luggage.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2011, Olympic {{news outlet}} Around the Rings {{reported}} that the AIBA unanimously approved the creation of its own professional boxing brand in addition to WSB.

25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an acrid level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{disagree}} {{on where to}} assign responsibility for the Indian actions. Francis Jennings contends that Montcalm anticipated <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> deliberately ignored it when it did happen, and stepped in only after the atrocities were well under way. In his opinion, the account by Bougainville, who left for Montreal {{on the night of}} 9 August and was not present at the massacre, was written as a whitewash to protect Montcalm. [...] Parkman is more vigorous in his defence of Montcalm, claiming that he and other French officers did what they could to prevent atrocities, but were powerless to stop the onslaught.|$|E

5000|$|According to Jason Scott, [...] "Archive Team {{was started}} out {{of anger and}} a feeling of powerlessness, this feeling that we were letting {{companies}} decide for us <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> survive and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die."Scott continues, [...] "it's not our job to figure out what's valuable, to figure out what's meaningful.

500|$|At {{the same}} meeting, {{options for the}} {{disposition}} of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all. Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews. He told Gilbert {{that he would never}} have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government," [...] he claimed.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Lucy Lawless was {{revealed}} {{to be involved in}} the second season. At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson. She definitely fit the bill on that front. Lucy has such a strength to her.

500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> It was kind of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game).

For a split-second as they're going back, I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, I pray to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something {{on the big screen}} pass.' But it was a good block, and it was a fun moment. Any time I hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide.

Duncan suddenly starts smashing his car before Meg comes out and talks to Duncan, criticizing him. Logan and Veronica are making out before Logan reveals an important piece of information—that he drugged Duncan, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> between them. Logan temporarily leaves Veronica before she notices a camera in the ceiling. She investigates further and finds a whole network of cameras, hinting that Logan was using them for some nefarious purpose.

500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{began the}} {{resolution}} of the story arc about Desmond's prophecy regarding Charlie's inevitable death, which began earlier in the season and would ultimately end in the finale. [...] The storyline was conceived while producing {{the latter part of the}} second season when the writers were brainstorming ideas for a new storyline for Charlie. [...] While Desmond could have had flashes of the future about anyone, Charlie was chosen over a less significant character so that the story would have higher stakes. [...] Additionally, the writers decided that it would be a great way to bring out the heroic side of Charlie, with Charlie being the only character to die willingly. [...] Despite the problems in Charlie's life, the writers believed that Charlie always was a good person and wanted to show that with the happiest moments of the character's life. [...] Monaghan thought that [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] was made [...] "to allow the audience to sit with [...] long enough to prepare themselves for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> [...] ".|$|E
500|$|On 6 December, the {{military}} {{stepped in to}} take control of matters.

[...] Vane did not appear that day—he either was aware of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> or he may have stayed away because his side had lost the vote. [...] This action, known as [...] "Pride's Purge", resulted in the exclusion of more than 140 MPs. [...] The Parliament that sat became known as the Rump Parliament, and its first main order of business was the trial and execution of King Charles. [...] During this process Vane refused to attend Parliament, although he was present as a spectator when the trial began on 20 January 1649. [...] He later claimed to oppose putting the king on trial because of [...] "tenderness of blood", and continued to fulfill the duties of his government posts, signing admiralty papers on the day Charles was executed.|$|E

500|$|Avatar {{received}} compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as [...] "the most evocative {{and amazing}} science-fiction movie since Star Wars" [...] and others calling it [...] "audacious and awe inspiring", [...] "master class", and [...] "brilliant". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian {{is also a}} noted fan of the film. On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: [...] "It's not in my top three James Cameron films.... t what point in the film {{did you have any}} doubt <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> next?". For French filmmaker Luc Besson, Avatar opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series Valérian and Laureline that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film. TIME ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of [...] "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)" [...] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list, and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.|$|E
500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to them.

Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden."
