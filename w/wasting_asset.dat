40|$|This {{paper will}} analyze the {{usefulness}} of depreciation expense to investors. Depreciation expense is a broad allocation accounting practice that treats different types of assets the same. I argue {{that there are two}} types of industries: those with <b>wasting</b> <b>assets,</b> and those with real property. The first type experiences true deprecation and deterioration while the second type of asset does not. A simplified model using the earnings response coefficient will measure the relationship between earnings and returns for these different industries; this measurement is a way to quantify usefulness of accounting information. I hypothesize that investors of companies with high <b>wasting</b> <b>assets</b> will find depreciation more useful than those invested in companies with more real property. However, the results were not consistent with my hypothesis – depreciation did not matter more to investors of the industry with high <b>wasting</b> <b>assets.</b> The data set only included two distinct industries, which limited the sample size considerably, and might explain the results. Alternatively, the two groups of assets could be defined more broadly to include more industries for future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} {{to the study}} {{is that of a}} continuously depreciating income accruing to producers of a <b>wasting</b> <b>asset,</b> oil. This income must be fully utilized in the short-run in order to attain a once and for all opportunity for rapid development. The concept of absorptive capacity can be extremely useful in determining how income can be productively employed {{to take advantage of this}} opportunity. The underlying factors for choosing these two particular Arab states are mainly because of their similarities, yet there are certain important disparities in their economic characteristics. Their similarities could be briefly summarised, in that both neighbouring countries belong to the oil - rich Gulf states, both are developing, both are under populated, with qualification in the case of Iraq, and both have to utilise fully the revenues from a rapidly depleting oil assets in a comparatively limited time span. Their differences are as great as their similarities, in that Iraq has had the benefit of oil revenues considerably longer than Kuwait, and that its economy is far more diverse, as agriculture was, and still is the main source of employment. This explains the reason underlying the magnitude of the impact that oil made on social fabric and the economic structure was far greater in Kuwait than in Iraq. In the introductory chapter the relevant definitions of the concept were examined, and the most viable one was chosen for the two countries. The limitations of the concept and the various methods of its measurement were considered and where possible, criticised. The methodology adopted was used as far as possible throughout the study. Chapters 2 and 3 dealt with the economies of Iraq and Kuwait consecutively as a necessary {{background to}} the discussion. Chapter 4 examined the concept within the context of the savings investment gap, and the conclusion which emerge from the available empirical evidence. The components of national income were examined, and analysed. In Chapter 5, an open-economy model was applied, as the aggregate level of economic activity in both Kuwait and Iraq is to a greater or lesser extent exogenonaly determined through their openness. In Chapter 6, the government revenue and expenditure was discussed, their determinants, considered and the two economies compared in the light of the differing priorities which the governments in Kuwait and Baghdad have. Finally, the concluding chapter attempted to synthesize the findings of the study its a summarised form of remarks concerning the absorptive capacity of the two economies...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} {{of this study}} is to explore and examine some of the ways which might enable the banking {{institutions}} in underdeveloped countries in general, and in Iraq in particular, to play a more effective part in the promotion of economic development. In the first chapter some important economic and social aspects of Iraq are displayed. In the second chapter some examination of the experiences of the Iraqi monetary authorities is made. The banking institutions in Iraq, i. e., the commercial and specialised banks, together with the central bank are discussed in chapter three. In this chapter, the possible contribution of the commercial banks in the promotion of economic development by providing medium and long-term loans to agriculture and industry is discussed. In addition, the possible ways in which some of the specialised banks might increase and improve their services are presented. In chapter four the device of deficit financing is applied to a model which represents underdeveloped countries in general. Chapter five offers an application of the device of deficit financing as shown in the model, adjusted to suit the circumstances prevailing in Iraq. Chapter six presents a consideration of the balance of advantage and disadvantage which may be thought to apply to the use of the device of deficit financing, especially when it is agreed that one of the possible outcomes is inflation. This is followed by chapter seven where the conclusions and recommendations reached in the light of the study are set out. We then have six appendices, including a statistical one. The main conclusions are: 1. It may be worthwhile for monetary authorities to consider, very carefully, the possibility of using the device of deficit financing, under certain conditions and within specified limits. 2. In calculating changes in prices the categories of the Quantity Theory of the Value of Money can be usefully employed, particularly if an attempt is made to introduce dynamic elements into the Fisher framework, as is done in this study. 3. It need not be held that moderate inflation must, necessarily, turn into high and hyper-inflation. 4. The commercial banks in under developed countries should give favourable consideration to the making of medium and long-term loans to agriculture and industry. 5. Under normal conditions, particularly of international trading, Iraq may be thought to be in a more favoured position to adopt the suggestions set out in (1) and (4) above, than most other underdeveloped countries. These are perhaps all the more significant for Iraq in that the natural resource, oil, which provides opportunity, is a diminishing or <b>wasting</b> <b>asset...</b>|$|E

Until Danish accounting legislation was changed as of January 1, 2002 companies were allowed to write-off goodwill or capitalize it subject to amortization, which provided a richer information set, as goodwill must be capitalized under most other accounting regimes. 1 The value relevance is tested by examining the association between goodwill (goodwill amortization) and share prices (share returns), incremental to other accounting variables. The overall findings suggest that investors perceive goodwill as an asset.
