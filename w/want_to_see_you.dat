25|$|Although {{the usage}} of 'not' in {{splitting}} infinitives {{is an issue that}} has not attracted much attention from the English users, contemporary English grammar puts the phrase into the same category as above. This appears to be because the traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (I soon learned not to provoke her) or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> anymore) remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction in British English. On the other hand, in the case of American English, a search on the corpus of contemporary American English displays a different aspect. Its usage is more commonly found in the American context, where we can find at least 2,200 cases of {{the usage of}} 'not' in splitting infinitives.|$|E

Author Ian Inglis observes a degree of [...] "understandable" [...] impatience in the first verse's line, [...] "Really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Lord, but it takes so long, my Lord". By {{the end of the}} song's second verse, Harrison declares a wish to [...] "know" [...] God also and attempts to reconcile the impatience: ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur J. Burks, the President of the American Fiction Guild, {{wrote that}} an excited Hubbard {{called him and}} said: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> right away.

[...] Hubbard {{believed}} that Excalibur would [...] "revolutionize everything" [...] and that [...] "it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the Bible." [...] It proposed that all human behavior could be {{explained in terms of}} survival and that to understand survival was to understand life. As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, [...] "the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology." ...|$|E
500|$|Inglis {{writes that}} the message of [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] is [...] "in the title". The theme of waiting is also central to a track that Harrison wrote in 1967 while in the Beatles, [...] "Blue Jay Way", and a similar {{sentiment}} appears in his 1970–71 solo hit [...] "My Sweet Lord", through the line [...] "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Lord, but it takes so long". In the latter lyric, Harrison expresses his impatience to see and know God, and Harrison biographer Geoffrey Giuliano interprets [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as a further reflection of the singer's spiritual concerns.|$|E
500|$|During the over, another rising Larwood {{delivery}} {{knocked the}} bat out of Woodfull's hands. He batted for 89 minutes, being hit {{a few more}} times before Allen bowled him for 22. Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E

500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> in it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|However, the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval was {{disastrous}} for Fingleton, who scored a pair as Australia were hammered by 338 runs. He was blamed for leaking {{the details of}} the dressing room exchange between captain Bill Woodfull and English manager Plum Warner, which almost caused the abandonment of the Test series. Warner had visited Woodfull to express sympathies after the Australian captain was struck in the heart by Larwood's short pitched bowling, to which Woodfull retorted [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> Mr. Warner. There are two sides out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The leak caused a sensastion, as Woodfull had publicly remained composed {{in the face of the}} body barrage, neither complaining nor retaliating. Fingleton was dropped for the remaining two Tests of the series. New South Wales played England after the Third Test and Fingleton had a chance to show his credentials against Bodyline but made only 19 and 7 in a four-wicket defeat, and was unable to force his way back into the Test team. Fingleton always denied responsibility for the leak, blaming Bradman. This incident was the first in a string of open disagreements between Fingleton and Bradman.|$|E
500|$|In 1932–33, great {{controversy}} erupted during England's tour of Australia. The visitors, captained by Douglas Jardine, used bodyline tactics—persistently {{aiming at}} the upper bodies and heads of the Australian batsmen {{in the hope of}} stifling the hosts' strong batting line-up. The Australian public and cricket community abhorred the tactic, but Woodfull refused to retaliate or complain publicly, despite some of his players wanting to do so. After the first Test, which Australia lost heavily, Woodfull was not confirmed as captain until just {{before the start of the}} next match, prompting speculation that the Australian Board of Control might remove him for refusing to retaliate. The controversy peaked during the third Test at the Adelaide Oval. Woodfull was felled by a blow to the heart, almost provoking a riot. After Woodfull was dismissed, English manager Plum Warner came to privately express his sympathy, to which Woodfull famously replied [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is playing cricket and the other is not." [...] The comment was leaked to the media and caused an uproar, after a teammate suffered a fractured skull, the Australian Board formally complained to English administrators about whether bodyline was sporting. This prompted threats of a trade boycott and a tour cancellation, so the Australian Board retracted. England completed a convincing 4–1 victory, but Woodfull was much praised for his stoic public behaviour. The Australian captain batted for 20 hours during the series, defying the bruising bowling for a longer time than any of his compatriots.|$|E

500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly, which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
