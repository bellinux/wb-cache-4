The case <b>where</b> <b>two</b> after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion.

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} <b>where</b> <b>two</b> seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory.
