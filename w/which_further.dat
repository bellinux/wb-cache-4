5|$|Among Sophocles' {{earliest}} innovations was {{the addition}} of a third actor, <b>which</b> <b>further</b> reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters.

Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of skenographia, or scenery-painting. It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre-eminent playwright in Athens.|$|E
