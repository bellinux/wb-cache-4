500|$|The {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} was Michael J. McAlister (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Willow) with Mark Stetson (Superman Returns, Peter Pan) as miniatures supervisor. Peter Chesney, mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films, created {{a pair of}} 16-foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning, who portrayed Waring Hudsucker. [...] "I made a complicated steel armature {{with a lot of}} electric motors to time everything so he can fold up his wings, unfold them and flap them about. Then <b>we</b> <b>covered</b> them with real duck and turkey feathers," [...] says Chesney. [...] "We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion." [...] The buildings in the background (designed by McAlister and Stetson) were 1:24 scale models, shot separately and merged in post-production. To lengthen the sequence, the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories, not 45.|$|E
2500|$|A {{skateboard}} park briefly existed, {{near the}} ski area's ski school building, but closed due to poor design after a season. Bowls {{were separated by}} pavement, which in many cases {{did not meet the}} edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine Weird NJ saying that the [...] "skate park was responsible for so many injuries <b>we</b> <b>covered</b> it up with dirt and pretended it never existed".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{attributed}} this to its sonic {{difference with}} its predecessors, however, Mike Patton credits it to being [...] "better at playing what [...] hear in [...] heads" [...] {{and went on}} to say that [...] "before, we used to kinda cheat around, and play around what it was. We could never translate it into the band, and we're getting better at doing that. Like, we wanted to do a real lazy, sappy kinda ballad, so <b>we</b> <b>covered</b> the theme from Midnight Cowboy! And there's even a song that sounds like The Carpenters!" [...] In a trend that started when then-vocalist Chuck Mosley lived in Los Angeles while the rest of the band resided in the Bay Area, the band would record demo tapes of the songs and exchange them between each other in Los Angeles before sending them to Jim Martin so that he could work on his guitar arrangements after which he would send them back for approval.|$|E
5000|$|Claro was {{introduced}} in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua in September 2006 as a rebranding of the former PCS Digital, Alo, Personal and Enitel. Slogans such as [...] "Cubrimos tus Momentos, Cubrimos tus Lugares, Cubrimos tu Nación, Cubrimos tu Diversión, Cubrimos El Salvador. Siempre estás cubierto con Claro." [...] ("We <b>cover</b> your moments, <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> your places, <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> your nation, <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> your entertainment, <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> El Salvador. You are always covered with Claro.") and [...] "Hablamos de todo... Hablamos Claro." [...] ("We talk about everything... We talk 'Clear' 'Claro'.") {{have been used in}} El Salvador. In Honduras, [...] "Hablamos de todo... Hablamos Claro." [...] ("We talk about everything... We talk 'Clear' 'Claro'.") and [...] "Claro que tienes más." [...] ("Of course you have more.") are two slogans that have been used. [...] "Claro. La vida en tus manos." [...] ("Of course (claro). Life is in your hands.") and [...] "Claro que si." [...] ("Yes, of course") have been used in Nicaragua.|$|R

40|$|In {{this session}} {{we look at}} how to model flow of control and {{interactions}} between components using UML Activity and Sequence Diagrams. This is an introductory session and so for Activity Diagrams <b>we</b> only <b>cover</b> branching, forks and joins and swim lanes, and for Sequence <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> lifelines, messages and returns, and alt, par and opt frames...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{increased}} demand for GaAs substrates, improved physical characteristics such as warp, flatness, local thickness variation and other parameters are required.

In this article <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> warp and bow, in part II next issue we report on total thickness variation (TTV) and total indication reading (TIR), and then in the concluding part <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> local thickness variation (LTV) and percentage local thickness variation (PLTV) ...|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>covered</b> twenty-two miles by sundown, {{a rather}} poor day's showing; and camped {{on the bare}} flat desert, using water and wood we had packed with us. The last thing I remembered, as my eyes closed heavily, was what a blessing it was to rest and to sleep.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Haskell {{provides}} a {{rich set of}} abstractions for parallel and concurrent programming. This tutorial covers the basic concepts involved in writing parallel and concurrent programs in Haskell, and takes a deliberately practical approach: most of the examples are real Haskell programs that you can compile, run, measure, modify and experiment with. <b>We</b> <b>cover</b> parallel programming with the Eval monad, Evaluation Strategies, and the Par monad. On the concurrent side, <b>we</b> <b>cover</b> threads, MVars, asynchronous exceptions, Software Transactional Memory, the Foreign Function Interface, and briefly look at the construction of high-speed network servers in Haskell. ...|$|R

60|$|Silently {{we dropped}} to the deserted deck, and {{on hands and knees}} crawled toward the hatchway. A {{stealthy}} glance below revealed no guard in sight, and so with the quickness and the soundlessness of cats we dropped together into the main cabin of the submarine. Even here was no sign of life. Quickly <b>we</b> <b>covered</b> and secured the hatch.|$|E
60|$|Hard riding {{had been}} {{the order of the}} day, but still <b>we</b> <b>covered</b> ten more miles by sundown. The canyon {{apparently}} closed in on us, so camp was made for the night. The horses were staked out, and supper made ready while the shadows were dropping; and when darkness settled thick over us, we lay under our blankets.|$|E

Guided by the instructor, each student will prepare and deliver a substantial presentation covering both the fundamentals of a KRR approach, and one or more recent and prominent research results related to it. Emphasis is put on controversial discussion in class of the value of state-of-the-art research for future developments of the field...|$|R

60|$|He {{dismissed}} {{the driver and}} drove himself. We jogged along quietly while in the station; {{but as soon as}} we got to the dusty road across the plains, he made that pony fly.

60|$|Eve glided {{instantly}} towards us, {{went down}} on her knees, and printed a long passionate kiss on the cold forehead. Then the Indian looked at me, and we lifted the body into the grave.

60|$|Then we set {{the table}} with all the nice dishes we could find.

At one o'clock dinner was ready for us and we for it. Very nice that table looked, too, as we sat down to it.|$|E
60|$|At midnight all was over, {{and we sat}} in the {{presence}} of four corpses. <b>We</b> <b>covered</b> them with such rags as we could find, and started away, fastening the door behind us. Their home must be these people's grave, for they could not have Christian burial, or be admitted to consecrated ground.
