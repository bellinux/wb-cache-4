25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the <b>World</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In,</b> and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E
500|$|In {{the best-selling}} 1955 nature book {{published}} by Time-Life called The <b>World</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In,</b> {{there is an}} artist's impression of Pleione entitled Purple Pleione. The illustration is from the famed space artist Chesley Bonestell and carries the caption: [...] "Purple Pleione, a star of the familiar Pleiades cluster, rotates so rapidly that it has flattened into a flying saucer and hurled forth a dark red ring of hydrogen. Where the excited gas crosses Pleione's equator, it obscures her violet light." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear.

40|$|Context-aware {{systems are}} ones that have a greater {{awareness}} of the physical and social <b>worlds</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> Such systems make use of sensing technologies, recognition algorithms, and wireless networking to enhance human safety, add convenience, improve efficiency, and augment how we find and remember information. However, context-aware systems are currently very difficult to build. Presently, there is little support for building such context-aware systems in a robust and reliable manner. As a result, developers must deal {{with a wide range}} of systems issues incidental to the construction of context-aware applications before even simple context-aware applications can be built. These issues include specifying context needs, discovering available sensors that can address these context needs, acquiring data from these sensors, applying fusion algorithms to improve the reliability of sensor data, employing recognition algorithms to transform low-level sensor data into higher- level context da [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{abstract}} metaphysics {{provides us}} with a world of beauty and purpose and various other [...] "highers", it condemns other key aspects of the <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive {{to learn about the}} world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares our place in the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and pessimism.|$|E

[...] However, Turan explained that [...] "no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy {{are not interested in}} violence for its own sake, but for what it says about the <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> ...

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a specific human right - the right {{to work in a}} safe environment. It sets out a case for developing a new form of account of health and safety in any organisational setting. It draws upon the theoretical insights of Pierre Bourdieu taking inspiration from his assertion that {{in order to understand the}} "logic" of the <b>worlds</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>we</b> need to immerse ourselves into the particularity of an empirical reality. In this case the paper, analyses a preventable industrial disaster which occurred in Glasgow, Scotland which killed nine people and injured 33 others. From this special case of what is possible, the paper unearths the underlying structures of symbolic violence of the UK State, the Health and Safety Executive and capital with respect to health and safety at work. While dealing with one specific country (Scotland), the analysis can be used to question health and safety regimes and other forms of symbolic violence across the globe...|$|R
