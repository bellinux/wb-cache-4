5|$|On the January 5, 2012 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne {{retained}} their tag team titles against James and Traci Brooks. Three days later at Genesis, Kim defeated James by disqualification {{to retain the}} Knockouts Championship. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Kim successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Tara, during which Madison Rayne walked out on her Knockouts Tag Team Championship partner. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Rayne won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Kim's Knockouts Championship. In the following weeks, tension between Kim and Rayne began to be teased with the two negatively interfering in each other's matches. On the March 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Eric Young and ODB. On March 18 at Victory Road, Kim successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Rayne. On the March 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim and Rayne reconciled and remained together as a team. On April 15 at Lockdown, Kim defeated Velvet Sky in a steel cage match, following a distraction from Rayne, to retain her title. Afterwards, Kim went on a losing streak against Brooke Tessmacher, which led to TNA naming Tessmacher the number one contender to her title. On May 13 at Sacrifice, Kim defeated Tessmacher, pinning her <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> on the ropes, for another successful title defense. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Kim successfully defended her title against Tessmacher and Velvet Sky in a three-way match. On May 20, Kim became the longest reigning TNA Knockouts Champion in history by breaking Madison Rayne's previous record of 188 days. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Kim lost the title to Miss Tessmacher, ending her reign at 210 days. Kim received her rematch for the title on the July 12 episode of Impact Wrestling, but was again defeated by Tessmacher.|$|E
25|$|A Chukchi tale {{contains}} {{almost the}} same series of motifs (except for the incest and the infanticide at the beginning). The Chukchi tale begins with the girl's finding a skull incidentally. Besides that, in the Chukchi tale, the girl, just after having been abandoned by her parents, begins to accuse the skull and push it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> rudely. And on the visit of her returning parents, she seemingly forgives them, but kills them by deceit.|$|E
25|$|Belief in {{the supernatural}} is strong {{in all parts}} of India, and lynchings for {{witchcraft}} are reported in the press from time to time. Around 750 people were killed as witches in Assam and West Bengal between 2003 and 2008. Officials in the state of Chhattisgarh reported in 2008 that at least 100women are maltreated annually as suspected witches. A local activist stated that only a fraction of cases of abuse are reported. In Indian mythology, a common perception of a witch is a being <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> pointed backwards.|$|E

500|$|At the April 2012 Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Swimming Trials in Montreal, Mortimer {{aimed to}} lower her {{world record in}} the 50-metre {{freestyle}} from 28.30 seconds to about 28.27; she finished in 28.17 seconds. Between the Trials and the Paralympics, she won the 100-metre backstroke in July at the Canada Cup; this result surprised Mortimer, who had a [...] "rough time" [...] <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> the previous month. That month, she also won the women's 100-metre S10 at the Speedo Paraswimming CAN-AM in Winnipeg.|$|E
500|$|In {{the role}} of belly dancer, Steinberg engaged in {{dramatic}} interaction with Bono, especially upon entrance and exit from the stage. At times Bono would sing to the belly dancer's image on the giant video screens around the stage. During the tour, Steinberg changed the colours of her outfit to match certain occasions, such as wearing orange and black around Halloween. Steinberg was originally reluctant to put her own activities on hold to continue on to the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg of the tour, but eventually agreed. Unlike others in the tour entourage, Steinberg exhibited a professional independence from the group and did not wait on their whims. In 1993, while still on tour, Steinberg appeared in U2's Kevin Godley-directed music video for their single [...] "Numb", first <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> {{as part of the}} video's assault on The Edge and then with her back as she belly danced.|$|E
500|$|Oviri (...) is an 1894 ceramic {{sculpture}} by French artist Paul Gauguin, the original cast {{is in the}} Musée d'Orsay. Gauguin shows her with long pale hair and large wild eyes. In Tahitian mythology Oviri was the goddess of mourning. Gauguin shows her either smothering or embracing a wolf <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> as she tightly clutches another wolf cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations of the work; usually that he intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a [...] "civilised savage". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a 'master of animals' type and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java.|$|E

500|$|Although she was {{initially}} criticised for being inconsistent {{at the beginning}} of career, and for losing possession too easily, Lloyd later developed into one of {{the best players in the}} world, and is highly regarded in particular for her outstanding determination, mental strength, and work-ethic. A tenacious, energetic, and hard-working player, she also is known for her control, technique, and passing accuracy, and is capable of aiding her team both defensively and offensively, due to her stamina, strength, and tackling, as well as her ability to get into good attacking positions, and either score goals or create chances for teammates. These abilities, coupled with her tactical versatility, enable her to be deployed in several midfield positions; although she began her career in the centre, as a defensive midfielder, she is most comfortable when moved to a more advanced role, as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards. Lloyd has also earned a reputation as a [...] "clutch player", due to her tendency to score decisive goals; a powerful striker of the ball, she is capable of scoring from any position on the pitch, and can finish well both with her head and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> inside the area.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, {{appears to have been}} desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop, and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied [...] "to your father this is a toy shop." [...] Lord Rosebery's friend Edward Hamilton recorded her [...] "notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies." [...] It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> firmly on the ground. She made herself the link between the world and her [...] "thin skinned and neurotic" [...] husband. While her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation, she came to the forefront to plead his case or cause. If she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{depiction}} in the 12th-century English Eadwine Psalter has a naked female swimmer {{in the water}}, {{holding the}} empty ark with one hand, while a clothed female <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> in the water holds out the baby to the princess, who reclines on a bed or litter. [...] This is part of some 11 scenes {{of the life of}} Moses. [...] This may relate to the Jewish visual traditions covered below.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{campaign}} Essex had wilfully abused his power by dubbing 59 knights, and the Queen announced that [...] "it is doubted {{that if he}} continues this course he will shortly bring in tag and rag, cut and long-tail, and so bring the order into contempt". But she failed to curtail her commander and, according to her godson [...] Sir John Harington, raged impotently at the news from Ireland: [...] "She walks much in her privy chamber and stamps <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> at ill news, and thrusts her rusty sword at times into the arras in great rage." [...] She could take no more and on 30 July 1599 ordered an immediate attack on O'Neill.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was also}} {{constantly}} considering the manners {{of the people}} and the differences between the English and the French (and later, to a lesser extent, the Italians and Swiss). Did the French really have a [...] "butterfly, airy, thoughtless, fluttering character"? He was forced to revise his opinions repeatedly. In some ways the French seemed superior to his countrymen. Unlike the English, he discovered, the French attended the theatre reverently, respectfully, [...] "the attention ... like that of a learned society to a lecture on some scientific subject". And he found culture more widespread among the working classes: [...] "You see an apple-girl in Paris, sitting at a stall <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> over a stove in the coldest weather, or defended from the sun by an umbrella, reading Racine and Voltaire".|$|E
60|$|The indignant captain edged her off {{the side}} of his chair; Miss Nugent, quite undisturbed, got on again and sat tapping the floor <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> <b>Her</b> arm stole round his neck and she laid her cheek against his head and smiled wickedly.|$|R

2500|$|The {{company has}} also used pornographic actors and glamour models {{in some of}} its ads {{including}} Lauren Phoenix, Charlotte Stokely, Sasha Grey, Euguenia Diyordiychuk and Faye Reagan. Adult entertainment trade magazine Adult Video News cited the American Apparel website as [...] "one of the finer softcore websites going." [...] Some of the company's other ads, which feature nudity or sexual themes, have been banned by various advertising authorities. In 2009, an American Apparel ad which appeared in VICE Magazine was banned in the UK, because the image [...] "could be seen to sexualise a model {{who appears to be}} a child". American Apparel complied with this ruling. American Apparel also came under fire for a 2014 ad for mini-skirts, which featured a model bending over so that her underwear was prominently exposed. In 2013, the company released an ad in which the model lay on a bed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> up in the air without wearing pants. The company also released an ad in which a model posed in a series of photos focused on her crotch, in which her face was not seen. The UK Advertising Standards Authority criticized the ad for being [...] "voyeuristic," [...] and [...] "vulnerable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{fighting}} style {{focuses on}} the [...] "power and range" [...] of kicks. As a practitioner of taekwondo, she fights almost exclusively <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and rarely strikes with her hands. She {{has been described as}} [...] "agile and quick, but with low stamina." [...] Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as a unique character, comparing her to a [...] "Guilty Gear type of character," [...] citing her dive kicks in part for this. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that she is a character who is [...] "geared towards competitive players who enjoy screwing with their opponents' minds just as much as they enjoy slugging them in the face." [...] GamesRadar also described her as a character who [...] "functions best when she’s on the offensive and shutting down opponents before they can even get into position." [...] Developer Okada described her as a [...] "hectic character," [...] a quality that the developers had decided on from the beginning. She was created with the intention of making players see her as a character with potential; Okada commented that he wanted to instill a feeling of [...] "If I keep playing with this character, I bet I could do some really cool stuff" [...] in players. Developer Tamamura commented that players of Yun and Yang from Street Fighter III would enjoy playing with her. Seth Killian, Capcom Special Advisor to Super Street Fighter IV, described Juri as [...] "one of the most versatile characters." [...] He commented that she is a threat from mid-range as well as further away because of her dive kick, but theorized that characters like Zangief, Ryu, and Sagat would give Juri trouble due to their mobility and hard-hitting attacks.|$|E
