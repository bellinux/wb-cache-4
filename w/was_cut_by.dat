5|$|During the voyage, {{the ship}} {{encounters}} a supernova. Jim, while securing lifelines of all crew members, saves Silver from falling just in time. The supernova then devolves {{into a black}} hole, where Arrow falls. The burst of shock waves and maximum engine power enable Amelia to pilot the ship to safety. Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E
5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E

5|$|A first {{opening of}} the bridge {{took place in the}} same day with the ceremonies for the {{national}} day on July 14, 1897, in the presence of governor Chabié. The ribbon for the access zone <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the governor's wife, then the officials walked a short distance to the mobile deck, which was opened to allow the passage of the military ship L'Ardent. 21 cannon shots were fired at dusk and dawn to commemorate the construction of the bridge and on that day there were organised ceremonies including horse races and donkey races. The second opening was on October 19, 1897, in the presence of André Lebon, the prime minister of the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E

The fourth-generation iPad was reintroduced on March 18, 2014, following the discontinuation of the iPad 2. In order to make its reintroduction a low-end device to the iPad Air, its price <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> 20% over its original launch price. On October 16, 2014, the fourth-generation iPad was discontinued in favor of the iPad Air 2; the iPad Air took its place as the entry-level iPad at that time.|$|E
5|$|Heikkinen {{signed on}} as an {{assistant}} coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for more flexibility in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> 16 games.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E
5|$|Selänne {{returned}} to the Ducks in 2008–09 and signed a two-year contract. He missed several {{weeks of the season}} due to a quad muscle injury suffered when he <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> his own skate following a hit by Denis Grebeshkov of the Edmonton Oilers, but appeared in 65 games and scored 54 points. He played his 1,100th game during the season, became the sixth European player to score 1,200 career points and appeared in his 100th career playoff game. Selänne reached additional milestones in 2009–10, as he became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals, accomplishing the feat on March 21, 2010, against the Colorado Avalanche and upon scoring his 602nd goal on April 2 against the Vancouver Canucks, surpassing his childhood idol, Jari Kurri.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{operation of the}} fleet was made more cost effective when maintaince and support regimes were altered in 2006–7. On 15 December 2009 the British government announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of 24 new build Chinooks, 22 to expand the force and two to replace losses in Afghanistan, to be delivered to the Royal Air Force from 2012. The number of additional Chinooks <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> 12 with the October 2010 defence review, however. This will bring the total fleet size to 60 aircraft; as of 2009, the RAF had 48 Chinooks in inventory.|$|E
5|$|This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it {{had sold}} 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 {{computers}} were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. When sales fell {{in the wake of}} the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre-assembled version to £49.95 in May 1982. It <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>by</b> another £10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold.|$|E
