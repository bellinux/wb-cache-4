5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version of <b>Windows</b> <b>that</b> Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of <b>Windows</b> <b>that</b> is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in his left hand, and a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E

The player characters must defend Earth from this alien threat and restore human civilization. ProtoGalaxy is a 2.5D game; the 2D playing field employs 3D graphics. ProtoGalaxy incorporates elements of a variety of gaming genres, such as adventure, arcade, shooter, puzzle, and role-playing genres.|$|E
5|$|Across Florida, damage totaled $27.75million (1950USD), {{of which}} $15million {{was in the}} Miami {{metropolitan}} area. The hurricane damaged 20,861houses in southern Florida, 580 of them severely. Additionally, 248trailer homes were damaged, 188 of them severely. A total of 248houses or trailers were destroyed in the Miami area. A preliminary survey indicated there were about 2,000store <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> were broken during the storm. In West Hollywood, a town of 2,000people located north of Miami, strong winds destroyed or severely damaged about 150houses, leaving hundreds homeless. At the Broward County airport in Fort Lauderdale, the winds damaged 55buildings and destroyed one plane. Further north, damage was lighter in Palm Beach, consisting of downed trees and flooded streets. Along its path through the state, strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee, with a 93mph (150km/h) gust in Clewiston. In Orlando, the winds destroyed the roof of an airport hangar.|$|E
5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
5|$|Players {{may only}} be {{transferred}} during transfer <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> are set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from {{the last day of}} the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.|$|E

5|$|Several hôtels particuliers (large townhouses) {{date from}} the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> are {{characteristic}} of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these hôtels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey {{and it has a}} large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later hôtels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.|$|E
5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical in design and layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper floor}} {{contained}} a grand {{hall in the}} west and residential chamber in the eastboth originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the walland StJohn's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15thcentury, along with the present roof. StJohn's Chapel {{was not part of the}} White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during HenryIII's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>that</b> depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity.|$|E
