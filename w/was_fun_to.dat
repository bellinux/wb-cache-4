5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt {{little more than an}} extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|The dramas feature {{background}} music composed by Takeshi Abo, who previously composed {{the music for}} the Steins;Gate game, and cover art by the game's character designer Huke.

5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

Ward later {{noted in the}} DVD commentary that while the episode <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write, once the episode was finalized, the storyline involving kissing came out [...] "weird" [...] and [...] "gross".|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger did {{not enter}} the {{recording}} studio with a specific plan on what they wanted Vulture Street to be, but that they [...] "felt that [...] {{wanted to write a}} rock album". In the end, the album became [...] "stuff that makes you want to jump around and feel good about yourself"—guitarist Darren Middleton said this had not been the band's intention.

500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Crumb {{denied any}} {{personal}} {{attachment to the}} character, stating, [...] "I just got into drawing him... He <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> draw." [...] As Crumb's personal life changed, Fritz would too. According to Pahls, [...] "For years, [...] had few friends and no sex life; {{he was forced to}} spend many hours at school or on the job, and when he came home he 'escaped' by drawing home-made comics. When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the 'compensation' factor went out of his drawing, and this was pretty much the end of Fritz's impetus." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by British-Irish girl group The Saturdays, taken from their first EP, Headlines!. Written by Alexander Kronlund and Lukas Hilbert with production from Hilbert and James Reynolds, the song was released as the collection's lead single on 8 August 2010 as a digital download and on 9 August as a CD single. The lyrics centre on being in a relationship where the passion has died, but still being addicted to the love that used to exist. It features an electropop production, incorporating elements of synthpop. The group described the song as [...] "an updated version of their sound" [...] and <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> record and experiment with.

500|$|Enter the Dominatrix {{received}} [...] "mixed or average reviews", {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Chris Schilling of Eurogamer, citing the game's development history, called Enter the Dominatrix [...] "a fascinating {{case study in}} how games evolve". Electronic Gaming Monthly Eric Patterson also commented on how downloadable content in the industry is seen as content pulled from the retail release to be sold as an addition, which Enter the Dominatrix development history flips on its head. He added that {{in all of his}} industry experience, he had never otherwise seen a developer purposefully let its fans play [...] "shelved" [...] content, and thus found the experience [...] "fascinating". Official Xbox Magazine Mikel Reparaz said it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see what [...] "could have been".|$|E
500|$|As {{teenagers}} {{were among}} the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) [...] "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s". The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of [...] "kids us them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down." [...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. They said he <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E
500|$|... "The Bishop Revival" [...] {{revealed}} that the seahorse shown in promotions since the series began {{was in fact a}} genetically encoded [...] "signature" [...] created by Walter's father Dr. Robert Bishop. In an interview after the episode's broadcast, consulting producer Akiva Goldsman cited [...] "The Bishop Revival" [...] when discussing the use of flashbacks in Fringe; he stated his disinclination to use too many flashbacks in the series, explaining [...] "I think flashbacks are really useful and {{there are a couple of}} places where it will be useful. But fundamentally, no, I don't think we're a show that will be doing a lot of jumping back in time despite the single horde of calls for the 'Walter's Grandfather Nazi Hunting' series. I think not, but it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{time travel}} thriller film {{originated}} between screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, who communicated via email in attempts to develop the plot due to communication difficulties. However, the creation of Déjà Vus progenitor was set aside by the September 11, 2001 attacks that disrupted New York-native Marsilii, {{and the advent of}} the 2003 film , which occupied Los Angeles-native Rossio. However, by 2006, the two screenwriters had completed the concept. Brian Greene from Columbia University was brought in as a consultant to help create a scientifically plausible feel to the script. Greene stated [...] "the way I try to explain wormholes in terms of bending paper and connecting the corners, that's there in the film and it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see that that made it in." [...] The screenwriters submitted their work to Jerry Bruckheimer, who with Tony Scott were searching for new ideas for a feature film.|$|E
