Decapitated recorded Blood Mantra during March in Hertz Studio in Poland, and released the album in September. During a tour in United States in October, the band was involved in serious van accident {{on the way to}} a show in New Orleans, Louisiana.

500|$|The {{group was}} popular among rebellious youths, who were {{attracted}} to, as Asiaweek put it, [...] "the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered." [...] Their music {{was described by}} Asiaweek as having [...] "an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society." [...] In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained [...] "In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they dress like it, they breathe it." [...] In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, [...] "but eventually <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> 20 million albums, so they had no choice." ...|$|E

500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative. Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing {{what we thought was}} funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> out." [...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and has been described as one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E
500|$|Sabotage {{reached the}} top 20 in both the US and the UK, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US, only {{achieving}} Gold certification. Although the album's only single [...] "Am I Going Insane (Radio)" [...] failed to chart, Sabotage features fan favourites such as [...] "Hole in the Sky", and [...] "Symptom of the Universe". Black Sabbath toured in support of Sabotage with openers Kiss, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band, titled <b>We</b> <b>Sold</b> Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the US.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{worldwide}} popularity, {{the band}} has remained protective {{of how their}} music {{is used in the}} media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs [...] "Yellow", [...] "Trouble", and [...] "Don't Panic" [...] respectively. According to frontman, Chris Martin, [...] "We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> the songs' meanings like that." [...] The song [...] "Viva la Vida" [...] was featured in a commercial for the iTunes Store, advertising its exclusive availability of the single as a digital download on iTunes. Additionally, Chris Martin appeared at an Apple Inc. Special Event on 1 September 2010, playing a number of songs, and also thanked Apple for their assistance in marketing [...] "Viva la Vida". After the death of Steve Jobs, Coldplay performed four songs at Apple's Campus in Cupertino, further thanking Jobs for the support he gave them.|$|E

500|$|Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is {{the first}} English {{language}} film and the first big studio production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, {{up to this point}} best known for his 2009 Nazi zombie-themed, independent horror comedy film Dead Snow. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And they took me to Paramount two days after and <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release. These figures were {{acknowledged}} as disappointing, and described as awful by Kulas. [...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition should at least be breaking even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before that, when we did Descent for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [...] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like Wolfenstein [...] or something.".|$|E

He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of Ultramega OK the band signed with A Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its {{traditional}} audience. Thayil said, [...] "In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us when they thought <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> out the punk tenets, getting on a major label and touring with Guns N' Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture." [...] The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused {{a shift in the}} band's songwriting process, according to Cornell: [...] "At the time Hiro [...] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] On September 5, 1989, the band released its second album, Louder Than Love, which saw it take [...] "a step toward the metal mainstream," [...] according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, describing it as [...] "a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing". Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Big Dumb Sex", the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release. Louder Than Love became the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a {{complaint}} claiming that the Hammond Company made [...] "false and misleading" [...] claims in advertisements for its organ, including that the Hammond could produce [...] "the entire range of tone coloring of a pipe organ". The complaint resulted in lengthy hearing proceedings, which featured a series of auditory tests that pitted a Hammond costing about $2600 against a $75,000 Skinner pipe organ in the University of Chicago Rockefeller Chapel. During the auditory tests, sustained tones and excerpts from musical works were played on the electric and pipe organs while a group of musicians and laymen attempted {{to distinguish between the}} instruments. While attorneys for Hammond argued that the test listeners were wrong or guessed nearly half the time, witnesses for the FTC claimed that Hammond employees had unfairly manipulated the Skinner organ to sound more like the Hammond. In 1938, the FTC ordered Hammond to [...] "cease and desist" [...] a number of advertising claims, including that its instrument was equivalent to a $10,000 pipe organ. After the FTC's decision, Hammond claimed that the hearings had vindicated his company's assertions that the organ produced [...] "real", [...] "fine", and [...] "beautiful" [...] music, phrases which were each cited in the FTC's original complaint, but not included in the [...] "cease and desist" [...] order. Hammond also claimed that although the hearing was expensive for his company, the proceedings generated so much publicity that [...] "as a result <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> enough extra organs to cover the expense." ...|$|E

[...] Marmalade guitarist Junior Campbell stated in interview that [...] "Jimi Hendrix's version had already sold about 200,000 copies and then <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> about 300,000 on the flip of 'Lovin' Thing'.

2500|$|The total {{production}} budget was [...] About 70% {{of the budget}} was covered when IM Global, a finance and sales company backed by Reliance, sold film rights to various distributors at the American Film Market in November 2010. The budget was further covered by tax breaks provided for filming in Alaska and in New Zealand. IM Global covered only 15% of the budget directly. Forbes called Walking with Dinosaurs an independent film with an unconventionally large budget since the production did not originate at a major studio. Nightingale explained, [...] "It was originally funded by... Reliance, and then <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> it pretty quickly to 20th Century Fox {{for most of the}} world, and to a range of other distributors in a few other countries, and that's not an unusual path for an independent film — in other words, a non-studio film which doesn't originate from a big studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving {{because of its}} scope and severity.... By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. <b>We</b> <b>sold</b> short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|When Faith No More {{was brought}} up in a 1999 {{interview}} with The A.V.

I think if it had continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line must be drawn there." [...] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated that the band had broken up [...] "because we were starting to make bad music." [...] However, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton {{on the quality of the}} band's late material, stating in 1998 [...] "However many records <b>we</b> <b>sold</b> or didn't, we maintained over a long [...] period of time a high standard of music that we're proud of, and we never sucked.
