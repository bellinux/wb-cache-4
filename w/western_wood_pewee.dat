40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Ninety-one {{species of}} birds were {{surveyed}} in grass/forb, early and late shrub/sapling, pole, and medium sawtimber stages of young-growth Douglas-fir in northwestern California; patterns of bird distribution and abundance were related to habitat conditions and even-age silvicultural treatments. Seven species (band-tailed pigeon, <b>western</b> <b>wood</b> <b>pewee,</b> dusky flycatcher, western bluebird, fox sparrow, purple finch, and evening grosbeak) have probably increased in population size or distribution since extensive clearcutting {{in the study area}} began in the early 1950 's. Six species (Hammond's flycatcher, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet, and hermit warbler) are restricted to forest stages and probably have decreased in population size or distribution. Abundances of various species were associated with presence of a forest overstory, hardwood stem density, deciduous foliage volume, height and patchiness of shrub cover, number plant species, and snag density. Slope angle and distance to permanent water or to the next nearest similar habitat type explained some variation in abundance of a few species. The grass/forb stage had the lowest number of bird species and lowest total density, while the late shrub/sapling stage had the highest; species composition varied markedly across the young-growth stages. Cluster analysis defined Shrub stage specialists and forest stage Specialists. Seasonal patterns of permanent resident species suggested that the shrub stage specialists are most limited in distribution during winter, and that their winter distributions may reflect optimal ("source") habitat. In contrast, forest stage specialists showed no seasonal changes of distribution, or were more restricted in distribution during the breeding season. All phases of the clearcutting system, including site preparation, stocking control, intermediate treatments, and final harvest, greatly affect stand conditions. No one stand condition, young-growth stage, or silvicultural treatment provided best habitat for all bird species. Simplification of forest stand structure by reduction or elimination of hardwoods, snags, and large diameter softwoods, could lead to low within-stand but high between-stand diversity of vegetation and bird assemblages. Even-age silvicultural systems, however, can integrate management objectives for timber production and bird habitat...|$|E
50|$|The least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) {{is quite}} similar to the eastern <b>wood</b> <b>pewee</b> in plumage, but has a bold eye ring and much shorter primary projection, {{appearing}} rather blunt-winged. It also has a shorter bill and is smaller overall. The songs (che-bec, che-bec) and calls (a sharp whit) are very different.|$|R
50|$|Its numbers, however, {{are declining}} in recent decades, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} loss of forest habitat in its winter range. It is also possible that the increase of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in its breeding range has led to a change in vegetation and associated invertebrates in the lower levels of the deciduous forests where the eastern <b>wood</b> <b>pewee</b> breeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{eastern phoebe}} (Sayornis phoebe) is similar, {{particularly}} in the worn plumage after breeding. It always lacks clearly defined wingbars, however, and bobs its tail frequently. It has a shorter primary projection. The eastern phoebe is also present on the breeding grounds by March, while eastern <b>wood</b> <b>pewees</b> don't arrive until very late April and early May. The songs (fee-bee, fee-bee) and calls (chip) are quite different.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>wood</b> <b>pewee</b> (Contopus virens) is {{extremely}} similar in appearance. It lacks the buff hue usually {{present on the}} lighter parts of the eastern phoebe's plumage, and thus has always clearly defined and contrasting wing-bars.

50|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} deciduous, mixed woods, or pine plantations in eastern North America. These birds migrate to Central America {{and in the}} Andes region of northern South America.
