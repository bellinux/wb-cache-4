25|$|The flag of Guayama {{is made up}} {{of three}} stripes of {{different}} colors: black, yellow, and red from top to bottom. The black stands for the enslaved Africans brought to Puerto Rico, many to Guayama. The yellow represents sugar cane industry in Puerto Rico and the significance of Guayama's sugar plantations. The red symbolizes the blood shed by Taíno Indians in their fight against the Spanish/European colonizers. To the left of the top stripe <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Old Mill, which today is known as the Molino de Vives.|$|E
25|$|Another stylistic choice {{she makes}} is {{frequently}} beginning with an epigraph from the written {{records of the}} long assault on Native Peoples. Often she uses this epigraph from the historical, archeological world, as a jumping off point for her poetry which is narrated by a Native-identified voice, allowing for the reader to draw {{the connection between the}} two. This juxtaposition brings the “historical artifact” of bone or cloth to life and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> skin being literally ripped away with the language of the poetry and giving the casual observer a real vision of that object.|$|E
500|$|Barbree was so {{interested}} in the space program, that he paid for his own ticket to get to Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1957, and watched the attempted Vanguard launch. The failed launch was one Barbree would never forget: [...] "There's ignition. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> flames," [...] Barbree reported. [...] "Vanguard's engine is lit and it's burning. But wait... wait a moment, there's... there's no liftoff! It appears to be crumbling in its own fire... It's burning on the pad... Vanguard has crumbled into flames. It failed ladies and gentlemen, Vanguard has failed." ...|$|E

HitFix's Alan Sepinwall titled his review [...] "The rules get upended in a terrific episode." [...] Both Elio Garcia from westeros.org and Jace Lacob from Televisionary considered it the best episode of the series so far. In the words of reviewer Jace Lacob, the episode [...] "revolves around changes both great and small, {{about the way the}} scales can fall from our eyes and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> truth that has been standing in front of us for so long. For Eddard, it's a realization of just why Jon Arryn died, of the terrible secret he had gleaned from the book of royal lineages, and just what this could mean for the throne...and for the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For Dany, it's the brutal truth of her brother's real nature, of his insatiable thirst for power and the twisted quality of his rampant heart." ...|$|E

[...] This open reciprocity is closed off precisely {{when it is}} balanced. Thought of in this way, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> relationship {{as a matter of}} degree, more or less open or closed. Closed reciprocity of gifts is most like market exchange. It is competitive, individualistic and may border on barter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Democratic Party, the other large {{governing}} coalition member, was similarly elusive, stating that: [...] "Now {{is not the right}} moment to talk about this issue [...] We now have other much more important things to do regarding European integration.

He puts it not in the center but slightly to the West and inclined to the north. This is altogether far from the truth, for China {{should be in the}} center of the world, which we can prove by the single fact that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> North Star resting at the zenith of the heaven at midnight. How can China be treated like a small unimportant country, and placed slightly to the north as in this map? ...|$|E

Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds a scrap of paper, representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run through the maze of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible.|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{also claims}} that an {{external}} environment {{is necessary for}} the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. [...] "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ngagpa (. {{feminine}} ngagma, [...] ) is {{an ordained}} Tantric practitioner, sometimes a householder with certain vows (dependent upon lama and lineage) {{that make them}} the householder equivalent of a monk or nun. The path of a ngakpa is a rigorous discipline whereby one [...] "enjoys the sense-fields' {{as a part of}} one's practice. A practitioner utilizes the whole of the phenomenal world as one's path. Marrying, raising children, working jobs, leisure, art, play etc. are all means to realize the enlightened state or rigpa, non-dual awareness. As such, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> prominence of householders in the Vajrayana tradition. [...] One can, however, be a householder without taking the vows of a ngagpa. Simply holding the five precepts, bodhisattva vows and the tantric vows while practising diligently can result in enlightenment.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} theme of the film, Kubrick stated that [...] "there's {{something}} inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dark side without having to confront it directly". Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could [...] "remember hating". However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have [...] "contributed something of value to the [...] genre" [...] and mentioned it as one of his [...] "personal favorites". Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.|$|E
