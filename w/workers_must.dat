5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E

Limits on the economic rights of women under the rule of law are present in several Muslim nations. In Saudi Arabia, for example, women are allowed to work but their formal employment cannot interfere with her duties as a homemaker. Saudi female <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> also travel with male companions, and they cannot work unless their husbands or guardians approve.|$|E
25|$|Table olive {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{investment}} by workers {{required to produce}} reproductives is considerable. Newly emerged males and queens are no more functional than pupae; both depend heavily on solid prey brought in by workers, thus competing with larvae for food resources. As a result, worker quantity must remain high {{in order to maintain}} reproductive output. <b>Workers</b> <b>must</b> maintain food stores and defend the nest, and colonies whose work force diminishes too early in the colony’s life cycle will suffer a greater overall total loss in reproductives.|$|E

25|$|The diet of P. sericea {{consists}} of arthropods such as caterpillars and flies, {{as well as}} energetic carbohydrates such as nectar and fruits. Larvae feed only on animal proteins that must be supplied by adult workers. The <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> hunt for insects and feed them to larvae by chewing up the prey and transferring it to the larvae. The most common natural prey of this species is green or brown caterpillars. They also may prey on cashew fruits {{which can be found}} in Brazil, as well as the white fly, which parasitizes the cashew fruit.|$|E
25|$|If the use {{of these}} methods is impossible, or if their use did not reduce the {{concentration}} of harmful substances to a safe value, <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> use respirators. These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, it is the least effective method of protection; and the reasons for the decrease of their efficiency often are: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and delayed replacement of gas cartridges.|$|E

One guiding principle for the project was that office space for at least 25,000 federal <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> be included. Another was that, although the buildings would be modern steel frame structures, they would each be the same height and faced with limestone. The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had the least influence over the overall design of the project, primarily because it had only recently been formed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>must</b> pay 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|Although disease-specific {{interventions}} are important, further {{strengthening of the}} public-health system will be needed if China is to halve the prevalence of tuberculosis {{and the number of}} deaths caused by the disease. To increase access, a package of essential public-health services for rural inhabitants and urban migrants should be provided with governmental subsidies. This package should include services for at least tuberculosis, immunisation, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal and child health. The government must also address the warped incentives in hospitals that encourage the generation of profits from drugs, tests, and state-of-the-art technologies. This profit generation fuels the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including tuberculosis. Finally, the government should provide operational costs for public-health services and full salaries for health-care workers, especially at and below the county level, where most of the rural population live. The number of staff needed for essential public-health functions should be carefully calculated, and public-health <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> be given fair pay. Without this, the development and maintenance of a motivated and skilled public-health workforce {{to meet the challenges of}} the 21st century will be difficult.|$|E

Doctors Without Borders criticized doctors at Salmaniya Hospital for joining the protests, but described the military response as [...] "exponentially more damaging" [...] to medical neutrality.

No faith other than Islam is permitted to be practised, although there are nearly a million Christians, nearly all foreign workers, in Saudi Arabia. There are no churches or other non-Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country. Even private prayer services are forbidden in practice and the Saudi religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians. Foreign <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> observe Ramadan and {{are not allowed to}} celebrate Christmas or Easter. Conversion by Muslims to another religion (apostasy) carries the death penalty, although there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is illegal, and the last Christian priest was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1985. Compensation in court cases discriminates against non-Muslims: once fault is determined, a Muslim receives all of the amount of compensation determined, a Jew or Christian half, and all others a sixteenth.|$|E

500|$|Filipino {{workers have}} protested Philippine {{government}} targeting of overseas Filipino workers, and a 1982 protest opposed Executive Order No. 857 (EO-857) implemented by Ferdinand Marcos. According to the order, overseas contract workers {{were required to}} remit 50 to 70 percent of their total earnings through authorised government channels only. Migrant-worker groups say that overseas Filipino <b>workers</b> <b>must</b> pay up to PHP150,000 ($3,400) in government and recruiting-agency fees before they can leave the country. In 2007, the Philippine government proposed a law requiring workers to submit to a [...] "competency training and assessment program" [...] which would cost them PHP10,000 to P15,000 (US$215 to US$320) – about half their average monthly salary (typically US$450). According to the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment, the policy would help protect domestic overseas workers from abuse by employers. Government agencies receive {{a total of about}} PHP21billion ($470million) a year from foreign workers in police clearances, National Bureau of Investigation and passport fees, membership in the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, local health insurance and Philippine Overseas Employment Agency and Home Development Mutual Fund fees. Although charges by Indonesian agencies for dormitory housing, lessons in Cantonese, housework and Chinese cuisine were capped at about HK$14,000 by the government in 2012, interest is excluded from the cap.
