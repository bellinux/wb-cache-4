Under Rose’s leadership, CUPE was particularly effective in improving pay and working conditions for women. He stepped down in 1991 after eight years, becoming deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs for the Ontario NDP government.|$|E

2500|$|Olof Palme's last government, elected {{during a}} time when Sweden's economy was in {{difficult}} shape, sought to pursue a [...] "third way," [...] designed to stimulate investment, production, and employment, having ruled out classical Keynesian policies {{as a result of the}} growing burden of foreign debt, together with the big balance of payments and budget deficits. This involved [...] "equality of sacrifice," [...] whereby <b>wage</b> <b>restraint</b> would be accompanied by increases in welfare provision and more progressive taxation. For instance, taxes on wealth, gifts, and inheritance were increased, while tax benefits to shareholders were either reduced or eliminated. In addition, various welfare cuts carried out before Olof's return to office were rescinded. The previous system of indexing pensions and other benefits was restored, the grant-in-aid scheme for municipal child care facilities was re-established, unemployment insurance was restored in full, and the so-called “no benefit days” for those drawing sickness benefits were cancelled. Increases were also made to both food subsidies and child allowances, while the employee investment funds (which represented a radical form of profit-sharing) were introduced.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of policy coordination {{in line with}} the New Open Economy Macroeconomics literature. I extent the analysis on non-cooperative toward cooperative solutions by incorporating a collective wage bargaining system and conservative central banks. It turns out that previous results on international monetary policy cooperation are modified such that cooperation is welfare improving. The finding in the model relies on wage setters’ perceptions about affecting monetary policy. It is shown that under cooperation wage setters perceive a tighter monetary policy, thereby inducing <b>wage</b> <b>restraints.</b> Monetary policy games, International policy coordination, Central bank conservatism, Monopoly unions...|$|R

50|$|The Ecuadorian economy {{recovered}} during 1984, {{partly as}} a result of temporary stability in the international price of crude oil and partly because of a rebound in the agricultural sector. By late 1984, the balance-of-payments current account, which had reflected a US$58 million deficit in 1983, had a US$19 million credit, and the trade surplus reached US$1 billion. The real GDP growth rate was 4 percent, nearly a 7-percent increase over 1983. These improvements in the economy, combined with <b>wage</b> <b>restraints</b> and a tight national government budget, made it possible to reduce the inflation rate in 1984 to 25 percent; for the next two years, the inflation rate was contained at about 24 percent.|$|R

She did not inform the regents that she was retiring. Instead, a day later she was rehired as the commissioner. This maneuver boosted her pay to $515,625.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{striking}} features of recent Soviet history has been the combination of emerging democracy and prolonged economic crisis. In E. Gaidar's formulation in the opening article of our current issue ("At the Beginning of a New Phase: An Economic Review"), {{it is as though}} history decided to conduct an experiment: Can democracy take root under conditions of a continuing economic crisis? This {{is only one of the}} interesting questions posed in Gaidar's review of Soviet economic policies and performance during the period 1985 - 90. The author focuses particular attention on the factors making for inflation and the obstacles to an effective anti-inflationary policy. In the course of warning Soviet readers about the potential dangers of the existing situationin particular, the dangers stemming from a "party of order" Gaidar notes that runaway inflation in Latin American countries has been repeatedly followed by military coups. This article also presents some useful empirical material bearing on Soviet inflationary pressures (changes in money incomes of the population, rates of capital investment, the budget deficit as a percentage of GNP). Of special interest is Gaidar's elaboration of the argument that effective anti-inflationary measures, while obviously necessary from an economic standpoint, became "politically impossible. " In what sense? Only a political leadership that had very substantial popular supportcertainly more than that possessed by the Gorbachev leadership at the beginning of the ninetiescould have imposed the kind of <b>wage</b> <b>restraints,</b> limits on social programs, reductions in subsidies, etc., required to control and reverse the acceleration of inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} the recent {{performance}} of the Dutch economy (1982 – 2001) have attracted wide international attention: (1) rapid employment growth and (2) a significant slowdown in labour productivity growth. This paper argues that the shift from a high-productivity, low-employment towards a low-productivity, high-employment growth path constitutes a structural change set off by the policy of low wage growth launched in 1982. Various theoretical perspectives—including neo-classical substitution, induced technological change, vintage and the Verdoorn Law—point to channels through which <b>wage</b> growth <b>restraint</b> may hold back labour productivity growth. Our growth accounting analysis—based on these perspectives—suggests that {{a substantial part of}} the Dutch labour productivity growth slowdown {{can be attributed to the}} wage growth slowdown...|$|R
40|$|In {{a memorable}} {{speech to the}} United Nations General Assembly, Nikita Krushehev {{predicted}} that communism would bury capitalism. In less emotive and more economistic terms, he was saying in effect that centrally planned economies would outperform market economies {{in terms of both}} output growth and social justice. History has not been kind to Krushehev. Not only central planning but even milder forms of state interventionism now stand discredited, and developing countries round the world are desperately trying to install functioning market economics. This sea-change in development philosophy generally owes something to donor conditionalities associated with structural adjustment credits, to the extent that “reforms” and “structural adjustment” have become virtually synonymous. Shortterm internal or external balance crises, and longer-term stagnation, also signalled to policy-makers the bankruptcy of over-interventionist policies—a lesson driven home by the phenomenal growth performance of the NIC’s, apparently the fruit of marketfriendly policies. In general, reform measures can be classified into three types: expenditurereducing, i. e., monetary, fiscal and <b>wage</b> <b>restraints,</b> expenditure—switching or supply-side measures intended to shift resources from non-tradable to tradables, e. g. real devaluation, tariff and subsidy reduction (aimed at bringing domestic prices in line with world prices for tradables), and institutional and policy reforms primarily armed at providing the private sector with a congenial environment. The policy package appropriate for a century will depend on initial conditions, e. g. demand-side policies will be most effective in a country where desired absorption exceeds full employment output capacity. And a country whose social and cultural backgrounds are conducive to rapid response to expenditure switching will have less need for expenditure reduction with its inevitable contractionary consequences. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{presents}} and analyses various attempts {{made by the}} factors {{in the international community}} to define the rules of behavior in waging war as a means of communication among states in resolving their mutual problems. Presenting first the history (several centuries long) of attempts to restrain war waging the author focuses on the endeavors of the League of Nations in the period between the two world wars {{as well as on the}} creation of regulations by the United Nations after World War II. The author points out that the United Nations has built a comprehensive system of <b>waging</b> war <b>restraint</b> that, among other things, not only prohibits aggressive war waging, but also any use of armed force or threat of use of force. Some forms of military interventions could be taken only within the UN corresponding procedure. In spite of the fact that the treatment of war is regulated by the law within UN, it is present in the contemporary world as a result of the existing political and economic relations. As the author concludes, war and force keep on being used in practice, sometimes in a very violent way. Thus, they violate the provisions of international law that regulates the rules and treatment of war in international relations. ...|$|R
