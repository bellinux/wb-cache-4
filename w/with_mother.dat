Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E

In C. aperea, interactions <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> and unfamiliar females were largely similar; in G. monasteriensis, interactions <b>with</b> the <b>mother,</b> but not unfamiliar female, were characterized by physical closeness and sociopositive behavior.

5|$|St. Rynagh's National School (NS) caters for {{children}} between the ages of 4 and 12 and accommodates approximately 200 students. Secondary education is provided by Banagher College (Coláiste na Sionna), a multi denominational school under the responsibility of Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board. Banagher College is an amalgamation of La Sainte Union Secondary School and St. Rynagh's Community College. La Sainte Union is a voluntary Catholic School run by the Sisters of La Sainte-Union des Sacrés-Coeurs, a congregation founded in France in 1826 by Abbé Jean-Baptiste Debrabant to promote Christian education. The school was their first in Ireland and opened its doors in 1863 in a house on Main Street when the Abbé arrived <b>with</b> <b>Mother</b> Anatolie Badger and three sisters of the order.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new cinematics {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately {{in a way that the}} player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory more than in the original Metroid. Cinematics are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward and to keep the plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level at the start of the game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle <b>with</b> <b>Mother</b> Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish <b>with</b> <b>Mother</b> Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{association}} between perinatal losses and mother’s long-term mortality and modification by surviving children and attained education. Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: Norwegian national registries. Participants: We followed 652 320 <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> a first delivery from 1967 and completed reproduction before 2003, until 2010 or death. We excluded <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> plural pregnancies, without information on education (0. 3 %) and women born outside Norway. Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were age-specific (40 – 69 years) cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. We calculated mortality in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> perinatal losses, compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> without, and in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one loss by number of surviving children in strata of mothers’ attained education (< 11 years (low), ≥ 11 years (high)). Results: <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> perinatal losses had increased crude mortality compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> without; total: HR 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 1. 4), cardiovascular: HR 1. 8 (1. 5 to 2. 1), non-cardiovascular: HR 1. 3 (1. 2 to 1. 4). Childless <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one perinatal loss had increased mortality compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one child and no loss; cardiovascular: low education HR 2. 7 (1. 7 to 4. 3), high education HR 0. 91 (0. 13 to 6. 5); non-cardiovascular: low education HR 1. 6 (1. 3 to 2. 2), high education HR 1. 8 (1. 1 to 2. 9). <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> one perinatal loss, surviving children and high education had no increased mortality, whereas corresponding <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> low education had increased mortality; cardiovascular: two surviving children HR 1. 7 (1. 2 to 2. 4), three or more surviving children HR 1. 6 (1. 1 to 2. 4); non-cardiovascular: one surviving child HR 1. 2 (1. 0 to 1. 5), two surviving children HR 1. 2 (1. 1 to 1. 4). Conclusions: Irrespective of education, we find excess mortality in childless <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> a perinatal loss.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the nature and extent}} of differences in young children's talk when they interact <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> and peers. Sixteen girls between 2. 5 and 3. 5 years of age played twice with their moners and twice with a peer. Play sessions were videotaped and coded according to measures of quantity and quality of talk. Results of measures of quantity indicated that children used a greater number of word tokens and a greater variety of word types when talking <b>with</b> the <b>mother</b> than when talking with the peer. The ratio between tokens and types was the same with each partner. The number of utterances and the number of turns taken in the conversation were greater <b>with</b> the <b>mother</b> than <b>with</b> the peer, while the number of utterances per turn favored the peer over the mother. Results of measures of quality indicated that children's mean length of utterance was higher with peers than <b>with</b> <b>mothers.</b> The use of subordinating conjunctions was identical with each partner. Children's use of imperatives was more frequent with peers, and their use of questions more frequent <b>with</b> <b>mothers.</b> ChildreL were equally likely to use turnabouts, or conversational linkages that are both contingent ant; projective, <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> and peers.
