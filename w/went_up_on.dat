Sales <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Amazon Japan by 450%, bringing the game to second place in their best-seller charts behind Tales of Berseria. In its first week of release, Persona 5 topped Japanese game sales charts. The PS4 version reached #1 with sales of 264,793 units, while the PS3 version reached #2 with 72,974. This resulted in a combined sales total of 337,767 units. This made Persona 5 the fastest-selling title in the series' history, surpassing Revelations: Persona, and together with Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 pushed sales of the PS4 up significantly over the previous week. The following week, the PS4 version fell to #2 with further sales of 45,178 units, while the PS3 version fell to #6 with 14,771 units.

2500|$|Nike has vigorously {{defended the}} Air Force 1 in U.S. courts.

The issue that <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> appeal was whether Nike's tactics had thereby rendered the entire dispute moot (meaning {{there was no longer}} an active case or controversy), so that the U.S. federal courts had been deprived of jurisdiction to hear the defendant's counterclaim.

2500|$|On 12 March, protesters {{appeared}} {{in the streets of}} Lhasa declaring Tibet's independence. Barricades <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Lhasa, and Chinese and Tibetan rebel forces began to fortify positions within and around Lhasa in preparation for conflict. A petition of support for the armed rebels outside the city was taken up, and an appeal for assistance was made to the Indian consul. Chinese and Tibetan troops continued moving into position over the next several days, with Chinese artillery pieces being deployed within range of the Dalai Lama's summer palace, the Norbulingka. On 15 March, preparations for the Dalai Lama's evacuation from the city were set in motion, with Tibetan troops being employed to secure an escape route from Lhasa. On 17 March, two artillery shells landed near the Dalai Lama's palace, triggering his flight into exile. On 19 March the Chinese started to shell the Norbulingka, prompting the full force of the Uprising. Combat lasted only about two days, with Tibetan rebel forces being badly outnumbered and poorly armed. Two British writers, Stuart and Roma Gelder, visited the Chensel Phodrang palace in the Norbulingka in 1962 and [...] "found its contents meticulously preserved". They did not claim that the Norbulingka had not been damaged.|$|E
2500|$|The {{details of}} the cases vary widely: In the 1444 Frankfurt cases and the 1499 Hanau case, the dogs were dead prior to be hanged, and in the late 1615 and 1661 cases in Frankfurt, the Jews (and dogs) were merely kept in this torture for half an hour, before being garroted from below. In the 1588 Bergen case, all three victims were left hanging till they were dead, ranging from 6 to 8 days after being hanged. In the Dortmund 1486 case, the dogs bit the Jew to death while hanging. In the 1611 Öttingen case, the Jew [...] "Jacob the Tall" [...] thought {{to blow up the}} [...] "Deutsche Ordenhaus" [...] with {{gunpowder}} after having burgled it. He was strung up between two dogs, and a large fire was made close to him, and he expired after half an hour under this torture. In the 1553 Württemberg case, the Jew chose to convert to Christianity after hanging like this for 24 hours; he was then given the mercy to be hanged in the ordinary manner, from the neck, and without the dogs beside him. In the 1462 Halle case, the Jew Abraham also converted after 24 hours hanging upside down, and a priest <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a ladder and baptised him. For two more days, Abraham was left hanging, while the priest argued with the city council that a true Christian should not be punished in this way. On the third day, Abraham was granted a reprieve, and was taken down, but died 20 days later in the local hospital having meanwhile suffered in extreme pain. In the 1637 case, where the Jew had murdered a Christian jeweller, the appeal to the empress was successful, and out of mercy, the Jew was condemned to be merely pinched with glowing pincers, have hot lead dripped into his wounds, and then be broken alive on the wheel.|$|E
