500|$|Rescued by Rover was {{predominantly}} {{a family}} affair â€“ Cecil Hepworth's wife, Margaret, wrote the scenario and {{played the role of}} the mother on screen. Hepworth himself directed, painted the scenery and acted as the father. Their child <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> on screen, and the part of Rover was played by the family dog, Blair. Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife as the old woman who stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall [...] "We couldn't get them for less". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors. Completing the cast was Mabel Clark, who had previously played Alice in Hepworth's version of Alice in Wonderland, as the child's nurse. Clark was also the cutting room assistant.|$|E

2500|$|Subdivided {{groups are}} present when peak boom years or {{inverted}} peak bust years are present, {{and may be}} represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as [...] "pre-peak" [...] (including peak year) and [...] "post-peak". The year 1957 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "bust", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.|$|E

His little grandchild seemed to renew his own happy days, and he delighted to take her from her mother and fondle her. No sooner <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in his arms than Flora's hands were busy among the papers, and she begged him to ring for lights.|$|E
6000|$|It is easy {{to guess}} how, as the story came out, the king looked blacker and blacker, {{and more and more}} grim, until at last he was half fainting with rage and astonishment.

He wished he had {{sufficient}} excuse to put the boy to death, for the old hermit's prophecy came back to him as strongly as ever; and yet the young man had done nothing bad enough to deserve such a punishment. Everyone would call him a tyrant if he were to give such an order--in fact, he dared not try it! ...|$|E

Its superlative daintiness struck his fancy. A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> at the end, and that fat woman. No Gyp! Never in when she was wanted. Wagge! He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a brandy-bottle from a locked {{cupboard}} and drank some. It steadied him; he locked up the cupboard again, and dressed.|$|E

60|$|This {{family was}} not only Thorogood but thorough-going. The father was a blacksmith, with five sons and one daughter, {{and he used to}} hammer truth into his children's heads with as much vigour as he was wont to hammer the tough iron on his anvil; but he did it kindly. He was not a growly-wowly, cross-grained man, like some fathers we know of--not he. His broad, hairy face was like a sun, and his eyes darted sunbeams {{wherever}} they turned. The faces of his five sons were just like his own, except in regard to roughness and hair. Tom, and Dick, and Harry, and Bob, and Jim, were their names. Jim <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Their ages were equally separated. If you began with Jim, who was three, you had only to say--four, five, six, seven--Tom being seven.|$|E
60|$|Maggot's {{family had}} {{followed}} him to Penberth. Mrs M was there, busy as a bee--so was Zackey, so was little Grace, and so <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> They all worked like Trojans, {{the only difference between}} baby Maggot and the others being, that, while they did as much work as in them lay, he undid as much as possible; was in every one's way; fell over and into everything, including the sea, and, generally, fulfilled his mission of mischief-maker with credit. The chet was there too! Baby Maggot had decreed that it should accompany him, so there it was, living on pilchards, and dragging out its harassed existence in the usual way. What between salt food, and play, kicks, cuffs, capers, and gluttony, its aspect at that time was more demoniacal, perhaps, than that of any other chet between John o' Groat's and the Land's End.|$|E
60|$|Macbeth and Sancho {{have been}} equally eloquent in the praise of sleep. 'Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care!' But sleep will knit up effectually no broken {{stitches}} unless it be enjoyed in bed. 'Blessings on him who invented sleep,' said Sancho. But the great inventor {{was he who}} discovered mattresses and sheets and blankets. These two unfortunates no doubt slept; but in the morning they were weary, comfortless, and exhausted. Towels and basins were brought to them, and then they prepared themselves to watch through another day. It {{seemed to be a}} trial between them, which could outwatch the other. The mother was, of course, much the older; but with poor Hester there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to add to her troubles. Never was there a woman more determined to carry out her purpose than Mrs. Bolton, or one more determined to thwart the purpose of another than she who still called herself Hester Caldigate. In the morning Mrs. Bolton implored her husband to go into Cambridge as usual; but he felt that he could not leave the house with such inmates. So he sat in his bedroom dozing wretchedly in his arm-chair.|$|E
