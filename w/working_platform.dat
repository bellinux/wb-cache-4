25|$|In recent years, {{medical records}} have changed considerably. Although many {{physicians}} and hospitals still maintain paper records, {{there is a}} drive for electronic records. Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} <b>working</b> <b>platform.</b> Technology has gotten so sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.|$|E
25|$|Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations {{after her}} recommissioning with her home port at Seattle, Washington, Miller Freemans primary {{mission was to}} provide a <b>working</b> <b>platform</b> {{for the study of the}} ocean's living resources, {{operating}} primarily in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. After returning to service, she spent much of the remainder of 1975 conducting work in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea in support of the NOAA Offshore Continental Shelf Survey and Assessment Program, primarily carrying out resource surveys for the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment, and Prediction Program (MARMAP). Her research activities were interrupted on 22 October 1975, when the United States Coast Guard asked her to assist the crabbing vessel Aquarian, which had lost her steering while operating in the Aleutian Islands. Despite the rough seas in 40- to 60-knot (74- to 111-km/hr) winds, Miller Freemans crew managed to get a line across to Aquarian and tow her to Akutan Island, ending a two-day ordeal for Aquarians crew.|$|E
500|$|On November 12, 2014, the {{supporting}} wire rope cables of a suspended <b>working</b> <b>platform</b> slacked. The cables were manufactured by Tractel, {{and they were}} used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building's exterior. At the time, the platform was holding a two-man, SEIU-affiliated window washing team. The slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower. The workers were rescued by over 100 FDNY firefighters, who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass. After the incident, the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia, and were taken to the hospital.|$|E

500|$|New oak joists {{were laid}} on the dust floor and {{temporary}} boarding laid to provide a <b>working</b> <b>platform</b> for repairs {{to the top of}} the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. [...] The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.|$|E

Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including water dredge and air lifts create additional hazards and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites {{may be subject to}} strong tidal flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{hydraulic}} ram design, Leader Williams appointed Edwin Clark as principal designer.

Above ground the superstructure consisted of seven hollow cast iron columns which provided guide rails for the caissons and supported an upper <b>working</b> <b>platform,</b> walkways and access staircase. At the upper level the boat lift was connected to the Trent and Mersey canal via a [...] long wrought iron aqueduct, with vertical wrought iron gates at either end.|$|E
