25|$|I regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to do. Placed {{before the}} same {{circumstances}} today, I would do {{exactly the same}} thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.|$|E
25|$|If I were {{to drink}} a quart of blood and, concealing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done, come to the {{emergency}} room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.|$|E
25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, I probably would have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop later that I realised <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first up in my Test career reinforced <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|It became {{apparent}} that his comments condemning Holocaust denial had been printed in a neo-Nazi magazine, and {{that most of the}} anonymous calls and letters were [...] "From people who tried to prove that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen with my own eyes, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> experienced in Auschwitz was a big, big mistake, a big hallucination on my part because it hadn't happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Drawing {{from the}} 1933 World Jamboree, Bánáthy based the program symbol and its spirit {{on the white}} stag from Hungarian mythology. On June 8, 1959, the adults adopted this. [...] "Lord Baden-Powell was my {{personal}} idol and I long felt a commitment {{to give back to}} Scouting <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received," [...] Bánáthy [...] said.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast members}} {{reportedly}} got together in Los Angeles {{to watch the}} finale. It was well received by the main cast, who were confident that the fans {{would have the same}} reaction. David Schwimmer said, [...] "It's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters." ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{thought about}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been offered and I said to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{arrived at}} my Broadway studio in New York {{with a small}} bag of clothes and jewelery, and no entourage. Then, {{in front of the}} camera she was explosive, like a great model, but with her own unique style. She came over the next day to see some prints and the proofs, and there was shot after shot to choose from. We agreed on every choice and whittled it down to the album cover images. I had no idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just been a party to." ...|$|E
500|$|For New Amerykah Part One, Badu collaborated principally with Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, Karriem Riggins, James Poyser, audio {{engineer}} Mike [...] "Chav" [...] Chavarria, and {{the members}} of musical group Sa-Ra, who made production and lyrical contributions to most of the tracks. She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.' And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> in mind for this project".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should <b>I</b> spare <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> already conquered, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{sworn to}} destroy?" [...] he asked. [...] "When I offered you mercy {{you would have}} none of it. Why do you ask it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered," [...] he said; [...] "if you <b>had</b> gone through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{compelled}} to endure--" [...] His voice failed him; his soft brown eyes moistened; his head drooped. He said no more.|$|R

500|$|Morse {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles following the finale of St. Elsewhere in 1988. He is quoted as saying: [...] "I made the decision that I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. I had to find roles that were different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been doing." [...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse. He later starred in The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard. He has {{appeared in}} three adaptations of Stephen King stories: The Langoliers, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Green Mile. He was a guest star on , playing the racist cousin of Detective Tim Bayliss.|$|E
500|$|On 2 April, as Bounty {{approached}} Cape Horn, {{a strong}} gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which, Bligh wrote, [...] "exceeded <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever met with before... with severe squalls of hail and sleet". The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, she was further north {{than she had}} been a week earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, and that they would turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope—"to the great joy of every person on Board", Bligh recorded.|$|E
500|$|Eno enlisted sixteen guest {{musicians to}} play on the album with him, {{including}} John Wetton and Robert Fripp of King Crimson, Simon King from Hawkwind, Bill MacCormick of Matching Mole, Paul Rudolph of Pink Fairies, Chris Spedding and all the members of Roxy Music except vocalist Bryan Ferry. Eno selected them on the basis that he thought they were incompatible with each other musically. He stated that he [...] "got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> intended".|$|E

500|$|In 1953, Levin {{applied for}} a job on the weekly {{periodical}} Truth. The paper had recently {{been taken over by}} the liberal publisher Ronald Staples who together with his new editor Vincent Evans was determined to cleanse it of its previous right-wing racist reputation. Levin's noticeably Jewish surname, together with such skills as he had acquired in shorthand and typing, gained him immediate acceptance. He was offered the post of [...] "general editorial dogsbody, which was exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been looking for". After a year, Evans left and was succeeded by his deputy, George Scott; Levin was promoted in Scott's place. He wrote for the paper under a variety of pseudonyms, including [...] "A.E.Cherryman".|$|E
500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I looked at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ave Maria" [...] {{is present}} on the I Am... disc of the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce, {{as it is a}} ballad that shows Knowles' insecurities about love, and the person she is [...] "{{underneath}} all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to say." [...] During an interview, Knowles revealed that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] was the most personal song to her on the whole album.|$|E
