2500|$|Article 291 of the 1976 Constitution {{defined the}} districts as a {{transitional}} level of administration, awaiting {{the formation of}} the administrative regions. In the period between 1991 and 2013 the <b>whole</b> <b>continental</b> <b>territory</b> of Portugal was subdivided into metropolitan areas and intermunicipal communities, which rendered the districts obsolete. As a consequence of these constitutional revisions the [...] "district" [...] has been removed from the legal framework, but remains an important and relevant division for other entities. Similarly, it is still recognized by the general public.|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of food transportation depends on the trade-off between (increased) distances and the efficiency of modern logistics procedures. The relevant literature points out that such a trade-off is place and product specific, thus supporting the broadening of “food miles” research to new territories and product categories. Here we analyze the {{environmental impact}} – in terms of global warming, local pollution and traffic congestion – of two different canned tomatoes brands produced in Italy and consumed in Sassari (Sardinia, Italy). The supply chain of the first brand extends over the <b>whole</b> <b>continental</b> Italian <b>territory,</b> while the second one is mainly located in Sardinia. Different distribution patterns (modern vs. independent retail) and shopping modalities (foot vs. car) are also considered. The case study shows that the national supply chain contributes to global warming {{much more than the}} regional one, and therefore supports the view that shorter supply chains can be more sustainable than efficient logistics. The case study also confirms the very high impact of shopping by car, both in terms of global warming and local pollution. food miles, transportation, logistics, environmental impact, italy, canned tomatoes...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of food transportation is site and product specific and depends on the direct relation between origin-to-destination distance and logistic efficiency, as pointed out by the relevant literature. This paper analyses a very specific case, comparing the impacts of transportation generated by the logistics of two brands of Italian canned tomato purchased in Sassari (Sardinia, Italy), one extending over the <b>whole</b> <b>continental</b> Italian <b>territory,</b> the other mainly located in the island of Sardinia. Different sale (supermarket chain vs. independent retailers) and shopping (foot vs. car) modalities are also considered. The contributions to global warming, local pollution and traffic congestion are considered. The case study shows that the logistics of the national brand is much more polluting than the regional, {{not only because of}} the longer distance between origin and destination, but also because the additional distance that is needed to reach logistic hubs is not compensated by higher load factors. Instead, the logistics of the regional brand is based on a very efficient point-to-point organization. This result is generalizable to all regional supply chains featuring high volumes of product. Results of the case study also depend on: a) the high impact of packaging transportation, because of the very low weight/volume ratio of empty cans; b) the high CO 2 emission coefficient of lorries and trailers transportation by ferry (Ro–Ro). The case study also stresses the very high impact of shopping by car. </br...|$|R
40|$|Landscapes can be {{described}} by seasonal and spatial patterns linked to vegetation type and phenology, environmental conditions, and human activities. The objective of this work is to propose and test an approach for delineating homogeneous landscape units at a regional scale by using only Earth observation data. We used MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) images from 2007 to 2011, acquired over the <b>whole</b> <b>continental</b> French <b>territory</b> at 250 m spatial resolution. The data set includes time series of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and time series of five Haralick texture indices. A principal components analysis (PCA) allowed us to choose the most representative indices (spectral and textural) and dates {{to be used in}} the region-growing segmentation. Different combinations of input data, as well as different segmentation parameters, were tested and compared using unsupervised evaluation methods. These methods were used to analyze the radiometric homogeneity of the regions and the radiometric disparity between regions when changing the homogeneity criterion of the segmentation. The best segmentation results obtained included three EVI images, together with three images of the texture 2 nd moment, corresponding to the average of the months of April, July and December from 2007 to 2011. The optimum homogeneity criterion for the region-growing segmentation using this combination of variables was 15. We believe this method is applicable at other scales and other data sets for vegetation and biodiversity studies, and for habitat mapping. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
