5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask <b>what</b> <b>a</b> burnt finger feels like, or <b>what</b> <b>a</b> blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask <b>what</b> <b>a</b> surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E

5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} <b>what</b> <b>a</b> man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.
