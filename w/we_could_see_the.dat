25|$|Dennett's {{thesis is}} that our modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E
2500|$|He began {{thinking}} about the garden long before he started work on it, evidenced by his description of a visit to Fontaine-de-Vaucluse in 1740. The fragment documenting this contains only {{a description of the}} scenic valley, but the village was home to Petrarch, who famously described his two gardens there: one created by the river and its cliffs, for admiration and inspiration, but inaccessible; the other near his house beside the river, where ... art surmounts nature ... and where he ... gathered the labourers, the fishermen and the shepherds; we rolled giant stones, built up a fortification against the Nymphs (that is, the river in spate), we carved out an altar for the Muses; soon <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Helicon, Parnassus, the Hippocrene; and we planted the forest of the poets.|$|E
2500|$|Days, weeks, months, {{and even}} years might have passed on {{much in the}} same manner.... We breakfasted at the same hour, and the tea-kettle was always boiling...; a lounge in the orchard {{for an hour or}} two, and twice a week <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> steam-boat {{creeping}} like a spider over the surface of the lake; a volume of the Scotch novels..., or M. Galignani's Paris and London Observer, amused us till dinner time; then tea and a walk till the moon unveiled itself, [...] "apparent queen of the night," [...] or the brook, swoln with a transient shower, was heard more distinctly in the darkness, mingling with the soft, rustling breeze; and the next morning the song of peasants broke upon refreshing sleep, as the sun glanced among the clustering vine-leaves, or the shadowy hills, as the mists retired from their summits, looked in at our windows.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the West Indies won {{the match}} and {{levelled}} the series. In the decider in Jamaica, Waugh took 2/14 in the West Indies' first innings of 265 and then {{arrived at the}} crease with Australia at 73 for three in reply. [...] He compiled a long partnership of 231 runs with his brother Mark, who was eventually out for 126. [...] Waugh was the last man to go, out for 200 after nine hours of batting. [...] "Steve had {{made up his mind}} to bat and bat", wrote Paul Reiffel, [...] "to stay out there and anchor the proceedings. [...] e copped a lot of blows on his arms, chest and ribs. When he came back to the dressing room at the end of day two, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> spots and bruises on his body [...] I remember when I walked in [...] he didn't say anything to me, but then he didn't need to. We all pretty much knew that we just had to support him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I could tell it was a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{voice was}} now heard hailing {{us from the}} entrance. From the window <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> figure {{of a man in}} the moonlight; he stood motionless, his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of {{something}} white on his extended arm; and as we looked right down upon him, though he was a good many yards distant on the links, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> moonlight glitter on his eyes.|$|E

60|$|The {{room was}} getting darker and darker. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{crouching}} figure of Miserrimus Dexter at the expiring fire--and that was all.|$|R
60|$|He {{was waiting}} on the {{platform}} when we stepped out, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in <b>the</b> light of the station lamps {{that he was very}} pale, and quivering with agitation.|$|R

60|$|We couldn't {{keep from}} talking about them, and they {{was all the}} time {{coming up in our}} memory, and looking just the way they looked when we was all alive and happy together. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> line marching, and the shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dromedaries lumbering along; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> wedding and the funeral; and more oftener than {{anything}} else we could see them praying, because they don't allow nothing to prevent that; whenever the call come, several times a day, they would stop right there, and stand up and face to the east, and lift back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin, and four or five times they would go down on their knees, and then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground.|$|E

60|$|As {{the signal}} light flickered over them, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from <b>the</b> shore that these {{immutable}} strangers wore red fezes, {{and that their}} faces were of a swarthy, large-featured type, which proclaimed an Eastern origin.|$|R
60|$|Peering {{out from}} amid <b>the</b> thicket <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> {{inhabitants}} of the settlement had gone to their rest. Two hours after the sunset, the garrison was quiet, and yet our commander gave no signal.|$|R

60|$|The Land's End {{was visible}} {{at a great}} distance; and as we neared <b>the</b> Lizard, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> not only <b>the</b> lighthouses on the Cliff, and every {{well-known}} cove and rock from Mullion and Kynance round to St. Keverne, but far inland likewise.

60|$|The {{thing was}} exasperating--it was absurd. Here {{we were just}} arrived upon the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>the</b> gray and {{streaming}} wall of the bubble in which we had come.|$|R
