2500|$|Boileau was {{the fifteenth}} child of Gilles Boileau, {{a clerk in}} the parlement. Two of his {{brothers}} attained some distinction: Gilles Boileau, {{the author of a}} translation of Epictetus; and Jacques Boileau, who became a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, and made valuable contributions to church history. The surname [...] "Despréaux" [...] was derived from a small property at Crosne near Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. His mother died when he was two years old; and Nicolas Boileau, who had a delicate constitution, seems to have suffered something from <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

60|$|The same <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> operates, {{in another}} way, by {{lowering}} the standard of health, increasing the susceptibility to nervous or sentimental impressions, and thus adding to the other powers of nature over us whatever charm may be felt in her fostering the melancholy fancies of brooding idleness.|$|E

"Everyone is responsible, {{not only}} for the result of his willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his <b>want</b> <b>of</b> {{ordinary}} <b>care</b> or skill in the management of his property or person, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by <b>want</b> <b>of</b> ordinary <b>care,</b> brought the injury upon himself.

60|$|A little Neglect may breed great Mischief: adding, {{for want}} of a Nail the Shoe was lost; {{for want of}} a Shoe the Horse was lost; and {{for want of a}} Horse the Rider was lost, being {{overtaken}} and slain by the Enemy; all for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>Care</b> about a Horse-shoe Nail.|$|E
60|$|The youth had not {{proceeded}} far {{before he}} came upon signs which showed that the cave at one time had been inhabited by human beings. First he espied a part of an old bag, then a weather-beaten sailor's cap, and soon after a rusty pistol, falling apart for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

"I don't know," [...] said Cecil, hesitating; [...] "may be all this-—your getting right, I mean, is {{the coming}} round of prayers—-my mother's, I mean, for {{if you take}} this turn, {{it will be much}} easier for me! Poor mother! it's not for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> her <b>caring</b> and teaching." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{ambulance}} service would not owe a duty <b>of</b> <b>care</b> under negligence {{for refusing to}} respond to a 999 call (though they may be in breach of statutory duty). Also, the burden upon the claimant of showing a causative <b>want</b> <b>of</b> proper <b>care</b> (considering the particular conditions of an emergency) would ordinarily provide {{ambulance service}}s with what he called the ‘necessary protection’ against liability, except where their conduct was manifestly deficient.|$|R

60|$|And at {{the first}} {{possible}} moment, Mervyn, Maria, and the Maltese were off through the open window. Robert asked what Phoebe thought of Mervyn. She said he was much stronger, but the doctor was not satisfied that the mischief was removed, and feared that a little <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> or any excitement might bring on another attack. She dreaded the morrow on his account.|$|E
60|$|He was too bitterly disappointed, on his side, {{to attempt}} to prolong the interview. A deadly sense of {{weakness}} was beginning to overpower him. It was the inevitable result of his utter <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for himself. After a sleepless night, {{he had taken a}} long walk before breakfast; and to these demands on his failing reserves of strength, he had now added the fatigue of dawdling about a garden. Physically and mentally he had no energy left.|$|E

"To {{call your}} guard and order my {{immediate}} arrest," [...] broke in milor with a whimsical smile, [...] "but {{in that case}} a citizen of France will die for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> a doctor's <b>care.</b> Let me {{take you to the}} child's bedside, citizen doctor, you can always have me arrested afterwards." ...|$|R
2500|$|Where {{allegedly}} seditious publications are concerned, section 6(2) of the Sedition Act {{provides that}} [...] "o person shall be convicted of any offence {{referred to in}} section 4(1)(c) or (d) if such person proves that the publication in respect {{of which he is}} charged was printed, published, sold, offered for sale, distributed, reproduced or imported (as the case may be) without his authority, consent and knowledge and without any <b>want</b> <b>of</b> due <b>care</b> or caution on his part or {{that he did not know}} and had no reason to believe that the publication had a seditious tendency." ...|$|R
60|$|Surely {{after such}} {{evidence}} {{from such a}} source {{there must be some}} heart-searchings among those higher members of the Catholic hierarchy, including both Cardinals and Bishops, who have done what they could to cripple the efforts of the reformers. Misinformed through their own <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in searching for the truth, they have stood before the whole world as the defenders of that which will be described by the historian as the greatest crime in history.|$|E
60|$|But Violet was firm, whereupon {{the cook}} harassed her with contrarieties; and late hours and London air {{had so far}} told upon her {{that she could not}} shake off her cares cheerfully. She knew all would turn out ill--tormented herself--brought on a headache, and looked unwell when the evening came. The cook sent up the dinner with just enough <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> to keep her in such continual {{apprehension}} that she could hardly attend to the conversation.|$|E
60|$|His journey {{cost him}} dear, for {{as he was}} riding home he was {{attacked}} with violent pain {{in the face and}} shiverings, which forced him to halt at the first shelter he could find, happily with kind friends, who nursed him for a fortnight before he could return home. He believed that had his illness seized him in his log house at home, he must certainly have died for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and attendance, although he was much beloved by his poor Indians.|$|E
6000|$|These {{are some}} of the capital fallacies of the author. To break the thread of my {{discourse}} as little as possible, I have thrown into the margin many instances, though God knows far from the whole of his inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and <b>want</b> <b>of</b> common <b>care.</b> I think myself obliged to take some notice of them, in order to take off from any authority this writer may have; and {{to put an end to}} the deference which careless men are apt to pay to one who boldly arrays his accounts, and marshals his figures, in perfect confidence that their correctness will never be examined.[58] ...|$|R

60|$|When {{we reached}} the hay-barn we were met {{by the rest of}} the Larramie family, all anxious to see the bear. Even Miss Edith, who had had one glimpse of the beast, was very glad indeed to assure me that she did not wonder in the least that I had {{supposed}} there would be no harm in leaving such a mild creature for a little while by the side of the road, and I was sure from the exclamations of the rest of the family that Orso would not suffer for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and attention during his stay in the hay-barn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Protected {{by their}} {{peculiar}} isolation {{during the late}} war, there was no necessity for any real fortification of the place. Nevertheless, it affords some occupation and position for our kind friend, Don Miguel, and so serves a beneficial purpose. This little gun," [...] he continued, stopping to attentively examine a small but beautifully carved bronze six-pounder, which showed indications of better care than the others, [...] "seems to be the saluting-gun Don Miguel spoke of. For {{the last fifty years}} it has spoken only the language of politeness and courtesy, and yet through <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> the tampion, as you see, has become swollen and choked in its mouth." ...|$|E

"O Lionel, dear Lionel," [...] and she {{sprang to}} him, {{to lead him}} back to his seat, but he still {{retained}} his hold of the lock and would not move; [...] "you know"--her tears were flowing--"you know how I grieve for you; but if you are in trouble, that ought not to make you do wrong," [...] He was turning the lock, and hardened his face, but Marian went on, [...] "Don't go, Lionel, only hear me.

60|$|But to say truth, {{although}} it has been my business to attend closely to the controversies roused by the publication of Mr. Darwin's book, I think that not one of the enormous mass of objections and obstacles which have been raised is of any very great value, except that sterility case which I brought before you just now. All the rest are misunderstandings of some sort, arising either from prejudice, or <b>want</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, or still more from <b>want</b> <b>of</b> patience and <b>care</b> in reading the work.|$|R
6000|$|The chief, {{and almost}} the only, {{cause of the}} {{deepness}} and foulness of the roads is occasioned by the standing water, which (for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> due <b>care</b> to draw it off by scouring and opening ditches and drains, and other watercourses, and clearing of passages) soaks into the earth, and softens it {{to such a degree}} that it cannot bear the weight of horses and carriages; to prevent which, the power to dig, trench, and cut down, &c., mentioned above will be of absolute necessity.

60|$|Wingrave turned {{slightly}} in his chair. In his altered position, {{a ray of}} sunshine fell {{for the first time}} upon his gaunt but striking face. Lined and hardened, as though by exposure and <b>want</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>care,</b> there was also a lack of sensibility, an almost animal callousness, on the coldly lit eyes and unflinching mouth, which readily suggested some terrible and recent experience--something potent enough to have dried up the human nature out of the man and left him soulless. His clothes had the impress of the ready-made, although he wore them with a distinction which was obviously inherent; and notwithstanding the fact that he seemed to have been writing, he wore gloves.|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--As {{surely as}} God is good, so surely {{there is no}} such thing as {{necessary}} evil. For by the religious mind sickness and pain and death are not to be accounted evils. Moral evils are of your own making, and undoubtedly the greater part of them may be prevented; though it is only in Paraguay (the most imperfect of Utopias) that any attempt at prevention has been carried into effect. Deformities of mind, as of body, will sometimes occur. Some voluntary castaways there will always be, whom no fostering kindness and no parental care can preserve from self-destruction; but if any are lost for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and culture, there is a sin of omission in the society to which they belong.|$|E
60|$|Upon the {{following}} evening Cuthbert proceeded to Worcester. He left his horse some little distance outside the town, and entered on foot. Having no apprehension of an attack, {{he had left}} all his pieces of armor behind, {{and was in the}} quiet garb of a citizen. Cnut attended him--for that worthy follower considered himself as responsible that no harm of any sort should befall his young master. The consequences of his own imprudence in the Tyrol were ever before his mind, and he determined that from henceforth there should be no <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> on his part. He accompanied Cuthbert to within a short distance of the convent, and took up his position {{in the shade of a}} house, whence he could watch should any one appear to be observing Cuthbert's entrance.|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{recovering from the}} fatigues of the session of 1869, Mr. Gladstone threw himself upon his new task, his imagination vividly excited by its magnitude and its possibilities. “For the last three months,” he writes to the Duke of Argyll (Dec. 5), “I have worked daily, I think, upon the question, and so I shall continue to do. The literature of it is large, larger than I can master; but I feel the benefit of continued reading upon it. We have before us a crisis, and a great crisis, for us all, {{to put it on}} no higher ground, and a great honour or a great disgrace. As I do not mean to fail through want of perseverance, so neither will I wilfully err through precipitancy, or through <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and desire at least to meet all apprehensions which are warranted by even the show of reason.” ...|$|E
40|$|The world's poor {{must not}} {{pay the price}} for the {{collapse}} of financial markets. Without immediate action, millions will suffer. Poor women and children will pay for the financial folly, failed ideology and crude self-interest that led to this crisis.

60|$|I foresaw the {{consequence}} of this, and attempted several times {{to persuade him to}} apply himself to his business; I put him in mind how his customers complained of the neglect of his servants on one hand, and how abundance broke in his debt, on the other hand, for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the clerk's <b>care</b> to secure him, and the like; but he thrust me by, either with hard words, or fraudulently, with representing the cases otherwise than they were.|$|R
50|$|The garden’s plant {{collection}} includes {{only a few}} extant examples {{dating from}} the Bartram family occupancy; however, documentation for what was once in cultivation is rich. The first century of public ownership left the garden <b>wanting</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and interpretation. Despite the disappearance {{of a number of}} subsidiary physical elements in the landscape, the garden’s rectilinear framework designed and laid out by Bartram during the second quarter of the eighteenth century is still recognizable.|$|R
