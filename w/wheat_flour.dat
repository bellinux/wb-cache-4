Factors Governing Pasting Properties of Waxy <b>Wheat</b> <b>Flours.</b> Cereal Chemistry, 92 (5), 529 - 535. doi: 10. 1094 /cchem- 10 - 14 - 0209 -rWaxy wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{contains}} endosperm starch {{lacking in}} amylose. To realize the full potential of waxy wheat, the pasting properties of hard waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> {{as well as}} factors governing the pasting properties were investigated and compared with normal and partial waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Starches isolated from six hard waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> had similar pasting properties, yet their corresponding flours had very different pasting properties. The differences in pasting properties were narrowed after endogenous alpha-amylase activity in waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> was inhibited by silver nitrate. Upon treatment with protease, the extent of protein digestibility influenced the viscosity profile in waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Waxy <b>wheat</b> starch granules swelled extensively when heated in water and exhibited a high peak viscosity, but they fragmented at high temperatures, resulting in more rapid breakdown in viscosity. The extensively swelled and fragmented waxy wheat starch granules were more susceptible to a-amylase degradation than normal wheat starch. A combination of endogenous a-amylase activity and protein matrix contributed to a large variation in pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Solvent Retention Capacity (SRC) {{tests have}} {{originally}} {{been designed to}} predict ﬂour functionality of North American <b>wheat</b> <b>ﬂours.</b> A SRC proﬁle consists of its Water Retention Capacity (WRC), Sodium Carbonate SRC (SCSRC), Sucrose SRC(SuSRC) and Lactic Acid SRC (LASRC) values. As the value of such tests when considering European <b>wheat</b> <b>ﬂours</b> is rather unclear, we studied the chemical composition and SRC proﬁles of nineteen commercial European <b>wheat</b> <b>ﬂours.</b> Their WRC, SCSRC, SuSRC and LASRC ranged from 56 to 66 %, 74 to 88 %, 90 to 102 % and 106 to 147 %, respectively. Both WRC and SCSRC were mostly {{higher than those of}} North American soft <b>wheat</b> <b>ﬂours,</b> but in the range of those of North American hard <b>wheat</b> <b>ﬂours.</b> For the entire set of European ﬂours, strong linear relations were observed between the ﬂour damaged starch levels and WRC values, as well as with SCSRC values. Modifying speciﬁc ﬂour constituent properties and levels illustrated the contribution of proteins, damaged starch and arabinoxylan (AX) to the SRC values. Flour proteins, especially glutenins, mainly contributed to LASRC, while damaged starch largely impacted ﬂour SCSRC. Water-extractable AX only contributed to the SuSRC values, whereas the solvent-accessible AX generally contributed to all SRC values, and particularly to the SuSRC values. status: publishe...|$|R
