5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In September 1879 the Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat {{converted}} by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and {{commanded by}} George <b>W.</b> <b>De</b> Long, entered the pack ice {{north of the}} Bering Strait. She remained ice-bound for nearly two years, drifting {{to the area of}} the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats and made for the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from the Jeannette appeared {{on the opposite side of}} the world, in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the drifting ice, included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine.|$|E
5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E

25|$|A rota {{is a form}} of round, {{known to}} have been used from the thirteenth century in England.

25|$|On 18 January 1989, Botha (then aged 73) {{suffered}} a mild stroke which {{prevented him from}} attending a meeting with Namibian political leaders on 20 January 1989. Botha's place was taken by acting president, J. Christiaan Heunis. On 2 February 1989, Botha resigned {{as leader of the}} National Party (NP) anticipating his nominee – finance minister Barend du Plessis – would succeed him. Instead, the NP's parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister F. <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> Klerk, who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party. In March 1989, the NP elected De Klerk as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was even considering running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in Cape Town, and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on 1 April 1989, Botha and De Klerk reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing de Klerk to take over as president.|$|E
25|$|Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress, {{its primary}} mission was give voting rights to black and mixed race Africans and, from the 1940s, to end Apartheid. The ANC {{originally}} attempted to use nonviolent protests to end apartheid, however, the Sharpeville massacre {{resulted in the}} deaths of 69 black Africans and contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of Charles Robberts Swart, banned the ANC and forced the party to leave South Africa. After the ban, the ANC formed the Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilizing guerrilla warfare and sabotage. On 3 February 1990, State President F. <b>W.</b> <b>de</b> Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and released Nelson Mandela on 11 February 1990. On 17 March 1992, the apartheid referendum was passed by the voters removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 60% in all general elections, including the most recent 2014 election.|$|E
