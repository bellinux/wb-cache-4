Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.|$|E

25|$|Stefan said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> out {{the last}} idea at his own house in England. He {{probably}} meant St Thomas's Mills at Stratford, London, which Henry had given him, then taken away in 1544. Stefan {{seems not to have}} found work, but he did come back to England. On 9 January 1547, the Imperial ambassador in London, François van der Delft, wrote to Mary of Austria to ask what he should do about Haschenperg. Stefan and his wife had come to London thinking that Mary's letters would get his job back. Van der Delft suggested he should not intercede between Henry VIII and his servant. Stefan then became a steward of Jan Dubravius, Bishop of Olmütz, in Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|Kulottunga married Madurantaki, {{of which}} Vikrama Chola, the {{successor}} of Kulottunga was perhaps fourth. This fact is re-iterated at several places {{the most notable}} being {{in one of his}} son's plates. She seems to have died sometime before the thirtieth year of Kulottunga (1110 CE). Another queen Thyagavalli took the place of the chief queen. Kalingathupparani mentions her and Elisai Vallabhi (also known as Elulagudayal). It also states that Thyagavalli enjoyed equal authority with the king. Solakulavalliyār, another queen of his is also mentioned in inscriptions. One of his queens was the daughter of the King of Ilangai namely Vikramabahu, whom he married with 1088 and with that arrangement Kulottunga I heralded peaceful relations between the Cholas and the Ilam country. This was a political move that also negated any influence the traditional allies of the Lankan kings, the Pandiyans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to exert on Vikramabahu. Following this marriage Lanka was allowed to be ruled with more freedom than under previous Chola kings, thus giving it a semblance of independent existence.|$|E

500|$|Tempos {{slowed to}} an oft dirge-like pace on Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978); Rehearsals and {{recording}} of the album stretched out over a long period, with Springsteen and bandmate and co-producer Steven Van Zandt experiencing a prolonged frustration over their inability to capture a more resonant drum sound. Weinberg soon regretted not playing faster on [...] "Badlands", and tempos did speed up on that number and some others during the accompanying Darkness Tour. [...] He did later say that [...] "It was a ballsy thing to play a single stroll roll through the entirety of 'Candy's Room'" [...] {{and that it was}} the kind of choice a session musician never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried.</b>|$|E
500|$|By general {{critical}} consent the libretto of [...] {{is a work}} of poor quality. The weak plot, as Bizet's biographer Winton Dean observes, {{turns on}} the unlikely coincidence regarding Leila's necklace, and no real effort is made in the text to bring any of the characters to life: [...] "They are the regulation sopranos, tenors, etc., with their faces blacked". Mina Curtiss, in her book on Bizet, dismisses the text as banal and imitative. Donal Henahan of The New York Times, writing in 1986, said that the libretto [...] "rank right down there with the most appallingly inept of its kind". The writers themselves admitted its shortcomings: Cormon commented later that had they been aware of Bizet's quality as a composer, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> harder. Carré was worried about the weak ending, and constantly sought suggestions for changing it; Curtiss records that in exasperation, the theatre manager Carvalho suggested that Carré burn the libretto. This facetious remark, Curtiss asserts, led Carré to end the opera with the fishermen's tents ablaze as Leila and Nadir make their escape.|$|E

500|$|Athletic {{authorities}} {{argued that}} Ward should not play {{because it would}} be discourteous to Georgia Tech, and he might be injured. [...] There was fear that if Ward played, he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended. [...] Playwright Arthur Miller, then a writer for Michigan’s student newspaper, learned first-hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African-American athlete. In his biography of Miller, Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who knew one of the Georgia Tech players. Brater described Miller’s involvement this way: “Remmel [...] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team, to protest but also to appeal to the athletes' sense of fair play. ‘Miller was {{right in the middle of}} this’, Remmel recalls. Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘the Yankee’ Miller ‘in salty language’, but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron. [...] ‘The Georgia Tech team was wild.’ [...] Miller was furious. He ‘went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it, but it was not published.’ [...] [...] [...] Remmel said that Miller ‘could not believe that the Georgia Tech team <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to destroy Willis Ward—but, I am sure they would have.’” ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Hayes {{quit the}} serial and her exit storyline played {{out the same}} year. It was {{initially}} left unclear what impact her departure would have on Miles'. Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she has to move with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't agree with what she did or how she did it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to talk her out of leaving {{if he had been}} made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings a little fun back into Miles' life." ...|$|E

It is fantastic, but of course, Auschwitz is fantastic, too". Browning {{testified that the}} Madagascar Plan was not [...] "Hitler's pipe dream" [...] as Irving claimed, and that [...] "I would not call it a pipe dream, because I think, if England had surrendered, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to do it.

2500|$|Around 5:00p.m., Lennon and Ono {{left the}} Dakota for a {{recording}} session at Record Plant Studios. As they walked toward their limousine, Chapman {{shook hands with}} Lennon and asked for him to sign {{a copy of his}} album, Double Fantasy. Amateur photographer Paul Goresh took a photo of Lennon signing Chapman's album. [...] Chapman later {{said in an interview that}} he tried to get Goresh to stay, and that he asked another Lennon fan lingering at the building's entrance to go out with him that night. He suggested that if the girl had accepted his invitation, or the photographer had stayed, he would not have murdered Lennon that evening; but he probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> another day.|$|E
2500|$|... "In any event, {{there was}} no cure for either disease in 1921," [...] wrote biographer Jonathan Alter. However, Dr. Samuel Levine, who first made a polio {{diagnosis}} in Roosevelt's case, mistakenly thought that the main benefit of a spinal tap, if done, would be to improve the outcome by lowering elevated CSF pressure. And even today, some authors mistakenly believe that Roosevelt's paralysis, assuming a polio diagnosis, {{could have been prevented}} with early intervention. However, there is no objective evidence that a spinal tap lessens the possibility of paralysis in polio. And it is unlikely Roosevelt's physicians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> human serum injections into the CSF, or that such injections would have helped. Lovett did not think the injections were useful, and there were alarming meningeal symptoms associated with them, probably secondary to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. Concerning GBS, virtually all of the effective measures that are currently standard practice for the medical management of GBS were not developed until many decades after Roosevelt's 1921 illness, so Roosevelt's prognosis would not have improved even if GBS had been diagnosed.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{attention}} created by this release and because of the strong live reputation they had built up through constant UK touring, a bidding war for the band ensued between major record labels. The band decided to sign with Island Records in the summer of 2003. After first being attracted to the band by the considerable industry buzz then surrounding them and from hearing [...] "Everybody's Changing" [...] on the radio, the Island A, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, told HitQuarters that he wanted to sign them after hearing the five songs [...] "Everybody’s Changing", [...] "This Is the Last Time", [...] "She Has No Time", [...] "Bend and Break" [...] and [...] "Somewhere Only We Know", saying that: [...] "every one of them was brilliant ... they had a fantastic live show [...] even if I hadn't been able to see them live, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to sign them anyway." [...] According to Unger-Hamilton, Keane chose to sign with Island because they got on well with the A and were convinced {{that he did not want}} to change them in any way.|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{few days}} of his conviction, Stevens faced {{bipartisan}} calls for his resignation. [...] Both parties' presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, were quick to call for Stevens to stand down. Obama said that Stevens needed to resign to help [...] "put an end to the corruption and influence-peddling in Washington." [...] McCain said that Stevens [...] "has broken his trust with the people" [...] and needed to step down—a call echoed by his running mate, Sarah Palin, governor of Stevens's home state. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as fellow Republican Senators Norm Coleman, John Sununu and Gordon Smith also called for Stevens to resign. McConnell said there would be [...] "zero tolerance" [...] for a convicted felon serving in the Senate—strongly hinting that he would support Stevens's expulsion from the Senate unless Stevens resigned first. Late on November 1, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confirmed that he would schedule a vote on Stevens's expulsion, saying that [...] "a convicted felon {{is not going to be}} able to serve in the United States Senate." [...] Had Stevens been expelled after winning election, a special election would have been held to fill the seat through the remainder of the term, until 2014. Some speculated Palin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to run for the Senate via this special election. No sitting Senator has been expelled since the Civil War.|$|E
