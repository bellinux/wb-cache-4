Thus, my position about the science of global climate change is one of resolute agnosticism. When it comes to climate change, the key issues are no longer about forcings, albedo, or the ideal concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, the key question is about policy, namely: if we are going to agree that carbon dioxide is bad, what are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> And that question—as the Duke of Bilgewater memorably put it in Huckleberry Finn—'is the bare bodkin.” ...|$|E

The women formed the Committee for Women's Suffrage (Komitée für das Frauenstimmrecht) to work towards gaining the vote. In 1971 and 1973, referenda failed with the majority blocking enfranchisement. Unable to make headway, in 1981, Marxer and other feminists formed Aktion Dornröschen, which technically means thorny rose, but was a play on words for the German name of the fairy tale [...] "Sleeping Beauty". The women brought a complaint to the Constitutional Court charging that their rights had been abridged. In 1982, the case was dismissed. The government refused to reevaluate the situation, forcing Marxer and 11 other Sleeping Beauty activists to take other action. They traveled throughout Europe speaking about their lack of rights. In 1983, they arrived in Strasbourg, France, where Marxer and the others brought their concerns before the Council of Europe. The move brought criticism at home, for putting the country in the international spotlight, but it was effective. On 2 July 1984, the male voters in Liechtenstein granted full voting rights to women.|$|E

The widespread exploitation of knowledge discovery has been synergistic with this realisation. Case-based reasoning represents part of Artificial Intelligence's scientific ambitions within problem solving and the search for efficient methods to define descriptive patterns and explanations within such 'a flood of data'. Theoretically it can be used when working with large amounts of historical data and in situations where {{there is a need to}} extract order from complex data.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of goodness in ethical thinking of Plato and Aristotle. The work aims to answer two research questions: How did Plato and Aristotle perceive the essence of goodness in human life? What are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order to accomplish human well-being? The first chapter contains a brief summary of ethical ideas of both philosophers. In the following chapters their concepts of areté, soul and goodness are analysed and compared. The comparison supports the fact that both Plato and Aristotle basically agreed on the essence of human goodness. They consider it the sole criterion of human well-being, both of them connect it with moral values and argue that it can be only achived through life in accordance with the virtues. On the other hand, Plato and Aristotle differ from each other in the way how can be such human goodness and well-being achieved. Aristotle's views based on the ethical issues, however, can not be perceived as totally different from those of Plato, but rather as a further elaboration and supplement of his ideas and opinions...|$|E

40|$|Paper-ballot {{elections}} {{may be a}} bit cumbersome {{yet many}} people will agree that the procedures to be followed are sufficiently transparent to all parties involved. The principles for fair elections are clear, and common sense tells people what to look for to detect potential fraud. The process is trans-parent. For computerized elections the principles for fair elections are not all that obvious anymore. In particular, the internet {{turns out to be a}} highway fraught with accidents, where breaches of security and privacy have become all too common. News items reporting on such incidents get to the general public on an almost daily basis. For elections to be considered fair in such hostile environments, new rules and standards need to be set in order to compensate for the lack of transparency. It is helpful to start looking at one of the problems to be solved by any voting system. Namely, the fundamental problem of achieving accuracy and ballot secrecy at the same time-assuming it is agreed that ballot secrecy is an essential ingredient for achieving democracy. Accuracy of the final tally means that it corresponds exactly to the ballots cast by legitimate voters. For instance, when voting by hand-raising it is easy to convince everybody of the correctness of the tally, but then there is no privacy. A common way for internet-based elections these days is to put up a secure web server (plus database) for collecting the votes. Assuming the web server somehow ascertains the identity of voters and allows only one vote per voter, the idea is that the web server will honestly process each ballot by keeping a running total and forgetting who exactly voted what. At the end of the day, a final tally may then be produced. Now suppose someone is not happy with the result, or rather, suppose not everybody believes it is the correct result, and a re-count is demanded. What are <b>we</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> We could show them the records representing the ballots again, and have them check the total. But these records need not have to do anything with the ballots cast by the legitimate voters: to protect the voters ’ privacy all identifying information has been removed. In fact, any audit trail for this type of system would violate ballot secrecy...|$|E
