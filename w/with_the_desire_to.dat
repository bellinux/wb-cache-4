5|$|Dissidia {{originated}} from Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura's desire {{to create a}} spin-off for the franchise, but it was changed to the Final Fantasy series. Besides designing the characters, Nomura worked with the Square staff <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> make it appealing to Western players. Dissidia was well received commercially and critically, with positive reviews and sales of over 1.8 million. A follow-up titled Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy was released in March 2011, and features several new characters and gameplay features.|$|E

He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials {{that must be}} {{completed}} to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey IslandTM, an act {{that was meant to}} win the love of the governor Elaine Marley.

5|$|At age {{fourteen}} he met Symeon the Studite (also called Symeon the Pious), a holy monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople. That meeting {{convinced the}} younger Symeon to forgo {{higher education and}} take on Symeon the Studite as his spiritual father. At that time he began studying the life of prayer and asceticism under his guidance, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> immediately enter the monastery. Symeon the Studite asked the young Symeon to wait before becoming a monk, so he spent the years until age twenty-seven serving in the household of a patrician, though according to some sources he served the emperor instead.|$|E

25|$|The pace {{of change}} towards more modern {{literary}} styles gained momentum in the early 19th century. Kannada writers were initially influenced by the modern literature of other languages, especially English. Modern English education and liberal democratic values inspired social changes, intertwined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> retain the best of traditional ways. New genres including short stories, novels, literary criticism, and essays, were embraced as Kannada prose moved toward modernisation.|$|E

25|$|Fasting {{is often}} used {{as a tool to}} make a {{political}} statement, to protest, or to bring awareness to a cause. A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt, or to achieve a goal such as a policy change.

25|$|On 3 August 2014, ISIL {{captured}} {{the cities of}} Zumar, Sinjar, and Wana in northern Iraq. Thousands of Yazidis fled up Mount Sinjar, fearful of the approaching hostile ISIL militants. The stranded Yazidis' need for food and water, the threat of genocide {{to them and to}} others announced by ISIL, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> protect US citizens in Iraq and support the Iraqi government in its fight against ISIL, were all reasons given for the 2014 American intervention in Iraq, which began on 7 August. A US aerial bombing campaign began the following day.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{a tribal}} leader from Patagonia {{approached}} him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{become part of}} the kingdom. Patagonia was therefore united to his kingdom as well.

He also attempted to involve the French government in his idea, but the French consul, after making some inquiries, {{came to the conclusion that}} de Tounens was insane.|$|E

The Runaways also prevent a zombie epidemic in Los Angeles. Molly also visits the X-Men in San Francisco and reconciles with Wolverine. The team is attacked while staying in Chase's parent's beach house. Old Lace is critically wounded saving Klara, who's powers cause foliage to keep the house from crumbling, but trapping everybody. A man alleging to be Chase's uncle appears and tries to help, but {{is followed by the}} military.

IFT also communicates with the news media, using sixty scientists to discuss the scientific perspective on food issues. IFT is also active in the international level by its membership in the International Union of Food Science and Technology, headquartered in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Education has always been a focus of IFT, going as far back as 1941, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have uniform education standards in food technology. Education standards for undergraduate students were approved by IFT in 1966 for food science and technology. These standards were revised and updated in 1977, 1992, 2001, and 2011. Today, IFT sits on the advisory council for the International Food Protection Training Institute.|$|E

2500|$|This {{design was}} in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> imitate <b>the</b> Eternal City, {{and with his}} {{ambition}} to found a [...] "second Rome" [...] at the river Tagus.

25|$|The Pergamene kingdom {{founded by}} Philetaerus at the {{beginning}} of the 3rd century BC was initially part of the Hellenistic Seleucid empire. Attalus I, successor and nephew of Eumenes I, was the first to achieve full independence for the territory and proclaimed himself king after his victory over the Celtic Galatians in 228 BC. This victory over the Galatians, a threat to the Pergamene kingdom, secured his power, which he then attempted to consolidate. With conquests in Asia Minor at the expense of the weakened Seleucids he could briefly increase the size of his kingdom. A Seleucid counteroffensive under Antiochos III reached the gates of Pergamon but could not put an end to Pergamene independence. Since the Seleucids were becoming stronger in the east, Attalus turned his attention westward to Greece and was able to occupy almost all of Euboea. His son, Eumenes II, further limited the influence of the Galatians and ruled alongside his brother Attalus II, who succeeded him. In 188 BC, Eumenes II was able to create the Treaty of Apamea as an ally of Rome, thus reducing the influence of the Seleucids in Asia Minor. The Attalids were thus an emerging power <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate their importance to the outside world through the construction of imposing buildings.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{reason was}} competition. Long Island Transit Systems, Inc., {{at the end}} of 1960 sought permission to operate express bus service via the Long Island Expressway and New York State Route 25 between New York City and Riverhead, where it would continue easterly by arrangement with Sunrise Coach Lines, Inc. to Greenport. At around this time, the LIRR proposed its own bus plan, and in July 1961 the Public Service Commission (PSC) ruled that Long Island Transit's petition was not in the public's best interest. However, it would grant the LIRR’s proposal if the railroad received agreement from local governments along the route by January 18, 1962. On January 17, 1962, the PSC authorized service as far as Southold and an extension to Greenport was granted later on. The buses first ran on Monday, February 19, 1962, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> triple passenger service in Central Suffolk and the North Fork. Because of its popularity, another bus route was initiated on the South Shore from Amityville to Montauk after approval from the PSC on May 10, 1963. This route ran along Montauk Highway from Shirley to the Shinnecock Canal. Six round trips a day would supplement rail service, and four new air-conditioned buses were ordered. Bus service began on this route on June 8, 1963.|$|E
