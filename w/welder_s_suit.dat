40|$|In 1959 Congress {{passed the}} Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). The {{goals of the}} Act were to {{guarantee}} the political and civil rights of union members within their unions and to make union officers more responsive to members 2 ̆ 7 welfare. Title IV of the Act established standards to ensure free and democratic union elections and empowered the Secretary of Labor to bring suit to overturn elections upon a member 2 ̆ 7 s complaint that those standards were breached. Congress made the Secretary 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>suit</b> the exclusive post-election remedy for election violations; union members cannot bring private actions. During the 1960 s the Supreme Court recognized the Secretary 2 ̆ 7 s broad authority to investigate complaints and bring suits in order to guarantee union democracy. However, the individual interest of the complaining union member was ignored by the courts until the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Trbovich v. UMW. There the Court held that the Title IV complainant {{has a right to}} intervene in the Secretary 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>suit.</b> Trbovich prompted greater judicial recognition of the complainant 2 ̆ 7 s rights. Most recently, the Supreme Court held in Dunlop v. Bachowski that the Secretary 2 ̆ 7 s decision not to sue is subject to judicial review at the instance of the complainant. This Note argues that judicial review under Bachowski has been unsatisfactory as a means of protecting individual rights and that the ultimate solution lies with the Department of Labor or Congress. The review process contravenes the statutory goals of Title IV 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement scheme and provides inadequate protection for the complainant 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the suit. Indeed, the problem underlying the Bachowski litigation is that the Labor Department 2 ̆ 7 s investigatory process does not have rules and procedures necessary to ensure openness, apparent fairness, and sufficient consideration of the complainant 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. The Note proposes that Congress overrule Bachowski by amending Title IV to preclude judicial review and that judicial review be replaced by administrative procedures within the Labor Department. The recommended procedures, providing for informal hearing and review analogous to that used in NLRB cases, would give complainants a more meaningful voice without impairing the special enforcement goals of Title IV...|$|R

40|$|To prevent plaintiffs from harassing the {{defendant}} or engaging in forum-shopping, {{the common law}} doctrine of forum non conveniens permits trial courts to dismiss a foreign plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>suit,</b> over which it would normally have jurisdiction, if both the parties 2 ̆ 7 convenience and the ends of justice are best served by dismissal. Supreme Court precedent requires courts to weigh a number of private and public interest factors, and gives foreign plaintiffs less deference in their choice of forum than a domestic plaintiff.

This Comment will highlight inconsistencies between the district court decisions affirmed in Abad, and it proposes that the Seventh Circuit should adjust the doctrine to ensure that district courts apply a consistent framework by (1) returning to the original conception of the doctrine set forth in Gilbert, (2) using a nation-to-nation analysis of the relative public interests, (3) adopting the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s sliding scale approach to the less deference rule, and (4) refusing to consider parties 2 ̆ 7 willingness to make concessions...|$|R
40|$|During the shock-wave {{propagation}} in a core-collapse supernova (SN), matter turbulence {{may affect}} neutrino flavor conversion probabilities. Such effects have been usually studied by adding parametrized small-scale random fluctuations (with arbitrary amplitude) {{on top of}} coarse, spherically symmetric matter density profiles. Recently, however, two-dimensional (2 D) SN models have reached a space resolution high enough to directly trace anisotropic density profiles, down to scales smaller than the typical neutrino oscillation length. In this context, we analyze the statistical properties of a large set of SN matter density profiles obtained in a high-resolution 2 D simulation, focusing on a post-bounce time (2 <b>s)</b> <b>suited</b> to study shock-wave effects on neutrino propagation on scales as small as O(100) km and possibly below. We clearly find the imprint of a broken (Kolmogorov-Kraichnan) power-law structure, as generically expected in 2 D turbulence spectra. We then compute the flavor evolution of SN neutrinos along representative realizations of the turbulent matter density profiles, and observe no or modest damping of the neutrino crossing probabilities on {{their way through the}} shock wave. In order to check the effect of possibly unresolved fluctuations at scales below O(100) km, we also apply a randomization procedure anchored to the power spectrum calculated from the simulation, and find consistent results within ± 1 sigma fluctuations.

Among the various components of subjective well-being, the SWLS is narrowly focused to assess global life satisfaction and does niot tap related constructs such as positive affect or loneliness.

The seaman then moved to amend his complaint to allege an action directly against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The United States objected that venue in the Southern District was improper under the act which provided that “Any civil action on a tort claim against the United States... may be prosecuted only in the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred. ” The seaman resided in New Jersey, and the alleged aggravation occurred in a hospital in the Eastern District of New York.

40|$|Designing a {{planetary}} suit is very complex and often requires difficult trade-offs between performance, cost, mass, and system complexity. In order to verifying that new suit designs meet requirements, full prototypes must eventually be built and tested with human subjects. Using computer models {{early in the}} design phase of new hardware development can be advantageous, allowing virtual prototyping to take place. Having easily modifiable models of the suit hard sections may reduce {{the time it takes}} to make changes to the hardware designs and then to understand their impact on suit and human performance. A virtual design environment gives designers the ability to think outside the box and exhaust design possibilities before building and testing physical prototypes with human subjects. Reductions in prototyping and testing may eventually reduce development costs. This study is an attempt to develop computer models of the hard components of the suit with known physical characteristics, supplemented with human subject performance data. Objectives: The primary objective was to develop an articulating solid model of the Mark III hip bearings to be used for evaluating suit design performance of the hip joint. Methods: Solid models of {{a planetary}} prototype (Mark III) <b>suit</b> <b>s</b> hip bearings and brief section were reverse-engineered from the prototype. The performance of the models was then compared by evaluating the mobility performance differences between the nominal hardware configuration and hardware modifications. This was accomplished by gathering data from specific suited tasks. Subjects performed maximum flexion and abduction tasks while in a nominal suit bearing configuration and in three off-nominal configurations. Performance data for the hip were recorded using state-of-the-art motion capture technology. Results: The results demonstrate that solid models of planetary suit hard segments for use as a performance design tool is feasible. From a general trend perspective, the suited performance trends were comparable between the model and the suited subjects. With the three off-nominal bearing configurations compared to the nominal bearing configurations, human subjects showed decreases in hip flexion of 64 %, 6 %, and 13 % and in hip abduction of 59 %, 2 %, and 20 %. Likewise the solid model showed decreases in hip flexion of 58 %, 1 %, and 25 % and in hip abduction of 56 %, 0 %, and 30 %, under the same condition changes from the nominal configuration. Differences seen between the model predictions and the human subject performance data could be attributed to the model lacking dynamic elements and performing kinematic analysis only, the level of fit of the subjects with the suit, the levels of the subject <b>s</b> <b>suit</b> experience...|$|R

It consists of a methodology database and a set of laptops in a local area network, most often arranged at a horseshoe-shaped table in a meeting room.|$|R
