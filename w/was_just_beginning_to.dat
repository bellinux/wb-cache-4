5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> open up. A few lensmakers and natural {{philosophers}} had been creating crude microscopes {{since the late}} 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But {{it was not until}} Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

25|$|Baker <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> hit {{his stride}} as a {{landscape}} painter in the Realism movement {{when he died}} on November 20, 1886 {{at the age of}} 26 of a cold at his father's house at Hoosick Falls, New York after sustaining injuries while ice skating. His final work was Meadow Brook. Baker completed over 130 paintings in his career.|$|E
25|$|Oral hairy leukoplakia {{was first}} {{described}} by Greenspan et al. in 1984, {{a few years}} after the start of the AIDS epidemic. A link with OHL was not initially reported as scientific understanding of HIV/AIDS <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> unfold during this time. Later, it was thought to occur only in HIV-infected, homosexual males, however this is now known not always to be the case.|$|E

Cuyen's mother was Hahana-jacing of the Tunggiya clan, Nurhaci's primary wife, who also gave birth to the prince Daišan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the fifteenth}} attempt {{since the war}} we won at Melbourne...It was then that I felt that the great Australian team <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate. The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on {{previous}} occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
25|$|The AAFC was an eight-team {{league that}} played from 1946–49. Since it emerged {{at a time}} when the NFL <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> recover from the war years (when some teams {{temporarily}} merged), was national in scope and had owners wealthier than most of their NFL counterparts, it posed a serious competitive threat to the older league. The NFL took many steps to prevent the AAFC from making headway, blacklisting media who had covered the league as well as players who jumped to it.|$|E

25|$|Blackpool {{finished}} the 1949–50 season in seventh place. A quarter-final defeat at Liverpool ended the club's FA Cup interest for another season. Blackpool's reserve team, however, won the Central League championship, scoring 82 {{goals in the}} process. They were assisted significantly by Jackie Mudie, who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{knock on the door}} of the first team. Other new members included the amateur Bill Slater and Bill Perry. Out went goalkeeper Joe Robinson, who was unable to win back the number-one jersey from Farm, as well as Alex Munro, who retired, and Ron Suart, who joined Blackburn.|$|E
25|$|Saint Louis de Montfort's devotions and consecrations were {{developed}} {{in the first few}} years of the 18th century, and did not explicitly refer to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> gain a following at about the same time in France, but had not yet received Church approval. Saint Francis de Sales began to write on the perfections of the Heart of Mary as the model of love for God in the early parts of the 17th century and his work influenced St. Jean Eudes, who then developed the joint devotion to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.|$|E
25|$|From October 30 – 31, {{this low}} {{pressure}} system slowly became better organized over Texas, before it ejected north over the Mississippi River Valley. This meridonal trajectory {{of a low}} pressure track (almost due north from the western Gulf) is climatologically favorable to produce very heavy snowfall in the winter months because it allows copious amounts of moisture to flow north where it can interact with colder air. Cooler readings lingered {{at the very end}} of October across the Upper Midwest, and a re-enforcing pool of Arctic air <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> push southeast through the western Canadian Provinces.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, they {{contacted}} Walt Disney, who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> plan a {{new type}} of amusement park in California. Disney admired Arrow's work and hired them to help design build the vehicles for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of Disneyland's original and early rides, including Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White's Scary Adventures. Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Autopia, and Alice in Wonderland in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the King Arthur Carrousel.|$|E
25|$|The design <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> mature in late 1941 {{when the}} Luftwaffe began {{low-level}} attacks. A prototype version, the Mk. VII entered {{service on the}} Bristol Beaufighter in November 1941. A small number of these were sent to units across the UK to provide coverage at low altitudes while Mk. IV equipped aircraft operated at higher altitudes. After a small run of the improved Mk. VIIIA, the definitive Mk. VIII arrived in early 1942, offering higher power {{as well as a}} host of electronic and packaging upgrades. It arrived just as supplies of the De Havilland Mosquito began to improve, quickly displacing the older units in RAF squadrons. Mk. VIII equipped Mosquitoes would be the premier night fighter from 1943 {{through the rest of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Gryce and {{the other}} {{personnel}} from the Hampton Band returned to New York in November 1953, where the hard bop scene <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> gain traction. This was the perfect time for Gryce to arrive on the scene. Soon after his return, he recorded with Henri Renaud, and Art Blakey recorded seven of Gryce's songs for EmArcy records. Gryce formed a quintet with Farmer in March 1954, which first recorded for Prestige Records in May of that year. Personnel included pianist Horace Silver, bassist Percy Heath, and Drummer Kenny Clarke. Gryce's works with Farmer are {{some of his most}} influential and best known. In June of that year Gryce again recorded with Farmer, this time exclusively as composer and arranger. By the time Farmer and Gryce began their third project, they had hit their creative stride.|$|E

500|$|The storm {{system that}} would become Isidore {{originated}} in a nearly stationary frontal boundary situated near the Bahamas. On September 24, a ship reported winds of about [...] {{in association with the}} disturbance. However, satellite imagery indicated that convection <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> organize. Satellite imagery and Air Force reconnaissance reports documented the formation of a tropical depression early on September 25; a special statement was later issued by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) confirming the existence of the depression, and tropical cyclone advisories were initiated at 12 pm EDT. The depression moved west-northwest while tracking through the Bahamas. As it did so, it moved across Cat Island and passed near several others. The cyclone attained tropical storm status on September 26, receiving the name [...] "Isidore".|$|E
