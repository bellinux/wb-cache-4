Ion, his brother, was born in 1859 and died in 1892, being {{the only one of}} Mihail Kogălniceanu's male children to have heirs. His line was still surviving in 2001. Ion's son, also named Mihail, established the Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation in 1935 (in 1939–1946, it published a magazine named Arhiva Românească, which aimed to be a new series of the one published during the 1840s; its other projects were rendered ineffectual by the outbreak of World War II).|$|E

25|$|Pontesbury was abbot from 1488 {{to about}} 1521. His failings {{seem to have}} been mainly in {{management}} both of resources and people, revealed in visitations in 1518 and 1521. Because revenues were being misapplied, the buildings were in need of repair, particularly the infirmary, dormitory, chapter house, and library. Pontesbury seems to have complained about this to the bishop as if he himself were not responsible. Liturgical life was suffering because of lack of instruction for the novices. Worse still, canons were visiting Shrewsbury, a woman of ill-repute was frequenting the abbey, and there <b>were</b> <b>boys</b> in the dormitory.|$|E

25|$|It was however Ravi Varma's {{daughters who}} were {{singled out by}} destiny for greatness, {{although}} not {{in the field of}} art, nor personally, but through their daughters. The three daughters of Ravi Varma and Bhageerthi Bayi were Mahaprabha Amma (who features in two of Varma's most famous paintings), Uma Amma (named after Varma's mother) and Cheria Kochamma. In 1900 CE, the Royal House of Travancore once again faced a succession crisis. Bhageerthi's two elder sisters, who had been adopted in order to carry forward the lineage, had failed to produce the desired heirs. They had had six children between them, but only two of those had survived, and both <b>were</b> <b>boys</b> (who also, incidentally, later died childless). According to the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system, the succession to the throne could only progress through females, and therefore it was necessary to make an adoption. Tradition dictated that two girls belonging to branches of the Royal Family be adopted together. They would be designated the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and the succession to the throne of Travancore would be vested in their progeny, in accordance with the unusual and unique Marumakkathayam system of succession.|$|E
500|$|For {{the main}} characters, Bigelow {{made a point}} of casting {{relatively}} unknown actors: [...] "it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability." [...] Renner's character, Sergeant First Class William James, is a composite character, with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal knew when embedded with the bomb squad. Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in Dahmer, a film about Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer whose victims <b>were</b> <b>boys.</b> To prepare for the film, Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin, a U.S. military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California. He was taught to use C4 explosives, learned how to render safe improvised explosive devices, and how to wear a bomb suit.|$|E
500|$|Aretha Franklin and Rod Stewart also {{recorded}} [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] {{around the same}} time, and both of their renditions were popular.

Johnny Cash recorded it on his 1975 album Sings Precious Memories, dedicating it to his older brother Jack, {{who had been killed}} in a mill accident when they <b>were</b> <b>boys</b> in Dyess, Arkansas. Cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following Jack's death. Cash often included the song when he toured prisons, saying [...] "For the three minutes that song is going on, everybody is free. It just frees the spirit and frees the person." ...|$|E
