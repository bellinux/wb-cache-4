5000|$|<b>Wind-on</b> <b>lever</b> makes {{camera ready}} in one quick {{operation}} for continuous shooting.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} camera top, hinged at the front, is a flush {{cover with}} no protruding controls. When flipped open, it reveals the waist-level finder. On {{the right-hand side}} is the single-stroke <b>wind-on</b> <b>lever</b> with the manual reset frame counter on top, and next to it the remote-release-threaded shutter button. On the left-hand side is the rewind knob with a film reminder on top. When the top lid is fully opened, the large square magnifier swings up over the focusing screen. An action finder is also incorporated into the top cover. At the base are the Â¼ inch tripod socket, the A/R (advance/rewind) switch, and a release button for the removable back.|$|E
50|$|The Canonflex was {{inspired}} to an extent by the company's rangefinder camera models. It has a thumb-operated <b>wind-on</b> <b>lever</b> on the camera's base and a removable meterless finder prism, which slides off after depressing {{a button on the}} left hand camera front. The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the shutter release to the left, before or while depressing the release button. It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it was replaced by the Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Miranda T 35mm SLR {{camera was}} {{launched by the}} newly established Japanese Orion Camera Co. in 1955. It is the first Japanese 35mm SLR camera to have an eyelevel Pentaprism finder. The camera was a success, and after only two years, the manufacturer {{changed its name to}} the Miranda Camera Co. The camera stayed in production for two more years while a series of new models designated model A, B, C, D, and S were introduced, based on the original camera. These comprised improvements like a faster shutter with 1/1000-second top speed, a frame counter, <b>wind-on</b> <b>lever,</b> and an Instant return mirror on model B in 1958. In addition, a rare Miranda TII with 1/1000-second top shutter speed does exist.|$|E
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The <b>wind-on</b> <b>lever</b> on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at the shutter setting B and is only settable after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand take-up spool was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|E
