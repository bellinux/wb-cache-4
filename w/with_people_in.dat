5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

At certain points, Ochi and her back-up band are represented as cartoons, and in others, Ochi performs the song <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> gorilla suits.|$|E
