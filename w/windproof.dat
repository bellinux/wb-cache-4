25|$|By August 1940, the War Office {{produced}} training {{instructions for}} the creation and use of Molotov cocktails. The instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure breakage and providing fuel-soaked rag, <b>windproof</b> matches or a length of cinema film (made of highly flammable nitrocellulose) {{as a source of}} ignition.|$|E
25|$|While {{in command}} of III Corps, Parsons oversaw {{development}} and fielding of a new field jacket, the M-1941, which {{was used by the}} Army throughout World War II. Parsons had launched the project after identifying a need to replace the wool coat then in use with an outer garment that was lightweight, water repellent, and <b>windproof,</b> and could incorporate a liner for warmth during the winter.|$|E
5000|$|A {{consequence}} of the <b>windproofing</b> {{is that it is}} hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut the fuel. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable [...] "clink" [...] sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable [...] "clunk" [...] when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fleet of}} seven Ferguson TE-20s were {{used on the}} 1955-58 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition which was led by Edmund Hillary. Four {{petrol-engined}} and three diesel models were used. Some were supplied as half-tracks, with steerable front skis, whilst others of the New Zealand team were fitted with an extra wheel on each side and full caterpillar tracks, developed by the expedition in the Antarctic. In both cases, the track kits were easily removable and in light conditions the tractors were used on standard wheels and tyres. A canvas cabin was added for <b>windproofing.</b> Other than this, the tractors were totally standard - two were even fitted with a standard farmyard hydraulic front-loader for loading and unloading supplies. Reports were made at regular intervals to the Ferguson company and these show the tractors to have been reliable and effective - being capable of climbing a 1-in-7 slope of [...] "hard polished ice where a man cannot walk without crampons", as well as operating in conditions of −10 degrees Fahrenheit. Under Hillary these tractors were driven to the South Pole, becoming the first vehicles to be driven to the pole, and the first overland journey to the pole since Captain Scott. The tractors were left at the pole {{for the use of}} American researchers. One of the tractors used by Hillary's party was later repatriated to New Zealand and is on display along with other British Trans-Antarctic Expedition vehicles in the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand.|$|R
500|$|The British Army uniform has sixteen categories, {{ranging from}} {{ceremonial}} uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. No. 8 Dress, the day-to-day uniform, {{is known as}} [...] "Personal Clothing System – Combat Uniform" [...] (PCS-CU) and consists of a Multi-Terrain Pattern (MTP) <b>windproof</b> smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with ancillary items such as thermals and waterproofs. The army has introduced tactical recognition flashes (TRFs); worn on the right arm of a combat uniform, the insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps.|$|E
500|$|Fred Dibnah, Steeplejack won the 1979 BAFTA {{award for}} best documentary, {{and over the years}} Haworth {{returned}} to film more documentaries. With his newly found fame, however, came distractions from his work. Visitors would arrive at his house, to see his garden. He began to receive fan mail; one individual wrote to offer Dibnah a steam-powered machine he no longer wanted. One company, who were apparently disturbed to see Dibnah's matches being extinguished by the wind while {{at the top of a}} chimney, sent him a sample of their <b>windproof</b> matches. Filming would also interfere with his work. Cameraman Martin Lightening would climb with [...] Dibnah to the top of a chimney—with a 16mm film camera—and film him at work, often hundreds of feet above the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Jockstraps {{are fairly}} {{consistent}} in design with variations appearing in details like width of waistband and fabrics. Some jockstraps {{are designed for}} specific sports: Swim jocks, for example, have a narrow waistband, and hockey jocks sometimes have adjustable elastic straps and garter clips that hold hockey socks in place while the bulky goalie protector has genital and abdominal foam padding. <b>Windproof</b> jockstraps have a special layer of fabric to protect the wearer from wind and cold in winter sports. Jockstraps are made in other materials as fetish wear. Aside from the aforementioned [...] "fashion jockstraps", the 2000s have seen a resurgence in jockstrap designs and brands.|$|E
2500|$|The clock's {{movement}} {{is famous for}} its reliability. The designers were the lawyer and amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison, and George Airy, the Astronomer Royal. Construction was entrusted to clockmaker Edward John Dent; after his death in 1853 his stepson Frederick Dent completed the work, in 1854. As the tower was not complete until 1859, Denison had time to experiment: instead of using the deadbeat escapement and remontoire as originally designed, Denison invented the double three-legged gravity escapement. This escapement provides the best separation between pendulum and clock mechanism. The pendulum is installed within an enclosed <b>windproof</b> box beneath the clockroom. It is [...] long, weighs , suspended on a strip of spring steel 1/64 inch in thickness, and beats every 2 seconds. The clockwork mechanism in a room below weighs 5 tons.|$|E
50|$|The Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> DPM (or, DPM <b>Windproof</b> Smock) {{was issued}} {{alongside}} the standard DPM Combat Jackets by the British Army. The Special Air Service Regiment {{was the first}} unit to adopt its own design of DPM <b>Windproof</b> Smock which it wore in preference to the 68 Pattern and later combat jackets. Aside from being made from a <b>windproof</b> material, it differed from the standard combat jackets in being cut to fit more loosely, allowing it to fit over other layers of clothing more easily, and in having an integral hood. Where the standard jackets were closed by a full-length zipper, covered by a buttoned flap, and buttoned cuffs, the <b>windproof</b> smock used velcro to close the flap over the zipper and to fasten the cuffs. The buttons fitted to the <b>Windproof</b> Smock (on the four, expanding front pockets, and the small arm pocket for the First Field Dressing) were all of an overlarge type, to ease use by cold or gloved fingers.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{a similar}} DPM <b>Windproof</b> smock was {{introduced}} (the Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> Arctic), this was primarily issued to Royal Marine Commandos and Army units {{assigned to the}} AMF(L) for arctic warfare. This differed from the Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> DPM in that it had button-on rank tabs on the chest and back, {{as well as a}} wire stiffener for the hood. The general issue Combat Soldier 95 combat jacket followed this pattern, but omitting the rank tab on the back which tended to snag on rucksacks, camouflage netting and so forth.|$|E

50|$|Variations of the 'Windproof' {{have been}} the basic Special Forces smock until the present, with several {{alternative}} colours seen over the years - white (or at least natural cotton) for LRDG's desert use; olive green; black; and, in now very rare later issues of the Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> 1963 Pattern, the DPM introduced in the late 1960s. The current issue Smock, <b>Windproof</b> is in the latest variation of the DPM design.|$|E

5000|$|Today, gilets {{are often}} worn as an outer layer, for extra warmth outdoors. Fashion gilets {{may be made}} of cloth or fake fur, or knitted. Sports gilets are often <b>windproof</b> and/or made of fleece. High-end hiking jackets often have an {{integral}} gilet inside them, that can be zipped on and off. Racing cyclists use thin light gilets with a <b>windproof</b> front and mesh back. Shooting gilets are rugged and made of leather. Short, overwear gilets are called [...] "bodywarmers" [...] in the UK.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Windproof</b> Smocks are clothing. They {{usually come}} with hoods and {{matching}} trousers worn as over garments to prevent cold air, {{and in some}} cases water, passing though.|$|E
50|$|A jacket made of {{a revolutionary}} {{material}} that changes color with temperature variations due to its special chemical composition. The “Ice Jacket” is also highly waterproof and <b>windproof.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the Royal Marines, {{which had}} a {{responsibility}} for NATO's northern flank, a Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> Arctic and Trousers, <b>Windproof,</b> Arctic were introduced circa 1972. These were made in a lightweight, but wind-proof, DPM fabric and could be worn over quilted jacket and trousers in extreme cold conditions. The design of both smock and trousers differ radically from both the standard and para designs. The smock is long and loose-fitting, and incorporates a voluminous wired-rim hood, while the trousers have zips in the lower leg {{to allow them to}} be put on over boots.|$|E
5000|$|Material {{for making}} the bags is mainly the polyethylene. [...] This fabrics are being knitted {{horizontally}} and vertically, and it is tightly knitted to create characteristics of <b>windproof,</b> waterproof, and also highly durable.|$|E
5000|$|Weathershields (made by {{a company}} called DryBike) are small water- and <b>windproof</b> shields that attach to the {{handlebars}} and protect the hands from rain and wind. Though not gloves, they serve a similar purpose.|$|E

50|$|Assembling a {{horizontally}} positioned rocket {{is relatively}} simple as all modules are easily accessible. Also, assembling the rocket in vertical position {{would require a}} <b>windproof</b> highrise hangar, which was not considered economically feasible {{at the time the}} rocket was designed.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized [...] "windproof" [...] butane {{lighters}} {{are manufactured}} for demanding {{conditions such as}} shipboard, high altitude, and wet climates. Some dedicated models double as synthetic rope cutters. Such lighters are often far hotter than normal lighters (those that use a [...] "soft flame") and can burn in excess of 1100 C. Contrary to common misconception, the <b>windproof</b> capabilities are not achieved from [...] "higher pressure" [...] fuel, with lighters using the same fuel (butane) as standard lighters, and therefore developing the same vapour pressure. Instead, <b>windproof</b> lighters mix the fuel with air, and pass the butane/air mixture through a catalytic coil. An electric spark starts the initial flame, and soon after the coil is hot enough to sustain a catalytic reaction and cause the fuel/air mixture to burn on contact.|$|E
5000|$|A garment with {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and colours to the Denison Smock, in lighter-weight denim, the 1942 Pattern Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> was also commonly issued to scouts and snipers in infantry battalions, from 1943, but most notably the SAS/SBS/SOE and Commando squads. It is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as the}} [...] "SAS Windproof". It was not designed much for parachuting, and lacked a crotch flap, having a drawstring hem instead. The most distinctive point of difference between 'Windproofs' and the Denison smock are that the former are hooded. A matching set of over-trousers was produced to complement the smock. Both items were screen printed with colour-fast pigments in a bold splinter design, with colours {{similar to that of the}} Denison.Variations of the 'Windproof' have been the basic Special Forces smock until the present, with several alternative colours seen over the years - white (or at least natural cotton) for LRDG's desert use; olive green; black; and, in now very rare later issues of the Smock, <b>Windproof,</b> 1963 Pattern, the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) introduced in the late 1960s. The current issue Smock, <b>Windproof</b> is in the latest variation of the DPM design.The camouflage pattern of the [...] "SAS Windproof" [...] was used as the basis of the post World War II Belgian Paratrooper Smock with very similar overtrousers.|$|E
50|$|After {{first aid}} or other initial medical treatment, {{the patient is}} placed in the {{toboggan}} wrapped in a vacuum mattress or insulating pads, and wrapped with a <b>windproof</b> blanket. Heat reflective emergency blankets reflect thermal radiation and heating packs, hot water bottles, or electric blankets might be used to warm the patient.|$|E
50|$|Many advertised {{so-called}} flameless lighters are not flameless at all, but {{the flame}} is invisible (such as a <b>windproof</b> lighter). If {{a piece of}} paper can easily be ignited, it is probably not a true flameless lighter and may not be safe in hazardous environments where smoking is confined to specific safe areas.|$|E
5000|$|... "Although {{a status}} symbol in the British Army, the Denison," [...] wrote ex-SAS officer, Barry Gregory, [...] "was <b>windproof</b> but not {{waterproof}} and stank after use like a coal-miner's sweat shirt. I {{used it in}} extremis as a pillow when sleeping out with sleeping-bag and poncho to keep my head above ground level." ...|$|E
5000|$|Windstopper is {{a fabric}} {{laminate}} made by W. L. Gore & Associates. It {{is similar to}} Gore-Tex, except {{that it is only}} <b>windproof</b> and breathable, not waterproof. One of the most common applications is a lamination with Polar fleece, since the lack of wind resistance is one of the principal drawbacks of that fabric.|$|E
50|$|Gore {{requires}} that all garments made from their material have taping over the seams, to eliminate leaks. Gore's sister product, Windstopper, {{is similar to}} Gore-Tex in being <b>windproof</b> and breathable, but has ability to stretch and is not waterproof. The Gore naming system does not imply specific technology or material but instead specific set of performance characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Regular polar fleece is not <b>windproof</b> {{and does}} not absorb {{moisture}} (although this is often seen as a benefit, per above). Fleece readily generates static electricity, which causes the accumulation of lint, dust, and pet hair. It is also susceptible to damage from high temperature washing, tumble drying, or ironing. Lower-quality polar fleece material is also prone to pilling.|$|E
