5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate <b>world</b> <b>than</b> traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that a sequel to Wall Street, to be subtitled Money Never Sleeps, was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the one he once oversaw. Charlie Sheen would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a cameo role. Daryl Hannah would not {{be involved in the}} sequel.|$|E

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} <b>world</b> <b>than</b> he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this {{was done in the}} midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate itself {{released}} {{four more}} Filmation games. Alien 8 (1985) was rushed for release before developers {{had an opportunity}} to react to Knight Lore, though Retro Gamer said that its rush was not noticeable, as Alien 8 had a larger game <b>world</b> <b>than</b> Knight Lore, with even more puzzles. Alien 8 and Knight Lore are similar in gameplay, but the former is set in outer space. With the updated Filmation II engine, Nightshade (1985) added colour and scrolling graphics (in place of flip-screen room changes); however, Retro Gamer regarded its gameplay as comparatively dull. Gunfright (1986), reported as the Stampers' last game, also used Filmation II and was more robust than its predecessor. Pentagram (1986) returned to flip-screen rooms and its action-based gameplay included shooting enemies. It sold poorly and was the last Sabreman game. Meanwhile, the Stamper brothers sought to enter the burgeoning console industry. They sold Ultimate to U.S. Gold in the mid-1980s and established Rare to develop Nintendo console games. While Ultimate's last two isometric games were of lesser quality, consumer interest in the genre endured.|$|E

25|$|Like capital, labor {{movements}} {{are not permitted}} in the Heckscher–Ohlin world, since this would drive an equalization of relative abundances of the two production factors, {{just as in the}} case of capital immobility.

25|$|A {{reaction}} to eschatological sensationalism - The millennial fervor of premillennialists {{as the year}} AD 500 was nearing caused them to have overly jovial celebrations (some septa-/sextamillennial interpreters calculated Jesus’s birth to have happened 5,500 years after creation). These feasts appeared to Augustine to take more pleasure in the physical <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the spiritual. Such earthly revelry was repulsive to Augustine since he placed little value on the material world.|$|E
25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea {{that it is better}} for the children to suffer want in this <b>world</b> <b>than</b> that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E

25|$|Wells {{also wrote}} an essay titled 'Intelligence on Mars', {{published}} in 1896 in the Saturday Review, which sets out {{many of the}} ideas for the Martians and their planet that are used almost unchanged in The War of the Worlds. In the essay he speculates {{about the nature of}} the Martian inhabitants and how their evolutionary progress might compare to humans. He also suggests that Mars, being an older <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the Earth, might have become frozen and desolate, conditions that might encourage the Martians to find another planet on which to settle.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Mystics, Froud portrayed {{them as being}} more connected to the natural <b>world</b> <b>than</b> their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey {{the idea that they}} were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson himself could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historians and}} admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and {{industrialist}} J. R. D. Tata have expressed {{the opinion that}} Patel {{would have made a}} better prime minister for India than Nehru. These admirers and Nehru's critics cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of Goa by military action and Nehru's rejection of Patel's advice on China. Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship of what was to be later known as the Amul co-operative project. However, A. G. Noorani, in comparing Nehru and Patel, writes that Nehru had a broader understanding of the <b>world</b> <b>than</b> Patel.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{pronounced}} {{in detail in}} Parthian art is the painted murals. Numerous examples are available in Dura Europos. Some examples are from Palmyra and Hatra and fragments of wall paintings {{have been found in}} Ashur and Babylon. Many of the murals come from temples and houses of worship. In the synagogue and the church of Dura Europos there are mainly scenes from the Bible. In Mitraeum there are scenes of the deity Mithras. In some temples of the city there are figures of donors and their family members prominently depicted. Residential buildings were much less likely to be painted in the Parthian <b>world</b> <b>than</b> in the Greco-Roman word.
