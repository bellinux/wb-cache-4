Proverbs relating specifically to animals were prevalent in both countries which allows for an interesting and contrasting view.

40|$|After {{reviewing}} the database of calendar and <b>weather</b> <b>proverbs</b> in Romance-speaking areas (BADARE) and listing items culled from several Romance atlases, I present three samples of regional variation {{in this kind}} of proverbs in Ibero-Romance referring to (1) the meaning of the rainbow and (2) of a red sky, and (3) images associated with a cumulus sky. The material of great interest contained in Romance atlases is complemented by other works related to languages and linguistic geography: proverb collections, dialect monographs and various other studies. Although the project of putting together a large Romance atlas of proverbs does not seem feasible even if conceived of as a second generation atlas, {{due to the fact that}} <b>weather</b> <b>proverbs</b> (or other types of proverbs) are a rare treat in the first generation atlases, it is suggested that the material in the BADARE database can be used to good advantage to facilitate the study of Romance proverb geography...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} sayings in English that are {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "proverbs", such as weather sayings. Alan Dundes, however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: [...] "Are <b>weather</b> <b>proverbs</b> proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'" [...] The definition of [...] "proverb" [...] has also changed over the years. For example, the following was labeled [...] "A Yorkshire proverb" [...] in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, [...] "as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth". The changing of the definition of [...] "proverb" [...] is also noted in Turkish.|$|R

40|$|Together with vellerisms, {{agricultural}} sayings, <b>weather</b> prognostics, dialogic <b>proverbs,</b> and {{the so-called}} antiproverbs, priamels belong to the vast and diversified family of proverbs. In paremiological research priamels {{have been in the}} state of neglect. What is more, they hardly ever become the subject of comparative research. The following paper is a pioneering attempt at comparing a selected group of contemporary German and Dutch priamels, both of which belong to West Germanic languages and are closely related to one another. The current research is based on two proverb dictionaries: Huizinga’s spreekwoorden en gezegden (Baarn 1994) which was edited by Agava Kuijssen, Carl van den Bergen, Patricie de Groot, Veronique Leenden and Ellen van Slijpen, and which contains 12027 entries; and the five-volume Deutsches Sprichwörter-Lexikon (Leipzig 1867 – 1880) which was edited by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander, and which contains about 250 000 entries. The present paper aims at providing German equivalents of Dutch priamels. The applied method hinges on an unilateral Dutch–German comparative analysis. 74 priamels have been extracted from the first abovementioned dictionary, then their German equivalents have been sought in Wander’s dictionary. The equivalents have been divided into the following three levels of equivalence: full, partial and zero equivalence. It has been shown that only 20 Dutch priamels have their full equivalence in German, 10 have partial equivalence, and 44 have no equivalence at all...|$|R
