Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to write the screenplay for the propaganda film Victory and Peace, designed to show <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a German invasion. Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918.

We cannot solve the fundamental dilemma of the inability to run controlled experiments to determine <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> a given instance without direct governmental investment, but we have assembled a better set of data than was available to previous studies. From these we hope to narrow the range of plausible assumptions and, from there on, the range of plausible conclusions.

500|$|Nostradamus {{claimed to}} base his {{published}} predictions on judicial astrology—the astrological 'judgment', or assessment, of the 'quality' (and thus potential) of {{events such as}} births, weddings, coronations etc.—but was heavily criticised by professional astrologers of the day such as Laurens Videl for incompetence and for assuming that [...] "comparative horoscopy" [...] (the comparison of future planetary configurations with those accompanying known past events) could actually predict <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|E
500|$|Moffat wrote six episodes for the series. The {{rest were}} penned by guest writers, as Moffat {{believed}} that Doctor Who benefited from different voices. However, {{he stated that}} the concepts of the episodes were mostly supplied by him, as he had a [...] "pretty good idea" [...] of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> each episode slot. Moffat knew all of the guest writers [...] "to some degree" [...] and called meeting with them [...] "quite joyous". However, Matthew Graham, co-creator of Life on Mars and writer of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", {{was not able to}} write an episode as he was slated to because he did not believe he would have enough time. Moffat later contacted him and asked him to write a two-part episode for the next series, which became [...] "The Rebel Flesh"/"The Almost People".|$|E

500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through.

2500|$|According to an {{argument}} outlined by Maria Rosa Menocal in The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History, in 11th-century Spain, {{a group of}} wandering poets appeared who would go from court to court, and sometimes travel to Christian courts in southern France, a situation closely mirroring <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> southern France about a century later.

50|$|Aspects {{of novels}} were realistic, which made them {{appealing}} and relatable. The elements of novels {{that made them}} sensational and alluring were the parts that deviated from <b>what</b> <b>would</b> usually <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> reality. Society feared that people, mainly women, {{would not be able}} to differentiate between the realistic and completely fictional elements. Basically the argument against novels was that it would cause people to have unrealistic expectations of life.|$|R

After the match the seemingly hurt Mini Luchadors had to be taken from the ring on stretchers. In the third fall the outcome of the match itself, the team of Guerrero Maya Jr., Rey Cometa and Stuka Jr. defeated Misterioso Jr., Niebla Roja and Puma King, was less important than the actions after the match. Both Rey Cometa and Puma King spoke at length about their problems with each other, finally agreeing to a Luchas de Apuestas [...] "Mask vs. mask" [...] between the two for the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show.

2500|$|In {{the run-up}} to the {{invasion}} of Iraq in 2003, it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS conducted Operation Mass Appeal which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media. The operation was exposed in The Sunday Times in December 2003. Claims by former weapons inspector Scott Ritter suggest that similar propaganda campaigns against Iraq date back well into the 1990s. Ritter says that SIS recruited him in 1997 to help with the propaganda effort. [...] "The aim was to convince the public that Iraq was a far greater threat than it actually was." [...] Towards the end of the invasion, SIS agents operating out of Baghdad international airport with Special Air Service (SAS) protection, began to re-establish a station in Baghdad and began gathering intelligence; in particular on WMDs, after it became clear that Iraq did not possess any WMDs, MI6 had to officially withdraw pre-invasion intelligence about them. In the months after the invasion, they also began gathering political intelligence; predicting <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> post-Baathist Iraq.

If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.|$|E
