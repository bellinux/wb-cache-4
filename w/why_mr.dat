5|$|Kansas Saloon Smashers {{became a}} success upon its March release, and {{inspired}} other films about Nation {{to be produced}} by Lubin Manufacturing Company and Biograph Company. It {{was not the only}} film produced by Edison Studios to mock Nation; released the same year, <b>Why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nation Wants a Divorce parodied the relationship between Nation and her husband. A print of the film is preserved in the Library of Congress, and it was released on DVD in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Kansas Saloon Smashers film {{is now in}} {{the public}} domain, and a paper print is {{preserved}} in the Library of Congress. This paper print was used to recover the film for a 2007 DVD release, as part of the compilation Social Issues in American Film 1900–1934. The compilation, part of the Treasures from American Film Archives produced by the National Film Preservation Foundation, features several films from the period which had particular focus on common issues at their releases. The other Edison-produced Nation film, <b>Why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nation Wants a Divorce, is also included.|$|E

25|$|While not {{commenting on}} {{the reasons for the}} {{charging}} decisions as to any other persons, we can say that the reasons <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Libby was not charged with an offense directly relating to his unauthorized disclosures of classified information regarding Ms. Wilson included, but were not limited to, the fact that Mr. Libby's false testimony obscured a confident determination of what in fact occurred, particularly where the accounts of the reporters with whom Mr. Libby spoke (and their notes) did not include any explicit evidence specifically proving that Mr. Libby knew that Ms. Wilson was a covert agent. On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Dave Kehr {{noted in}} a 2007 The New York Times article that, along with <b>Why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nation Wants a Divorce, the film now seems dated {{due to the fact}} that [...] "the evil {{influence}} of liquor is no longer the burning question it was". Critic Alan Scherstuhl wrote in Village Voice that the film worked as [...] "evidence that the first things our visual mass-media culture sold to its audience were comic licentiousness— and the impulse to clean such filth up." ...|$|E
500|$|Kansas Saloon Smashers {{features}} stop action techniques, used {{to portray}} Nation destroying the bar; it {{was shot in}} black-and-white. [...] A copyright was filed for the film on February 2, 1903. The finished product comprised around 60 to 65 feet (around 18 m) of 35 mm film. Kansas Saloon Smashers {{was not the only}} satire of Nation to be produced by Edison Studios. <b>Why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nation Wants a Divorce, a comedy picture released the same year, was inspired by news articles on Nation's husband requesting a divorce.|$|E

500|$|One critic, Alice Fannin, {{says the}} [...] "loosely plotted" [...] story gives no true {{explanation}} for <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mallard leaves {{the island in}} the Charles River or why the Mallards did not simply stay on the lagoon island {{in the first place}} and avoid the bicyclists on the shore. However, McCloskey has stated himself that he thinks of himself as an artist who writes children's books and not vice versa. Fannin also finds the characterization lacking, that is, the Mallards represent [...] "rather stereotypically concerned parents", often showing the same facial expressions and rarely showing expressiveness.|$|E
500|$|Gerolmo {{described}} his original draft script as [...] "a big, passionate, violent detective story {{set against the}} greatest sea-change in American life in the 20th century, the civil rights movement". For legal reasons, {{the names of the}} people and certain details related to the FBI's investigation were changed. On presenting Clinton Pell's wife as an informant, Gerolmo said, [...] "...the fact that no one knew who Mr. X, the informant, was, left that as a dramatic possibility for me, in my Hollywood movie version of the story. That's <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> X became the wife of one of the conspirators." [...] The abductor of Mayor Tilman was originally written as a Mafia hitman who forces a confession by putting a pistol in Tillman's mouth. Gerolmo was inspired by Gregory Scarpa, a mob enforcer recruited by the FBI during their search for Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner.|$|E
500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|On the Kahana, Desmond and Sayid {{are still}} waiting {{to speak to the}} captain of the freighter, Gault (Grant Bowler). When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps {{off the side of the}} ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that [...] Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to make everybody believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying that is one of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus [...] and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) working as a deckhand under the alias [...] "Kevin Johnson".|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E

2500|$|After this ruling, {{there were}} serious {{questions}} raised as to <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Haradinaj was ever indicted {{in the first}} place. Indeed, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Madonald of River Glaven QC, said yesterday: [...] "This prosecution was a stupid attempt to equate resistance with aggression. It was an embarrassment to the international community." [...] The governments of both Albania and Kosovo have demanded a public inquiry into {{the behavior of the}} Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte over her conduct to bring this indictment forward.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 2017, Graham Spanier, Gary Schultz and Timothy Curley {{were sentenced}} to prison by Senior Judge John Boccabella. [...] "Why no one made {{a phone call to}} the police...is beyond me. <b>Why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sandusky was allowed to {{continue}} to use the Penn State facilities is beyond me," [...] Boccabella said. Spanier was sentenced to 4 to 12 months with 2 months in jail and 4 months house arrest, followed by 2 years of probation and a $7,500 fine. Curley was sentenced to a 7 to 23 month jail term, with 4 months of it as house arrest, followed by 2 years of probation and a $5,000 fine. Schultz was sentenced to a 6 to 23 month jail term also with 4 months of it as house arrest, followed by 2 years of probation and a $5,000 fine.|$|E
2500|$|In the October 7, 2006 {{debate in}} Memphis, the {{candidates}} covered {{a wide range}} of issues, including immigration, Iraq, cutting health care costs, abortion, and Social Security.

[...] Ford responded, [...] "I don't know <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Corker keeps bringing up my family[...] [...] [...] It's you and I running for the Senate. It's our ideas, our plans to make the future better for everybody. Let's stick to you and I. And if you come up with a recipe to pick family, say it.

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me <b>why</b> <b>Mr.</b> Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
