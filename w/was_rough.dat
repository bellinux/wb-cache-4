5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea <b>was</b> <b>rough,</b> and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{enlisted men}} were leery {{of working with}} deadly {{explosives}} but were told by officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs and shells, involved using levers and crowbars from boxcars, {{in which they were}} packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering the bundle into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand a short distance into place. This series of actions <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} {{probable}} {{reasons for the}} deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank {{if they were not}} dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.|$|E

30|$|An {{extension}} of Persson’s model of contact mechanics {{was used to}} study the contact area and the interfacial separation, when the elastic solid and the hard substrate <b>are</b> both <b>rough.</b> It <b>was</b> seen that when the two surfaces <b>are</b> <b>rough</b> but uncorrelated, the real contact decreases compared to the case where only the substrate <b>is</b> <b>rough,</b> effectively the roughness has been increased.|$|R
5|$|Although {{considered}} an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no.1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested {{transfer to the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No.9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In {{the first week of}} December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman Longhorn after standing duty all night, and his touchdown <b>was</b> <b>rough.</b> When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E

25|$|Several Oregon Trail {{branches}} and route variations {{led to the}} Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved though the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.|$|E
25|$|Until the Industrial Revolution, soapmaking was {{conducted}} {{on a small scale}} and the product <b>was</b> <b>rough.</b> In 1780 James Keir established a chemical works at Tipton, for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of potash and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. Andrew Pears started making a high-quality, transparent soap in 1807 in London. His son-in-law, Thomas J. Barratt, opened a factory in Isleworth in 1862.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{he began}} to try his hand at air racing, {{starting}} with the national air races in Los Angeles. In 1938 he flew, for the first time, a Keith Rider racer dubbed The Firecracker, owned by air racing enthusiast Bill Schoenfeldt. In this plane, he won the Greve Trophy in Cleveland that year. His landing after that flight <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> and damaged the aircraft too heavily {{to allow him to}} compete for the Thompson Trophy the next day. A year later, he was back in Cleveland, and this time placed second in the Thompson race.|$|E

25|$|Sold {{together}} with 41141 by L'Ebe Bugatti in the Summer of 1950 to American Le Mans racer Briggs Cunningham, {{in return for}} FR₣200,000, ($571 US) plus a pair of new General Electric refrigerators, then unavailable in post-war France. Bear {{in mind that the}} French franc had been drastically devalued in the years immediately following the war. The refrigerators were included out of gratuity. The car <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> but drive-able. Taking the refrigerators into account, he essentially paid about $600 per car. Restoration costs would bring the total cost up to about 1 million Francs, or $2,858 US, per car. The cars were delivered to the US in January 1951.|$|E
25|$|The Polish forces {{grew from}} {{approximately}} 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920. By 20 August 1920, the Polish army {{had reached a}} strength of 737,767, so there <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> numerical parity between the Polish army and the opposing Soviet forces. Polish intelligence knew the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive; the Polish High Command decided to launch a preemptive attack. The plan for Operation Kiev was more ambitious than simply defeating the Red Army on Poland's southern flank. It aimed at creating a friendly government within the captured Ukrainian territories. Afterwards, Piłsudski and his Polish General Staff planned to reassign the 3rd Army to the north, where Polish planners expected a major Red Army counteroffensive.|$|E
25|$|The Polish Army {{was made}} up of {{soldiers}} who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers, such as the Kościuszko Squadron. Boris Savinkov was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920. In August 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 soldiers; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> numerical parity between the two armies; and {{by the time of the}} battle of Warsaw, the Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.|$|E

25|$|One {{of those}} basket weavers is Julia F. Parker. She {{is a master}} weaver, having woven under Lucy Telles. Her {{childhood}} <b>was</b> <b>rough,</b> constantly moving around until boarding school after her parents’ death at 6. Lucy had taught Julia because of her perceived interest in preserving Indian culture and specifically basketry. Julia Parker became cultural demonstrator after Lucy Telles death in 1956. She continued in her studies and later studied Pomo basketry with Pomo master weaver Elsie Allen (1899–1990) at Ukiah and several others. Julia belongs to the Miwok Pomo and Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. Many of her baskets are in museums in Yosemite, Mono Lake and other museums; she even presented her baskets to the Queen of England.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the naval}} {{support for the}} LCAs {{approaching}} Bark South were LCS(M)s to provide supporting fire during their approach to the beaches. The naval plan worked adequately, with few exceptions, {{and there was no}} enemy air or sea interdiction. The Mediterranean <b>was</b> <b>rough,</b> however, and most of troops travelling in LCAs suffered sea-sickness, one man so much so that he died. Some worry plagued planners regarding LCAs swamping in the heavy surf at the shoreline, but the crews touched down and retracted their craft without serious difficulty. Anxious minutes passed at the Red and Green waiting positions, as by zero hour, when the assault wave of LCAs had beached, many of the LCIs and most of the LCTs had not arrived. This was largely due to the rough sea which, though inconvenient for landing ships carrying LCAs, had considerably reduced the distances landing craft could cover.|$|E
25|$|Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, {{and sailors}} {{would be a}} huge {{business}} and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment. Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments. They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and deadfalls which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical reed organs which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of cabaret which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor. The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured can-can dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar <b>was</b> <b>rough</b> boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.|$|E
