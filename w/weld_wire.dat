40|$|The welding of {{aluminum}}-clad fuel plates into {{aluminum alloy}} 6061 side plate tubing {{is a unique}} design feature of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) fuel assemblies as 101 full-penetration circumferential gas metal arc welds (GMAW) are required in the fabrication of each assembly. In a HFIR fuel assembly, 540 aluminum-clad fuel plates are assembled into two nested annular fuel elements 610 mm (24 -inches) long. The welding process for the HFIR fuel elements {{was developed in the}} early 1960 s and about 450 HFIR fuel assemblies have been successfully welded using the GMAW process qualified in the 1960 s. In recent years because of the degradation of the electronic and mechanical components in the old HFIR welding system, reportable defects in plate attachment or adapter welds have been present in almost all completed fuel assemblies. In October 2008, a contract was awarded to AMET, Inc., of Rexburg, Idaho, to replace the old welding equipment with standard commercially available welding components to the maximum extent possible while maintaining the qualified HFIR welding process. The upgraded HFIR welding system represents a major improvement in the welding system used in welding HFIR fuel elements for the previous 40 years. In this upgrade, the new inner GMAW torch is a significant advancement over the original inner GMAW torch previously used.

40|$|Welding {{of heavy}} section steel has {{traditionally}} used the automatic {{submerged arc welding}} (ASAW) process {{because of the high}} deposition rates achievable. However, the properties, particularly fracture toughness, of the weld are often inferior when compared to base material. This project evaluated the use of narrow groove gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to improve weld material properties. The welding procedures were developed for ASTM A 508 Class 4 base material using a 1 % Ni filler material complying to AWS Specification A. 23 - 90 -EF 3 -F 3 -N.

The focus of the present work is to determine the effect of macrostructure, microstructure, and the size, distribution and chemical composition of the non-metallic inclusions on the strength and impact toughness of multipass Gas Metal Arc (GMA) and Gas Tungsten Arc (GTA) welds. Eight sample multipass GMA and GTA weldments using ULCB <b>weld</b> <b>wire</b> were studied by optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The microstructures of the weld metals were dominantly bainitic except for the recrystallized regions of the GTA welds which had become ferritic. The macrostructure of the GMA weldments was dominated by columnar grains. SEM and optical fractography suggested that this macrostructure is responsible for the corresponding poor toughness in these weldments. In all weldments the non-metallic inclusions were found to be very small (on average % 0. 5 microns) with a somewhat higher volume fraction in the GMA vice GTA weldments. Based on previous work, the small average size of these inclusions are surmised to have had very little effect on toughness[URL] United States Nav...|$|E

It was found that increasing oxygen content of the weld metal (due to increased oxygen in the shielding gas) led to increased non-metallic inclusion size and volume fraction; which in turn, led to both decreasing strength and toughness. The strength was lowered because increasing oxygen in the shielding gas led to increased 'consumption' of strengthening alloys such as carbon, manganese and silicon.

40|$|The {{nature of}} weld metal {{inclusions}} {{in relation to}} the formation of acicular ferrite was investigated. Gas-metal arc welds (GMAW) on High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) plate with varying amounts of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide added to the argon cover gas and submerged arc welds (SAW) on HY- 100 plate with five different fluxes were analyzed. This analysis determined the effect of weld metal composition on non-metallic inclusion composition and the ultimate effects on the formation of acicular ferrite. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis were used to determine inclusion size distribution, concentration and composition. This investigation revealed that the inclusions were complex MnO-A 1203 -SiO 2 -TiO 2 oxides which contain a titanium-rich compound, Pyrophanite (MnTi 03), existing as a faceted particle in those inclusions promoting acicular ferrite formation.
