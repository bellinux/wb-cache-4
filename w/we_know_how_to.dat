500|$|Although the British Hurricane {{device was}} more {{advanced}} than the American Fat Man bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology, and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British, the United States Congress saw little benefit {{in it for the}} United States. The McMahon Act was amended by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations, on 30 August 1954, but it fell far short of what the British government wanted. Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister, turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that [...] "We think <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make an H-bomb", but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're {{not used to}} hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already {{know how to play}} our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. But if we can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet until <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> love the people that are around us".|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it inexpensively, so can you get one into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year {{at the beginning of the}} episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
2500|$|Section G also {{contains}} Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that [...] "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It {{can do whatever}} <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." [...] This objection {{has been the subject}} of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper [...] "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".|$|E

2500|$|Each episode {{ended with}} an {{extended}} instrumental performance of [...] "The Muppet Show Theme" [...] by the Muppet orchestra before Statler and Waldorf gave {{the last laugh}} of the night. Some last laugh sequences featured other Muppets on the balcony. For example, in one episode, the Muppets of Sesame Street appeared behind the duo who told them: [...] "How should <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get to Sesame Street? We don't {{even know how to}} get out of this stupid theater box!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The band flew to New York {{to record}} their debut eponymous album, Baby Animals, at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and Second City Studio, Long Island with ex-pat Australian Mike Chapman producing. DeMarchi said of the {{production}} process: [...] "It was great. Basically, Mike left us alone to {{make the kind of}} music <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make; and whenever he did have a suggestion, it was always something that made the sound better. So what you hear is pure recording, the band as it really is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Rizal Monument {{now stands}} near {{the place where}} he fell at the Luneta in Bagumbayan, which is now called Rizal Park, a {{national}} park in Manila. The monument, which also contains his remains, was designed by the Swiss Richard Kissling of the William Tell sculpture in Altdorf, Uri. The monument carries the inscription: [...] "I want to show to those who deprive people the right to love of country, that when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice ourselves for our duties and convictions, death does not matter if one dies for those one loves – for his country and for others dear to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{stated that}} the {{decision}} to have a child should be a medical matter, and that oversight of population and genetics must be kept in the realm of science, outside of politicians' control: [...] "If genetics {{is in the hands of}} Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, what will be the fate of the world?" [...] He believed that in the right hands, these measures could be used for good: [...] "Once <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> change the program, thousands of possibilities open up. We can give every man and woman the best of everything. There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily. Being retarded, crippled, blind, ugly – all these will be possible to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Supporters {{see in the}} {{retraction}} Rizal's [...] "moral courage...to {{recognize his}} mistakes," [...] his reversion to the [...] "true faith", and thus his [...] "unfading glory," [...] {{and a return to}} the [...] "ideals of his fathers" [...] which [...] "did not diminish his stature as a great patriot; on the contrary, it increased that stature to greatness." [...] On the other hand, senator Jose Diokno stated, [...] "Surely whether Rizal died as a Catholic or an apostate adds or detracts nothing from his greatness as a Filipino... Catholic or Mason, Rizal is still Rizal – the hero who courted death 'to prove to those who deny our patriotism that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> die for our duty and our beliefs'." ...|$|E

2500|$|On one [...] "alternative" [...] {{there is}} no disagreement: Fisher himself said, [...] "In {{relation}} to the test of significance, we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> conduct an experiment which will rarely fail {{to give us a}} statistically significant result." [...] Cohen, an influential critic of significance testing, concurred, [...] "... don't look for a magic alternative to NHST ... It doesn't exist." [...] "... given the problems of statistical induction, we must finally rely, as have the older sciences, on replication." [...] The [...] "alternative" [...] to significance testing is repeated testing. The easiest way to decrease statistical uncertainty is by obtaining more data, whether by increased sample size or by repeated tests. Nickerson claimed to have never seen the publication of a literally replicated experiment in psychology. An indirect approach to replication is meta-analysis.|$|E
