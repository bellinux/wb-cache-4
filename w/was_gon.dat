[...] Therefore as those young Prophets then with care [...] Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these [...] Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico [...] 20 [...] The City of Palms, Aenon, and Salem Old, [...] Machaerus and each Town or City wall'd [...] On this side the broad lake Genezaret [...] Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. [...] Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: [...] Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play [...] Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, [...] Close in a Cottage low together got [...] Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. [...] Alas from what high hope to what relapse [...] 30 [...] Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld [...] Messiah certainly now come, so long [...] Expected of our Fathers; we have heard [...] His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, [...] Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, [...] The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: [...] Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd [...] Into perplexity and new amaze: [...] For whither is he gone, what accident [...] Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire [...] 40 [...] After appearance, and again prolong [...] Our expectation? God of Israel, [...] Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; [...] Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress [...] Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust [...] They have exalted, and behind them cast [...] All fear of thee, arise and vindicate [...] Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, [...] But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, [...] Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, [...] 50 [...] By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, [...] In publick, and with him we have convers'd; [...] Let us be glad of this, and all our fears [...] Lay on his Providence; he will not fail [...] Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, [...] Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, [...] Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return.

[...] O what avails me now that honour high [...] To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute [...] Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; [...] While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, [...] And fears as eminent, above the lot [...] 70 [...] Of other women, by the birth I bore, [...] In such a season born when scarce a Shed [...] Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me [...] From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, [...] A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye [...] Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King [...] Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd [...] With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; [...] From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth [...] Hath been our dwelling many years, his life [...] 80 [...] Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, [...] Little suspicious to any King; but now [...] Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, [...] By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, [...] Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; [...] I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, [...] But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold, [...] That to the fall and rising he should be [...] Of Many in Israel, and to a sign [...] Spoken against, that through my very Soul [...] 90 [...] A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, [...] My Exaltation to Afflictions high; [...] Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; [...] I will not argue that, nor will repine. [...] But where delays he now? some great intent [...] Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, [...] I lost him, but so found, as well I saw [...] He could not lose himself; but went about [...] His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, [...] Since understand; much more his absence now [...] 100 [...] Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.

[...] Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence [...] 140 [...] Of my success with Eve in Paradise [...] Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure [...] Of like succeeding here; I summon all [...] Rather to be in readiness, with hand [...] Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst [...] Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd.

[...] Set women in his eye and in his walk, [...] Among daughters of men the fairest found; [...] Many are in each Region passing fair [...] As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses [...] Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, [...] Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues [...] Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild [...] And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, [...] 160 [...] Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw [...] Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. [...] Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame [...] Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, [...] Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, [...] Draw out with credulous desire, and lead [...] At will the manliest, resolutest brest, [...] As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. [...] Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart [...] Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, [...] 170 [...] And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. [...] To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd [...] Belial in much uneven scale thou weigh'st [...] All others by thy self; because of old [...] Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring [...] Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, [...] None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. [...] Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, [...] False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth [...] Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, [...] 180 [...] And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. [...] Have we not seen, or by relation heard, [...] In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, [...] In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, [...] In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay [...] Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, [...] Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, [...] Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more [...] Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, [...] Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, [...] 190 [...] Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan? But these haunts [...] Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, [...] How many have with a smile made small account [...] Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd [...] All her assaults, on worthier things intent? [...] Remember that Pellean Conquerour, [...] A youth, how all the Beauties of the East [...] He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; [...] How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd [...] In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. [...] 200 [...] For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full [...] Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond [...] Higher design then to enjoy his State; [...] Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; [...] But he whom we attempt is wiser far [...] Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, [...] Made and set wholly on the accomplishment [...] Of greatest things; what woman will you find, [...] Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, [...] On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye [...] 210 [...] Of fond desire? or should she confident, [...] As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, [...] Descend with all her winning charms begirt [...] To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once [...] Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; [...] How would one look from his Majestick brow [...] Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, [...] Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout [...] All her array; her female pride deject, [...] Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands [...] 220 [...] In the admiration only of weak minds [...] Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Flumes [...] Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, [...] At every sudden slighting quite abasht: [...] Therefore with manlier objects we must try [...] His constancy, with such as have more shew [...] Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; [...] Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; [...] Or that which only seems to satisfie [...] Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; [...] 230 [...] And now I know he hungers where no food [...] Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; [...] The rest commit to me, I shall let pass [...] No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. [...] He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; [...] Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band [...] Of Spirits likest to himself in guile [...] To be at hand, and at his beck appear, [...] If cause were to unfold some active Scene [...] Of various persons each to know his part; [...] 240 [...] Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; [...] Where still from shade to shade the Son of God [...] After forty days fasting had remain'd, [...] Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. [...] Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd [...] Wandring this woody maze, and humane food [...] Nor tasted, nor had appetite: that Fast [...] To Vertue I impute not, or count part [...] Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, [...] Or God support Nature without repast [...] 250 [...] Though needing, what praise is it to endure? [...] But now I feel I hunger, which declares, [...] Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God [...] Can satisfie that need some other way, [...] Though hunger still remain: so it remain [...] Without this bodies wasting, I content me, [...] And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, [...] Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed [...] Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. [...] It was the hour of night, when thus the Son [...] 260 [...] Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down [...] Under the hospitable covert nigh [...] Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, [...] And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, [...] Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; [...] Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood [...] And saw the Ravens with thir horny beaks [...] Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, [...] Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: [...] He saw the Prophet also how he fled [...] 270 [...] Into the Desert, and how there he slept [...] Under a Juniper; then how awakt, [...] He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, [...] And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, [...] And eat the second time after repose, [...] The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; [...] Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, [...] Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. [...] Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark [...] Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry [...] 280 [...] The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: [...] As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose [...] Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, [...] Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. [...] Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, [...] From whose high top to ken the prospect round, [...] If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; [...] But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, [...] Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, [...] With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; [...] 290 [...] Thither he bent his way, determin'd there [...] To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade [...] High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown [...] That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, [...] Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) [...] And to a Superstitious eye the haunt [...] Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, [...] When suddenly a man before him stood, [...] Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, [...] As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, [...] 300 [...] And with fair speech these words to him address'd. [...] With granted leave officious I return, [...] But much more wonder that the Son of God [...] In this wild solitude so long should bide [...] Of all things destitute, and well I know, [...] Not without hunger. Others of some note, [...] As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; [...] The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son [...] Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief [...] By a providing Angel; all the race [...] 310 [...] Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God [...] Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold [...] Native of Thebes wandring here was fed [...] Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. [...] Of thee these forty days none hath regard, [...] Forty and more deserted here indeed. [...] To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? [...] They all had need, I as thou seest have none. [...] How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, [...] Tell me if Food were now before thee set, [...] 320 [...] Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like [...] The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that [...] Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, [...] Hast thou not right to all Created things, [...] Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee [...] Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, [...] But tender all their power? nor mention I [...] Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first [...] To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; [...] Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who [...] 330 [...] Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold [...] Nature asham'd, or better to express, [...] Troubl'd that thou should'st hunger, hath purvey'd [...] From all the Elements her choicest store [...] To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord [...] With honour, only deign to sit and eat. [...] He spake no dream, for as his words had end, [...] Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld [...] In ample space under the broadest shade [...] A Table richly spred, in regal mode, [...] 340 [...] With dishes pil'd, and meats of noblest sort [...] And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, [...] In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, [...] Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, [...] Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, [...] And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd [...] Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. [...] Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, [...] Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! [...] And at a stately side-board by the wine [...] 350 [...] That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood [...] Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew [...] Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more [...] Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood [...] Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades [...] With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, [...] And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd [...] Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since [...] Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide [...] By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, [...] 360 [...] Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, [...] And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard [...] Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds [...] Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd [...] From their soft wings, and flora's earliest smells. [...] Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now [...] His invitation earnestly renew'd. [...] What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? [...] These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict [...] Defends the touching of these viands pure, [...] 370 [...] Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, [...] But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, [...] Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. [...] All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, [...] Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay [...] Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: [...] What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. [...] To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: [...] Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? [...] And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? [...] 380 [...] Shall I receive by gift what of my own, [...] When and where likes me best, I can command? [...] I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, [...] Command a Table in this Wilderness, [...] And call swift flights of Angels ministrant [...] Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: [...] Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, [...] In vain, where no acceptance it can find, [...] And with my hunger what hast thou to do? [...] Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, [...] 390 [...] And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. [...] To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: [...] That I have also power to give thou seest, [...] If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary [...] What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd. [...] And rather opportunely in this place [...] Chose to impart to thy apparent need, [...] Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see [...] What I can do or offer is suspect; [...] Of these things others quickly will dispose [...] 400 [...] Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that [...] Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite [...] With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; [...] Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, [...] And with these words his temptation pursu'd. [...] By hunger, that each other Creature tames, [...] Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; [...] Thy temperance invincible besides, [...] For no allurement yields to appetite, [...] And all thy heart is set on high designs, [...] 410 [...] High actions: but wherewith to be atchiev'd? [...] Great acts require great means of enterprise, [...] Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, [...] A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self [...] Bred up in poverty and streights at home; [...] Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: [...] Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire [...] To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, [...] What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, [...] Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, [...] 420 [...] Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? [...] Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; [...] What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, [...] And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; [...] (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? [...] Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, [...] Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, [...] Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, [...] Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; [...] They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, [...] 430 [...] While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. [...] To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; [...] Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, [...] To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. [...] Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, [...] In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: [...] But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd [...] In lowest poverty to highest deeds; [...] Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, [...] Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat [...] 440 [...] So many Ages, and shall yet regain [...] That seat, and reign in Israel without end. [...] Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World [...] To me is not unknown what hath been done [...] Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember [...] Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? [...] For I esteem those names of men so poor [...] Who could do mighty things, and could contemn [...] Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. [...] And what in me seems wanting, but that I [...] 450 [...] May also in this poverty as soon [...] Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? [...] Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools [...] The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt [...] To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, [...] Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. [...] What if with like aversion I reject [...] Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, [...] Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, [...] Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights [...] 460 [...] To him who wears the Regal Diadem, [...] When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; [...] For therein stands the office of a King, [...] His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, [...] That for the Publick all this weight he bears. [...] Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules [...] Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; [...] Which every wise and vertuous man attains: [...] And who attains not, ill aspires to rule [...] Cities of men, or head-strong Multitudes, [...] 470 [...] Subject himself to Anarchy within, [...] Or lawless passions in him which he serves. [...] But to guide Nations in the way of truth [...] By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead [...] To know, and knowing worship God aright, [...] Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, [...] Governs the inner man, the nobler part, [...] That other o're the body only reigns, [...] And oft by force, which to a generous mind [...] So reigning can be no sincere delight. [...] 480 [...] Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought [...] Greater and nobler done, and to lay down [...] Far more magnanimous, then to assume. [...] Riches are needless then, both for themselves, [...] And for thy reason why they should be sought, [...] To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.|$|E

[...] I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; [...] To find thee I directed then my walk; [...] And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways [...] 50 [...] That brought me on a sudden to the Tree [...] Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, [...] Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: [...] And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood [...] One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n [...] By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd [...] Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; [...] And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, [...] Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, [...] Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? [...] 60 [...] Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? [...] Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold [...] Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? [...] This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme [...] He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd [...] At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: [...] But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, [...] Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, [...] Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit [...] For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: [...] 70 [...] And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more [...] Communicated, more abundant growes, [...] The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? [...] Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve, [...] Partake thou also; happie though thou art, [...] Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: [...] Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods [...] Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, [...] But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes [...] Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see [...] 80 [...] What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. [...] So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, [...] Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part [...] Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell [...] So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, [...] Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds [...] With him I flew, and underneath beheld [...] The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide [...] And various: wondring at my flight and change [...] To this high exaltation; suddenly [...] 90 [...] My Guide <b>was</b> <b>gon,</b> and I, me thought, sunk down, [...] And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd [...] To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night [...] Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. [...] Best Image of my self and dearer half, [...] The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep [...] Affects me equally; nor can I like [...] This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; [...] Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, [...] Created pure. But know that in the Soule [...] 100 [...] Are many lesser Faculties that serve [...] Reason as chief; among these Fansie next [...] Her office holds; of all external things, [...] Which the five watchful Senses represent, [...] She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, [...] Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames [...] All what we affirm or what deny, and call [...] Our knowledge or opinion; then retires [...] Into her private Cell when Nature rests. [...] Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes [...] 110 [...] To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, [...] Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, [...] Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. [...] Som such resemblances methinks I find [...] Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, [...] But with addition strange; yet be not sad. [...] Evil into the mind of God or Man [...] May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave [...] No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope [...] That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, [...] 120 [...] Waking thou never wilt consent to do. [...] Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks [...] That wont to be more chearful and serene [...] Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, [...] And let us to our fresh imployments rise [...] Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours [...] That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells [...] Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. [...] So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, [...] But silently a gentle tear let fall [...] 130 [...] From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; [...] Two other precious drops that ready stood, [...] Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell [...] Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse [...] And pious awe, that feard to have offended. [...] So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. [...] But first from under shadie arborous roof, [...] Soon as they forth were come to open sight [...] Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen [...] With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, [...] 140 [...] Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, [...] Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East [...] Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains, [...] Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began [...] Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid [...] In various style, for neither various style [...] Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise [...] Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung [...] Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence [...] Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, [...] 150 [...] More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp [...] To add more sweetness, and they thus began. [...] These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, [...] Almightie, thine this universal Frame, [...] Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! [...] Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens [...] To us invisible or dimly seen [...] In these thy lowest works, yet these declare [...] Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: [...] Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, [...] 160 [...] Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs [...] And choral symphonies, Day without Night, [...] Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, [...] On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll [...] Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. [...] Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, [...] If better thou belong not to the dawn, [...] Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn [...] With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare [...] While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. [...] 170 [...] Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, [...] Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise [...] In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, [...] And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. [...] Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st [...] With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, [...] And yee five other wandring Fires that move [...] In mystic Dance not without Song, resound [...] His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. [...] Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth [...] 180 [...] Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run [...] Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix [...] And nourish all things, let your ceasless change [...] Varie to our great Maker still new praise. [...] Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise [...] From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, [...] Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, [...] In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, [...] Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, [...] Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, [...] 190 [...] Rising or falling still advance his praise. [...] His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, [...] Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, [...] With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. [...] Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, [...] Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. [...] Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, [...] That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, [...] Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; [...] Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk [...] 200 [...] The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; [...] Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, [...] To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade [...] Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. [...] Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still [...] To give us onely good; and if the night [...] Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, [...] Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. [...] So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts [...] Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. [...] 210 [...] On to thir mornings rural work they haste [...] Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row [...] Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr [...] Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check [...] Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine [...] To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines [...] Her mariageable arms, and with her brings [...] Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn [...] His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld [...] With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd [...] 220 [...] Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd [...] To travel with Tobias, and secur'd [...] His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. [...] Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth [...] Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf [...] Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd [...] This night the human pair, how he designes [...] In them at once to ruin all mankind. [...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, [...] Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly [...] These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth [...] Impendent, raging into sudden flame [...] Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel [...] His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. [...] 890 [...] Then who created thee lamenting learne, [...] When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. [...] So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, [...] Among the faithless, faithful only hee; [...] Among innumerable false, unmov'd, [...] Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd [...] His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; [...] Nor number, nor example with him wrought [...] To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind [...] Though single. From amidst them forth he passd, [...] 900 [...] Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind [...] Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught; [...] And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd [...] On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.|$|E

[...] Him after long debate, irresolute [...] Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose [...] Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom [...] To enter, and his dark suggestions hide [...] 90 [...] From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, [...] Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, [...] As from his wit and native suttletie [...] Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd [...] Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r [...] Active within beyond the sense of brute. [...] Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe [...] His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: [...] O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd [...] More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built [...] 100 [...] With second thoughts, reforming what was old! [...] For what God after better worse would build? [...] Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns [...] That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, [...] Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, [...] In thee concentring all thir precious beams [...] Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n [...] Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou [...] Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, [...] Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers [...] 110 [...] Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth [...] Of Creatures animate with gradual life [...] Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man. [...] With what delight could I have walkt thee round [...] If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange [...] Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, [...] Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd, [...] Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these [...] Find place or refuge; and the more I see [...] Pleasures about me, so much more I feel [...] 120 [...] Torment within me, as from the hateful siege [...] Of contraries; all good to me becomes [...] Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state. [...] But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n [...] To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame; [...] Nor hope to be my self less miserable [...] By what I seek, but others to make such [...] As I though thereby worse to me redound: [...] For onely in destroying I finde ease [...] To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, [...] 130 [...] Or won to what may work his utter loss, [...] For whom all this was made, all this will soon [...] Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, [...] In wo then; that destruction wide may range: [...] To mee shall be the glorie sole among [...] The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd [...] What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days [...] Continu'd making, and who knows how long [...] Before had bin contriving, though perhaps [...] Not longer then since I in one Night freed [...] 140 [...] From servitude inglorious welnigh half [...] Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng [...] Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, [...] And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd, [...] Whether such vertue spent of old now faild [...] More Angels to Create, if they at least [...] Are his Created or to spite us more, [...] Determin'd to advance into our room [...] A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow, [...] Exalted from so base original, [...] 150 [...] With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed [...] He effected; Man he made, and for him built [...] Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, [...] Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!

Revenge, at first though sweet, [...] Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; [...] Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd, [...] Since higher I fall short, on him who next [...] Provokes my envie, this new Favorite [...] Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, [...] Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd [...] From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. [...] So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, [...] Like a black mist low creeping, he held on [...] 180 [...] His midnight search, where soonest he might finde [...] The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found [...] In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd, [...] His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: [...] Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, [...] Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe [...] Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth [...] The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, [...] In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd [...] With act intelligential; but his sleep [...] 190 [...] Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn. [...] Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne [...] In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd [...] Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, [...] From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise [...] To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill [...] With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair [...] And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire [...] Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake [...] The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: [...] 200 [...] Then commune how that day they best may ply [...] Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew [...] The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. [...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.

[...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.
