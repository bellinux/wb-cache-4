5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual <b>working</b> <b>that</b> a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E

25|$|As {{a further}} measure to prevent escapes, the patrol {{patterns}} of the Grenztruppen were carefully arranged to reduce any chance of a border guard defecting. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three soldiers at a time. They {{were not allowed to}} go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. When changing the guard in watchtowers, they were under orders to enter and exit the buildings {{in such a way that}} there were never fewer than two people on the ground. Duty rosters were organised to prevent friends and roommates being assigned to the same patrols. The pairings were switched (though not randomly) to ensure that the same people did not repeatedly carry out duty together. Individual border guards did not know until the start of their shift with whom they would be <b>working</b> <b>that</b> day. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, S.D. Castle and Henry House became {{interested}} in the picking of furs. Buffalo hides were getting scarce, and Castle wanted to use muskrat or beaver, but he found the pelts had to be picked of the outer long hair, a tedious job for an unskilled hand. After a few months, House had a small machine <b>working</b> <b>that</b> would pick large or small pelts without missing a hair. The machine-picked skins were shown to furriers in New York. A few days later, a Mr. Frasure of Wall Street, New York, called on House at Bridgeport, and the two reached an agreement for House to develop a machine that would pick a bull pelt six feet long and three feet wide, while being kept moist and warm. This patent, also the first of its kind, for treating pelts, was issued on October 19, 1882 just one month and five days after the application was made.|$|E

And somehow, in <b>working</b> <b>that</b> episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did.

500|$|Through common friends Cameron met Sheridan [...] "Sherry" [...] Kimmel, {{and the two}} {{entered a}} relationship. A veteran of the Second World War from Florida, Kimmel {{suffered}} from posttraumatic stress disorder, often causing him severe mood swings. He developed an interest in occultism and became intensely jealous of Parsons' continuing influence over Cameron, destroying Parsons' notes on the Babalon <b>Working</b> <b>that</b> she had kept. Cameron again became pregnant, although was unsure who the father was; {{she gave birth to}} a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel, on Christmas Eve 1955. She allowed her daughter to behave how she pleased, believing that that was the best way for to learn. With her friend, the film-maker Curtis Harrington, Cameron then produced a short film, The Wormwood Star, which was filmed at the home of multi-millionaire art collector Edward James; the film features images of Cameron's paintings, and recitations of her poems.|$|E
500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of <b>working</b> <b>that</b> was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was while}} Kent was {{away at a}} wedding {{in the country that}} the first reports of strange noises began.

[...] Kent asked Elizabeth to stay with Fanny, who was then several months into a pregnancy, and to share her bed while he was away. [...] The two reported hearing scratching and rapping noises. [...] These were attributed by Mrs Parsons to a neighbouring cobbler, although when the noises re-occurred on a Sunday, Fanny asked if the cobbler was <b>working</b> <b>that</b> day; Mrs Parsons told her he was not. [...] James Franzen, landlord of the nearby Wheat Sheaf public house, was another witness. [...] After visiting the house he reported seeing a ghostly white figure ascend the stairs.

In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run, representing societies that have [...] "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people". The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like The Manchurian Candidate, as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon [...] "Would you kindly" [...] after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as [...] "Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?", later <b>working</b> <b>that</b> phrase into the first script for the game.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, {{in a review}} of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer, called the episode [...] "just plain bad". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

[...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to <b>working</b> <b>that</b> it’s frustrating to see just how little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the good old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode.

500|$|Musically, Title {{comprises}} throwback style sound, 1950s doo wop-inspired {{songs that}} straddle {{the line between}} modern R and melodic pop. The EP's opening track, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop song {{which serves as a}} throwback to 1950s and 1960s music, and contains elements from a complex mix of several genres; R, hip hop, tropical, country and rock and roll. Sonically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] comprises an earworm hook, early 1960s soul-pop groove, scatting tempo and shimmying melody. Lyrically, [...] "All About That Bass" [...] serves as a callout to embrace one's appearance and promote a positive body image. The song metaphorically refers to the appearance of a woman's bottom. Larger women are described as [...] "bass" [...] and thinner women as [...] "treble", which Trainor implies as a joke about [...] "thick and thin". The lyric [...] "I'm bringing booty back" [...] references Justin Timberlake's [...] "SexyBack" [...] (2006).
