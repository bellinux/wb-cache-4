This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that could go wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should {{not be able to}} leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up." [...] Woodlee agreed: [...] "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn't read right. Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to bring something back in a slightly different form".|$|E

[...] Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show, calling it an [...] "inefficient...collection of sprawling narrative ideas" [...] and comparing it to [...] " [...] suddenly turn into Darker than Black." [...] Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose [...] "seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica." [...] Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but [...] "disappoints as a work of art." [...] Early on, Ekens described the series as having [...] "sharp comedic timing," [...] and by episode four, she praised the comedic elements as [...] "already much funnier than Plastic Memories." [...] She {{went on to say}} that [...] "it's dumb, but I like it for the same reasons I liked the comedy in [...]" [...] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte unpredictability [...] "engaging" [...] and its animation [...] "beautiful". Ekens praised P.A. Works for their dynamic direction and [...] "expressive cinematography" [...] which offers [...] "a distinct, pleasant aesthetic." ...|$|E

2500|$|But {{despite all}} the fanfare {{surrounding}} the big-money contract the Nets gave Borg {{and the presence of}} one of the world's top male players on the team, Nets owner Joe Zingale found a way to shine the spotlight even brighter on his team when he signed transsexual Renée Richards to a contract on June 2. At the press conference announcing her signing, Richards said, [...] "I am thankful that I'm being given the opportunity to play professional tennis at the level that I have tried to play, but which has been met with so much frustration that I have been unable to do." [...] When he was asked about whether WTT had approved Richards as a female player, Zingale said, [...] "I didn't ask them. That's not the way I work. There's a lot of politics involved <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to get approval from everybody for such a move." [...] At the time of the signing, Richards was embroiled in litigation with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which had denied her entry into the United States Open Tennis Championships as a female player, because she refused to take the Barr body test of her chromosomes as required by USTA rules. Not wanting to lock horns with the USTA, WTT ruled Richards not eligible to play as a female player until her court case was decided.|$|E
