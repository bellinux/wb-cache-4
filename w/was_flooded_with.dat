This flood {{had covered}} wooden objects that had {{completely}} rotted {{away by the}} time the tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals long gone.|$|E

The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was many more months before the machines were shipped. By August 1975, they had shipped over 5,000 computers.|$|E

By 15 June, the troops had advanced {{to the edge of}} Texass gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, Texas left Normandy for England on 18 June.|$|E

5|$|Green {{attended}} the University of Illinois {{from the fall}} of 1969, where she took a major in chemistry. Though she had intended to pursue chemical engineering as a career, she opted to attend medical school after graduating in 1972, believing the market <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> engineers. She {{attended the}} University of Kansas School of Medicine from 1972 to her graduation in 1975. Green chose emergency medicine as her initial specialty and undertook a residency in the Truman Medical Center Emergency Room after her graduation from medical school.|$|E
5|$|In Ascension, it is {{revealed}} that because Kratos renounced Ares, it broke his blood oath to the god and as such, Kratos was imprisoned and tortured {{by the three}} Furies. He was helped by the oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies. In order to completely be free of Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his oath to the god, he <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> memories of killing his family. He then vowed to serve the other gods {{in order to receive}} forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant.|$|E

After his win in the 1960 elections he <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{interior}} floor of this crater has <b>been</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> basaltic lava, leaving a dark, low-albedo surface that is relatively level and flat. It is somewhat unusual for a crater feature {{on the far side}} to <b>be</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> lava, as the crust is generally thicker than on the near side. However this crater is located entirely within the South Pole-Aitken basin.|$|R

5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> several inches to several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees {{at the house of}} J. Leonard Replogle.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup {{can be seen in}} eastern Grand Canyon in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was a shame that no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew {{water out of}} the gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage from the wind was generally minor, while most of the impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city <b>was</b> <b>flooded,</b> <b>with</b> the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company <b>was</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E
