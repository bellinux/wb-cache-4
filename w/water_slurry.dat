25|$|Currently (2007) about 219,000 {{cubic metres}} of sand is mined {{each year from}} the {{entrance}} and tidal deltas of the Kaipara. This sand contributes over half the sand requirements for Auckland. The sand {{is used in the}} production of concrete and asphalt, and also in drainage systems and beach nourishment.

This was the pulling of metal baskets and rakes across the river beds to stir up gold, and scoop out gravel that was rich in gold. It was later, when the gold in the river bed wasn't as plentiful, that new mining techniques were being developed to extract gold more efficiently from the ground. One of the main, and also most destructive methods was that of hydraulic mining. This involved the redirecting {{of water from the}} river into a narrow channel, into a large canvas hose, and iron nozzle. Then these water canons which were called monitors it would shoot a very high pressure stream that would break apart hillsides.
