5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E
5|$|An annual battle reenactment {{takes place}} on 15 July. In 2010 a pageant reenacting the event and commemorating the battle's 600th anniversary was held. It {{attracted}} 200,000 spectators <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> 2,200 participants {{playing the role of}} knights in a reenactment of the battle. An additional 3,800 participants played peasants and camp followers. The pageant's organizers believe that the event has become the largest reenactment of medieval combat in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Men <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> {{a sexually}} {{explicit}} movie {{have an average}} increase of 35% in testosterone, peaking at 60–90 minutes {{after the end of}} the film, but no increase is seen in men <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> sexually neutral films. Men <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> sexually explicit films also report increased motivation, competitiveness, and decreased exhaustion. [...] A link has also been found between relaxation following sexual arousal and testosterone levels.|$|R
5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie {{to do the same for}} Leeds but Revie, <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
5|$|As {{measured}} between 10:00am and 5:00pmEST, U.S.television viewership for the Obama inaugural events achieved {{an average}} of 37.8million across 17broadcast and cable channels, not including online viewers <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> live streaming video of the events. Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S.television viewership of 37.8million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S.television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8million across the ABC, CBS and NBC broadcast networks alone.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the {{criterion}} for the award was changed {{in an effort to}} further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film. All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 would also have received a Golden Film under the new criterion. From 2003 until 2007, the percentage of cinema visitors in the Netherlands <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.4%.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat the Chefs maintained {{less than a}} third of the viewers that tuned in to its lead-in. The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million viewers <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat the Chefs dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its lead-out, a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E

Two other important combined organisations, not part of AIB, were the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), which translated Japanese documents, and the Allied Geographical Section, which prepared maps and charts, and drafted appreciations of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Attendance {{levels at}} Andover's matches reached a {{peak in the}} late 1960s. During the 1969–70 season, home attendances at league matches {{averaged}} over 550, with the largest crowd being the 2,144 people <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> their FA Cup match against local rivals Salisbury. In the years following their promotion to the Southern League, average attendances started to drop until they dipped below the 200 mark during the 1970s. Since then, the average attendance at Andover's matches has remained at approximately 140, although this figure dipped below 100 in the 1999–2000 season following their last relegation from the Southern League. Just three seasons later however, this figure had risen to just under 200 following the club's second consecutive Wessex League championship and successes in cup competitions.|$|E
5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised {{the number of}} patients visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Hilton Head as a resort started in 1956 with Charles E. Fraser developing Sea Pines Resort. Soon, other developments followed, such as Hilton Head Plantation, Palmetto Dunes Plantation, Shipyard Plantation, and Port Royal Plantation, imitating Sea Pines' architecture and landscape. Sea Pines however continued {{to stand out}} by creating a unique locality within the plantation called Harbour Town, anchored by a recognizable lighthouse. Fraser was a committed environmentalist who changed the whole configuration of the marina at Harbour Town to save an ancient live oak. It {{came to be known}} as the Liberty Oak, known to generations of children <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> singer and songwriter Gregg Russell perform under the tree for over 25 years. Fraser was buried next to the tree when he died in 2002.|$|E

5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|Atlético had {{its first}} home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in {{downtown}} Belo Horizonte, {{across the street}} from América's first stadium. The club's main ground for most of its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos {{was one of the first}} stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> a night game for the first time. The stadium fell out of favour when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, {{across the street from}} Atlético's administrative headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E
