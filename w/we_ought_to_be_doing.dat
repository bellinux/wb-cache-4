40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} environmental citizenship in the United States. The term refers to responsibilities each of us have with respect to helping our communities and nation make sound environmental decisions. This research centers on the citizens and what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing,</b> {{as opposed to what}} the government ought to be doing for us, to improve environmental citizenship. This report examines four central questions: What are the requirements (i. e., responsibilities) of citizenship vis-a-vis environmental decision- making processes; what constraints limit people`s ability to meet these requirements; what does our form of governance do to help or hinder in meeting these requirements; and what recommendations can be put forth to improve public participation in environmental decision making...|$|E
40|$|The incentives-for-authors {{formulation}} of copyright’s purpose is so deeply ingrained in our discourse and our thought processes {{that it is}} astonishingly hard to avoid invoking, even when one is consciously trying not to do so. Yet avoiding that formulation is exactly what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing.</b> Everything we know about creativity and creative processes suggests that copyright plays very little role in motivating creative work. In the contemporary information society, the purpose of copyright is to enable the provision of capital and organization so that creative work may be exploited. And the choice of copyright as a principal means of promoting cultural production has consequences for the content of culture as well. This reframing has four important consequences for debates about copyright law and policy. First, abandoning the incentives-for-authors story requires {{us to talk about}} cultural progress differently. The incentives-for-authors story has functioned as a smokescreen, enabling scholars, judges, and legislators to conflate economic and creative motivation. Severing the motivational link between creativity and economics requires us {{to come up with a}} better understanding of how cultural progress emerges, and a more accurate account of how the economic incentives that copyright provides affect progress more generally. Second, an account of copyright as incentives-for-capital suggests a different approach to conceptualizing the kind of “property” that copyright represents. Copyright scholars habitually compare copyright to property in land, a conceptual move that passes over an important stage in the evolution of economic activity and associated economic rights. There are important benefits to be gained from comparing post-industrial, information property to industrial, corporate property, and copyright law more explicitly to corporate law. Specifically, copyright law in the post-industrial era works to separate authorship from control of creative works so that a set of coordination and governance problems closely associated with information resources can be solved. Third, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property and legal regimes governing its use suggests some different ways of thinking and talking about problems of social welfare that so often bedevil regimes of property law. Fourth, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property foregrounds copyright law’s (largely unrealized) potential to function as a tool for ensuring accountability to the authors without whom the copyright system could not function...|$|E

30|$|The key {{question}} is: {{what does this}} add to the explanatory value if the tier order can be one way - or another? Does the concept win or lose? Although the pyramid can {{be perceived as a}} static snapshot of the tiers of responsibility, it is nonetheless intended to be viewed as a flexible tool embodying a dynamic tension which allows the framework to adapt to enable a focus both on the present and the future. Clearly, corporate responsibilities have evolved over time as companies themselves have changed in relation to the business environment. Half a century ago, there was greatly stability in the business environment whereas today companies find themselves in much more dynamic situations, and this means that they have had to become more mature in the way they deal with these. In respect of corporate responsibility issues, the public (society) are expecting more, and business itself gives more. Indeed, CSR imperatives are now so pervasive that companies now have CR officers dedicated to managing this aspect of their existence, and operating as professionals in managing the companies’ relationships with all their stakeholders. The International Pyramid of CSR, like the concept, has failed. Success or failure should be measured in terms of a company’s net impact on the environment, and {{if there is to be}} any reversal of many of the world’s most pressing problems, e.g., social, environmental, local legislative, ethical trends and so on, a different kind of CSR is needed. It is easy to agree that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something good, and that we should contribute to doing ‘the right thing’, and there is evidence that the business community globally has been rapidly adopting CSR practices in both the developed and developing regions. We can see that corporations have learned to adapt to changes in economy, technology and politics. But they have also adapted to social change as public expectation has, over years and decades, experienced the modern corporation; which has been adoptable. The public have seen what it is and known what they have to do, and have done it. Consequently, the International Pyramid developed in this research and reported here, is built in a fashion that reflects the fundamental roles played and expected by business, which are seen as being to invest in society/community projects such that business implicitly concerns itself with the future.|$|E
