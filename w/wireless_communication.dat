5|$|At 06:30 the No. 5 Wing {{attacked}} the Ottoman defences, drawing some fire which revealed {{the locations of}} machine guns, trenches and five redoubts. The redoubts were arranged around the village, which protected the only available water supply in the area. During the day, pilots and their observers provided frequent reports; fourteen were received between 07:50 and 15:15, giving estimated positions, strength, and movements of the Ottoman garrison. These were most often given verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel's headquarters, as the aircraft did not at this time have <b>wireless</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German <b>wireless</b> <b>communication</b> for long afterwards.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{transducer}} {{system for}} <b>wireless</b> underwater <b>communication</b> is presented and discussed that utilizes multi-band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM {{is a topic}} of great interest for <b>wireless</b> underwater <b>communication</b> since it offers the potential of achieving higher transmission data rates compared to single carrier approaches. For <b>wireless</b> underwater <b>communication</b> applications, the frequency dependent attenuation links the maximum available bandwidth with the desired transmission distance. As the problem of bandwidth and a range restriction due to frequency dependent transmission loss and multi-path spreading leads to Inter-symbol Interference (ISI) and large Doppler shifts and spreads (Inter-carrier Interference ICI) : these parameters are crucial to improve <b>wireless</b> underwater <b>communication.</b> Additional to the parameters above mentioned, the battery powered network nodes limits the life time of the OFDM transceiver. For thus, the power efficiency is a desirable characteristic for <b>wireless</b> underwater <b>communication.</b> The goal {{of this study is}} to survey the determination and evaluation of the parameters of an OFDM transceiver for underwater communication based on the simulated channel characteristics...|$|R
