5|$|In 1812, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> highly {{unlikely}} that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the printed text showed that it was not related. The cantata was not published until 1876 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, the first complete edition of the composer's works.|$|E

5|$|According to Allmusic the {{original}} track was 3:09, but <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> on the 2006 compilation album Essential Nancy Sinatra, it was 3:11. The single was initially released through Reprise Records. In a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Reprise (part of Warner Music) gave RCA Records {{the rights to}} distribute the records {{of some of their}} artists including Sinatra and Dean Martin. In 1971, Sinatra and Reprise parted ways, so she signed a long-term contract with RCA Records.|$|E
5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 Labour Party {{leadership}} election, Benn {{backed the}} left-wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn {{called for the}} government to hold a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. In October 2007, at the age of 82, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> that a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election in 2007, and the constituency was subsequently abolished.|$|E

5|$|The series began {{receiving}} {{recognition in}} 2014, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! and had its volumes placed {{as one of}} the top thirty selling novels in Japan. It was reported in April 2014 that 1.1 million copies were in circulation. The English localization of the manga and anime were also well received: the manga adaption appeared on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers; meanwhile, English reviewers were generally turned away by the first episode of the anime, though reviewers who have completed the series generally praised the character dynamics, game strategies, and animation, while disliking the fan service featuring the underage Shiro.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> {{that the}} war would resume, four of the New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a {{defensive}} compact known as the United Colonies of New England. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, {{and he was the}} chief architect of the United Colonies. His experience in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national government.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, {{the mayor}} of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed {{the state board of}} health, informing them that yellow fever had reached {{epidemic}} levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E
5|$|After this turmoil, Severus faced no more {{internal}} threats for {{the rest}} of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate's newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.|$|E

5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
