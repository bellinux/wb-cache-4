As Cole lies dying in Railly's arms, she makes eye contact with a small boy—the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows {{a trail of}} blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E
40|$|Antigens {{capable of}} fixing {{complement}} specifically <b>with</b> <b>the</b> appropriate antibodies {{have been prepared}} from brain tissue of hamsters and mice infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of St. Louis, Japanese, Western, and Eastern encephalitis, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> West Nile <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> antigens were freed of the material which reacts with normal serum by means of centrifugation at relatively high speed. In addition, the infectivity of the preparation was destroyed by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Cross reactions were demonstrated by means of <b>the</b> complement-fixation technique <b>with</b> materials from animals infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> of Eastern and Western equine encephalitis. No relationship was detectable by this procedure between St. Louis, Japanese, and West Nile viruses. These findings emphasize {{the need for further}} investigation and correlation of the immunological reactions of the groups of neurotropic <b>viruses,</b> since <b>the</b> equine agents are apparently unrelated when studied by neutralization and cross-immunity tests while these methods provide evidence of the presence of common antigenic structures in the St. Louis, Japanese, and West Nile agents...|$|R

5|$|Kirk {{resolves}} {{to enter}} the Rip. After Enterprise enters the Gorn's galaxy, Kirk and Spock take a shuttle with Sulu (voiced by John Cho) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) to a nearby planet. When their shuttle is shot down, Kirk and Spock use wingsuits to glide to a Gorn outpost and blow it up before infiltrating a base to rescue T'Mar. They find Daniels, who is killed in an ensuing firefight. The Gorn bring Kirk and Spock to the Commander, who has them taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death. Angered by their besting of his champion, the Commander has Spock infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> and pits him against Kirk. Sulu's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with an antidote, while the Commander flees to his ship with T'Mar and the device.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Teena Mulder (Rebecca Toolan) and The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) visit Mulder, who is paralyzed in a hospital. After {{administering}} a {{drug that}} cures his paralysis, The Smoking Man reveals himself to be Mulder's father and takes him from the hospital. Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial black oil with which he was infected three years previously; because he is infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> Mulder is proof of alien life. Skinner, who has been looking for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed {{him out of the}} hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to an unfamiliar neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin). Deep Throat claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the Syndicate, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same. Mulder meets Fowley, and the two become intimate.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected cells {{is to produce}} interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{arrives in}} Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then {{hospital}}ized {{in a mental}} hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed {{by a panel of}} doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E
