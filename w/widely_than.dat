5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> usual during courtship.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with the Khmer script, an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E

However, {{it has not been}} known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa. In Cameroon, they are widely distributed. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they can be found both in peri-urban environments as well as in rural regions, for example, in South Kivu. They are also frequently held in rural households in Iringa Region of southwestern Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} {{are influenced by}} the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in italic. An engraver with a long and wide-ranging career, Granjon’s work seems to have ranged much more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> Garamond’s focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type in italic, civilité (a cursive blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of}} the rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E

5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{importation}} of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> other types; this led to King Cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a commodity by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.|$|E
25|$|All titanosaurs {{had what}} is called wide-gauge posture, a {{relative}} term to describe a stance in which the feet fell apart from the body midline. More derived titanosaurs had {{a greater degree of}} wide-gauge posture, with their limbs held more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> their ancestors and contemporaneous counterparts. The stance of Dreadnoughtus schrani was clearly wide-gauge, but not to the degree of saltasaurids because the femoral condyles are perpendicular to its shaft rather than beveled. This {{and the fact that the}} head of the femur was not turned in towards the body as in saltasaurids support the phylogenetic conclusion that Dreadnoughtus was not a saltasaurid. The animal’s broad sternal bones also demonstrate a wide pectoral girdle, giving it a broad-shouldered, broad-chested appearance. Paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara compared the animal's gait to an Imperial Walker.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{various types}} of medals, {{some part of the}} {{official}} honours system and others not. Those in the former category tend to be related to state organisations, such as police forces, fire protection, or the military. These can be further sub-categorised into long service and campaign medals. Others are awarded to military and civilians alike for anniversaries—the Canadian Centennial or the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, for example—or for community service. Still others are awarded by international organisations and integrated into the Canadian honours structure; the United Nations Medals and North Atlantic Treaty Organization medals, for example. As medals are awarded more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> orders or decorations, they are typically presented by higher-ranking officials in the organization the recipient is a part of. Only the Canadian Forces Decoration grants a holder the use of post-nominal letters.|$|E

25|$|In one study, the zebra's diet was {{estimated}} to be 92% grass, 5% herbs, and 3% shrubs. Unlike many of the large ungulates of Africa, the plains zebra does not require (but still prefers) short grass to graze. It eats a wide range of different grasses, preferring young, fresh growth where available, and also browses on leaves and shoots from time to time. In consequence, it ranges more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> many other species, even into woodlands, and it is often the first grazing species to appear in a well-vegetated area. Zebras have a simple stomach and use hindgut fermentation (caeco-colic), which allows them to digest and assimilate larger amounts of forage during a 24-hour period. Thus, zebras are less selective in foraging, but they do spend much time eating. The zebra is a pioneer grazer and prepares the way for more specialised grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses.|$|E
25|$|Although {{credit cards}} reached very high {{adoption}} {{levels in the}} US, Canada and the UK during the latter 20th century, many cultures were more cash-oriented or developed alternative forms of cashless payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Due to strict regulations regarding bank overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much quicker to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, and UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low {{as the use of}} a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country; while in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash-oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly to the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, the trend is toward RFID-based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in that most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more <b>widely</b> <b>than</b> the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E
