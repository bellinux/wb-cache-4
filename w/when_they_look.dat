5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit. The dead Doctor is {{revealed}} to be an older self, after his younger version returns. They try {{to understand what the}} future Doctor said and are sent to Washington D.C. The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter with them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> away.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, Xanthippe has {{a vision}} and collapses. Her husband soon awakes and, {{having had a}} dream, asks some wise men for an interpretation. They declare that the dream reveals the {{struggle}} between Satan and Christ and advise that the husband be baptized. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> in on his wife Xanthippe, expecting her to be near death, they discover her singing praises to Jesus. This impresses the wise men {{to the extent that}} they have Xanthippe take them to Paul. All of this induces her husband to likewise convert.|$|E
25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds {{to the color of}} the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E

25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> {{at a red}} tomato, and see exactly how they react {{and what kinds of}} impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|While the Pevensies {{are playing}} hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a {{wardrobe}} and enters a wintry fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who explains the land she has entered and invites {{her to his}} home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving, and he explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia {{and it has been}} winter for 100 years. If a human is encountered they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed in the normal world; her siblings do not believe her story, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> in the wardrobe to see only a normal back.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the signal}} photons whose {{entangled}} idlers were detected at D3 or D4, they detected simple diffraction patterns with no interference.|$|R
60|$|NO one {{answered}} the doctor's knock {{when he and}} his companion reached the antechamber door of Mr. Armadale's apartments. They entered unannounced; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> into the sitting-room, the sitting-room was empty.|$|R
500|$|Examples of Smith's {{penchant for}} zany wordplay include the lines [...] "Never over-sits he under-stands" [...] and [...] "Get lined up come Sikh come Czar" [...] – {{the latter being}} partly a {{misappropriation}} of the French phrase [...] "comme ci comme ça". In the second verse, the line [...] "People think he's loopy loo <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at his shoes" [...] refers to the comedian's unusual dress sense, which included [...] "toy cows grazing on his shoes", according to Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, while [...] "rocking sausage roll" [...] was Smith's phrase for rock 'n' roll.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{has said}} in {{reference}} to ants [...] "Karl Marx was right, socialism works, {{it is just that}} he had the wrong species". He meant that while ants and other eusocial species appear to live in communist-like societies, they only do so because they are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen in order to survive as a colony and a species, and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen and are thus forced to live in centralised societies. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a [...] "queen", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about you, shut up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I think it just sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind of does it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. I think it does something to a woman <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> good".|$|E
50|$|The mall barely escaped {{destruction}} {{when the}} Plainfield Tornado passed {{within a few}} hundred yards of the southwest entrance. Some shoppers report seeing nothing but a huge, black wall <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> to the southwest.|$|R
60|$|Again they hastened on, {{and entered}} Blackmore Vale. Coggan's watch struck one. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> again the hoof-marks were so spaced as {{to form a}} sort of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.|$|R
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> round them, {{that seemed}} too true. The thunder storm did not merely melt the snow, cool the air, bring {{refreshing}} rain; it sometimes blasted trees, houses, men; {{that they thought}} was Thor's anger.|$|R
2500|$|On {{an episode}} of the Charlie Rose Show marking the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Bawer {{took part in a}} {{discussion}} with fellow gay moderate Andrew Sullivan and gay-left writers Tony Kushner and Donna Minkowitz. Minkowitz underlined the conflict between {{the two sides of the}} gay-rights movement by saying: “We don't want a place at the table! We want to turn the table over!” A New York Public Library lecture by Bawer, also marking the 25th anniversary of Stonewall, appeared in abbreviated form as a cover story in the New Republic. [...] A Washington Post article about the 25th anniversary of Stonewall quoted Bawer on gay pride marches: “It's hard to make straight people understand how serious an issue gay rights is <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> and see a kind of Mardi Gras atmosphere... It doesn't communicate the idea that these are serious issues.” In a letter to The New York Times, Bawer criticized an editorial that ran on the morning of the Stonewall 25 gay-pride march. The editors chided “gay moderates and conservatives” for seeking “to assure the country that the vast majority of gay people are 'regular' people just like the folks next door.” Bawer retorted, in part: “Well, most gays do live next door to straight people... we're not putting down cross-dressers or leathermen or anyone else; we're simply refuting an extremely misleading stereotype.” After the publication of A Place at the Table, Bawer wrote widely about gay life, culture, and politics. From 1994 to 1999, he was a regular columnist for The Advocate, the gay newsmagazine. His Advocate columns and other articles by Bawer on gay issues were later collected in an e-book, The Marrying Kind.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E

60|$|They {{could hardly}} believe that Tom would have gone so far; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at that awful cliff, they could never believe {{that he would have}} dared to face it. But if the dog said so, it must be true.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>they</b> {{were amazed}} and horrified {{to see a}} spotted green snake coiled comfortably up in the pinafore.

50|$|There is an {{old story}} that guests staying at Glamis once hung towels from the windows of every room {{in a bid to}} find the bricked-up suite of the monster. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at it from outside, several windows were {{apparently}} towel-less.|$|R

6000|$|... "Has Mr. Mirabel {{been more}} {{interesting}} than usual?" [...] Alban asked gayly. Whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in Emily's absence, was forgotten the moment she appeared; all traces of trouble in his face vanished <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at each other.|$|R
60|$|They {{plunged into}} a snow-drift to the knees, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had floundered through it for thirty yards or so Weston sank {{suddenly}} well over his waist.

6000|$|... "An American millionaire who didn't wear armour," [...] she {{answered}} blandly.

60|$|She {{certainly}} looked quite adorable on the wall. She {{had a fine}} {{neck and}} pointed chin that was particularly admirable from below, and pretty eyes and fine eyebrows are never so pretty as <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> down upon one. But no calculation of that sort, thank Heaven, was going on beneath her ruddy shock of hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said Freydissa, [...] "that your new land {{is but a}} sorry place--worse than that we have left. I wonder at your landing here.

6000|$|... "Don't be downhearted, Miss de la Molle. Things {{change in}} a {{wonderful}} way, and often they mend <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> worst.

60|$|It merely slid {{downward}} a few feet, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the place}} where it had been they discovered {{what seemed to be a}} small iron door, built into the solid stone underneath, and now shown to their view by the moving of the upper rock.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Graham and the Fraulein looked pitifully at {{one another}} at the delusion; but they let the lad have the spoon with the drops of brandy. He had already gained {{experience}} in giving it, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> for disappointment, his eyes were raised in joy.|$|R
60|$|They obeyed, weeping, yes, even Grey Dick wept a little. Presently <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>they</b> {{saw that}} Sir Geoffrey was dead, dead without pain or sorrow. Of the {{first he had}} {{suffered}} none for days, and the second was far from him who wished to die.|$|R
