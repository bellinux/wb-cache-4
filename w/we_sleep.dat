The Latin {{inscription}} on their tomb, [...] "Regno consortes & urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis", translates to [...] "Consorts in realm and tomb, here <b>we</b> <b>sleep,</b> Elizabeth and Mary, sisters, in hope of resurrection".|$|E
500|$|Ida Skelton, {{who held}} {{multiple}} jobs {{to support her}} family {{after the death of}} her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but [...] "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined [...] "Doc" [...] R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: [...] "We get plenty to eat, and <b>we</b> <b>sleep</b> in the wagon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, having used {{psychoanalysis}} to explain Hamlet, Freud uses Hamlet to explain the nature of dreams: in disguising himself as a madman and adopting the license of the fool, Hamlet [...] "was behaving just as dreams do in reality ... concealing the true circumstances under a cloak of wit and unintelligibility". When <b>we</b> <b>sleep,</b> each of us adopts an [...] "antic disposition".|$|E

2500|$|Fear {{could easily}} be argued as another {{character}} in Albee’s play. It is an unnamed fear that moves Harry and Edna out of their house and {{into the middle of}} the chaos in the home of Agnes and Tobias. As Harry and Edna explain it: “WE GOT [...] [...] [...] FRIGHTENED.” “We got scared.” We [...] [...] [...] were [...] [...] [...] terrified.” The fear is described as darkness, as when Agnes says: “I wonder if that’s why <b>we</b> <b>sleep</b> at night, because the darkness still [...] [...] [...] frightens us?” Agnes also labels fear as “the terror. Or the plague”, and she states that Harry and Edna have brought the plague with them. And she claims that the only solution is isolation.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April 1912, {{the night}} of the sinking, Lowe had been {{relieved}} at 8.00 PM by Sixth Officer Moody and was asleep in his quarters when the ship hit the iceberg at 11.40PM. He remained asleep through the collision and did not wake up until as much as half an hour had passed; as he explained later, [...] "We officers do not have any too much sleep, and therefore when <b>we</b> <b>sleep,</b> we die." [...] When Lowe finally awakened and realised the situation, he immediately got dressed, grabbed his revolver, and went to work. Third Officer Pitman charged him with loading lifeboat No. 5. Around 1.30AM, Lowe engaged in a conversation with Sixth Officer Moody: While launching lifeboat Nos. 14 and 16 on the port side of the ship, the two junior officers felt that this group of boats needed to have an officer with them. Moody insisted that Lowe should get onto lifeboat No. 14 and that he would get on another one. By the time lifeboat 14 was being launched, things were beginning to get precarious on the boat deck as the majority of passengers began to realise that the giant ship was foundering. As lifeboat 14 was descending, Lowe used his revolver to fire three shots into the air in order to frighten away a group of men attempting to leap into the lifeboat.|$|E

2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say <b>we</b> <b>sleep</b> to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
