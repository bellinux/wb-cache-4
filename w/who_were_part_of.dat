5|$|Further {{activities}} of Operation Labrador were abandoned in September, after Croatian authorities captured the Yugoslav Air Force regional headquarters in Zagreb, and confiscated {{documents related to}} the operation. The authorities took nearly a month to analyze the captured documents, allowing time for the principal agents involved in the bombings to flee. Fifteen others were arrested {{in connection with the}} attack, but they were subsequently released in a prisoner exchange. Five KOS agents involved in Operation Labrador were tried in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on terrorism charges and acquitted. Croatian authorities captured two KOS agents <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the operation and tried them along with seven other agents who were tried in absentia.

5|$|The Catholic Church was persecuted {{under the}} Third Reich, with the Nazi {{leadership}} hoping to gradually de-Christianize Germany. Political Catholicism was {{a target of}} Hitler's 1934 Night of the Long Knives. German clergy, nuns and lay leaders were also targeted after the Nazi takeover, leading to thousands of arrests over the following years. Priests <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic resistance were killed. Hitler's invasion of Catholic Poland in 1939 began World War II, and the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their campaign to destroy Polish culture.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Camet did, however, {{travel to}} Amsterdam to {{participate}} in the 1928 Summer Olympics. He was joined by four teammates: Roberto Larraz and Luis Lucchetti, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 1924 delegation that had placed in fifth place, and newcomers Raul Anganuzzi and Héctor Lucchetti. The fencing competition took place from July 29 to August 11. Camet, who was a substitute, sat out of the matches against Norway and Spain, before being called to replace Héctor Lucchetti against Belgium. After entering the quarter-finals, the team defeated the United States and the Netherlands, advancing undefeated to the quarter-finals, where they bested Hungary. The Argentine team then lost against Italy and France, the eventual gold and silver medal-winning teams respectively. The competition for the bronze medal, which would have been between Belgium and Argentina, was scrapped because the latter had already defeated the former.|$|E

5|$|During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were {{implicated in}} two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, {{allowing}} time for loyalists {{to relieve the}} president. Many of the officers involved had links to or {{were members of the}} VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cừson of a prominent VNQDD leaderand Phạm Phú Quốc, bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill the president and his family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.|$|E
5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the visiting dance troupe.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of}} the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and {{filed a lawsuit against}} the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E
5|$|The Maltese {{position}} {{had already}} been severely weakened by {{the large number of}} Frenchmen <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Order, who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources. On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean. To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria. On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers. From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.|$|E
