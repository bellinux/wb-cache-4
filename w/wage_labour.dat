In 1944 his book Capitalism and Slavery argued that the British abolition of their Atlantic slave trade in 1807 was motivated primarily by economics—rather than by altruism or humanitarianism. By extension, so was the emancipation of the slaves and the fight against the trading in slaves by other nations. As industrial capitalism and <b>wage</b> <b>labour</b> began to expand, eliminating the competition from slavery became economically advantageous.|$|E

Late Ming laissez-faire policies such as nonintervention in markets and low taxes further stimulated commerce and trade. During the Ming dynasty, the Chinese economy became very commercialised, as market agriculture replaced subsistence farming. <b>Wage</b> <b>labour</b> became increasingly common, as large-scale private industry developed, displacing and often buying out government workshops. Historian Robert Allen estimates that family incomes and labor productivity of the Ming-era Yangtze Delta Region, the richest province of China, was far higher than contemporary Europe and exceeded the later Qing dynasty.|$|E

25|$|After {{slavery was}} phased out by 1888, many former slaves {{had little choice}} but to stay on the farms on which they had been prisoners for years. The {{plantation}} owners adapted to the situation by incorporating <b>wage</b> <b>labour,</b> tenantry and contract farming. After gaining their freedom, some more fortunate ex-slaves were sold small plots of land where they could build a house and plant crops for their own consumption and for sale at market. According to the Spanish Civil Code, rights of possession were paramount, making a signed and verified agreement very important. In 1890, however, a new civil code (which had been introduced in Spain the year before) came into effect which acknowledged the rights of prescription (squatter’s rights). Granted, these rights were minimally recognized, but still they motivated many landless workers to occupy and cultivate previously unused land.|$|E
25|$|The canons {{were much}} {{employed}} {{in managing the}} abbey's substantial estates, which {{seem to have been}} worked mainly by indentured servants and later by <b>wage</b> <b>labour.</b> A fairly high proportion of the abbey's land was kept in demesne, cultivated from granges. The Lilleshall estate alone had four of these and there was a ring of further granges in Shropshire and Staffordshire, with two outlying at Blackfordby and Grindlow. The grange at Blackfordby seems to have absorbed {{a good deal of time}} and labour, with canons often staying there. There was even a chapel on site, with mass said three times a week. This was strictly irregular, as it was considered perilous to the soul for a canon to reside anywhere alone, and there were complaints about it from the Bishop of Lichfield. However, the nature of the abbey's estates meant that canons would often require leave to travel. Both this and the increasingly unfavourable agrarian conditions and labour market of the 14th century meant that direct exploitation of demesnes was gradually reduced in favour of leasing out land.|$|E

The IFTU also proposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in Paris which would only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to <b>wage</b> <b>labour</b> and the establishment of socialism.

25|$|Prominent Guyanese {{scholar and}} {{political}} activist Walter Rodney wrote {{at length about}} the economic exploitation of Africa by the colonial powers. In particular, he saw labourers as an especially abused group. While a capitalist system almost always employs some form of <b>wage</b> <b>labour,</b> the dynamic between labourers and colonial powers left the way open for extreme misconduct. According the Rodney, African workers were more exploited than Europeans because the colonial system produced a complete monopoly on political power and left the working class small and incapable of collective action. Combined with deep-seated racism, native workers were presented with impossible circumstances. The racism and superiority felt by the colonizers enabled them to justify the systematic underpayment of Africans {{even when they were}} working alongside European workers. Colonialists further defended their disparate incomes by claiming a higher cost of living. Rodney challenged this pretext and asserted the European quality of life and cost of living were only possible because of the exploitation of the colonies and African living standards were intentionally depressed in order to maximize revenue. In its wake, colonialism left Africa vastly underdeveloped and without a path forward.|$|E
25|$|Following this {{check to}} {{its attempt to}} create a {{workforce}} that would enable it to exploit its estates directly, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd explored alternative methods of utilising its land. The company did continue to grow tea and some tobacco using the direct labour of tenants under the thangata system or by <b>wage</b> <b>labour.</b> The tobacco produced by direct labour was Flue-cured tobacco, which was cured in brick barns by hot air conducted through metal flues, without smoke coming into contact with the leaf. Its final colour was yellowish brown and it was normally used for cigarettes or as pipe tobacco. This became a significant export for the company from 1907. Although in 1901 it had owned 157,000 acres, the company’s first alternative strategy was to sell or lease some of its land, particularly after the First World War to small planters, which reduced this to 119,500 acres by 1925. Most of the sales and leases were in Blantyre District, the most developed part of the protectorate. Secondly, on its smaller remaining estates in the Shire Highlands and beyond, it ceased to provide supervision but sought to obtain cash rents from African tenants, as it had no need for their labour. Finally, on its largest remaining estate in Zomba District, Blantyre and East Africa Ltd pioneered African tobacco production from 1901. This was of fire-cured tobacco, also known also as dark-fired tobacco, which is cured over open fires, so the leaf absorbs various flavours from the smoke, and substantial acreages were set aside for tobacco growing by African tenants. At first, success was limited, but from 1916, the company increased African production by allocating land, supplying seed, giving instruction and providing suitable storage barns for its tenants. The tobacco they produced is described as of good saleable quality.|$|E

As mentioned above, in the case of social contributions the literature points at two basic shifting processes. Consumers may bear the burden if firms have enough market power to adjust prices to the new tax rates. This is known as forward shifting. Alternatively, employees may bear the burden if the firm offsets the new tax burden with a (net) negative <b>wage</b> variation, leaving <b>labour</b> costs constant, a process known as backward shifting.|$|R
40|$|Young {{people who}} are not in education, {{employment}} or training (NEET) are construed by policy makers as a pressing problem about which something should be done. Such young people's lack of employment is thought to pose difficulties for wider society in relation to social cohesion and inclusion and it is feared that they will become a 'lost generation'. This paper(1) draws upon English research, seeking to historicise the debate whilst acknowledging that these issues have a much wider purchase. The notion of NEETs rests alongside longstanding concerns of the English state and middle classes, addressing unruly male working class youth as well as the moral turpitude of working class girls. <b>Waged</b> <b>labour</b> and domesticity are seen as a means to integrate such groups into society thereby generating social cohesion. The paper places the debate within it socio-economic context and draws on theorisations of cognitive capitalism, Italian workerism, as well as emerging theories of antiwork to analyse these. It concludes by arguing that ‘radical’ approaches to NEETs that point towards inequities embedded in the social structure and call for social democratic solutions veer towards a form of comfort radicalism.

Lenin in particular tended to overlook this, when he contrasted being and idea in his 'reflection theory'. The superstructure is no less real than its base. The terms 'reflection' and 'to reflect', which Engels was fond of using when he was discussing ideological superstructure, can be misleading; these terms are meant to indicate something {{about the relationship between}} base and superstructure, not to describe the superstructure itself. There are in fact two forms of reality: the material reality and the 'ideal' reality (ie, the reality of human ideas). Political and legal superstructure are as real as the base. Both are social relations consisting of human relationships. Both exist in the idea, both are also material realities. As Marx said in The Holy Family, 'The communist workers know full well that property, capital, money, <b>wage</b> <b>labour</b> etc. are in no way the mere creations of their imagination but are the extremely concrete and practical results of their own self-alienation', and {{the same is true of}} non-economic relationships.

Material relations are what they are only in conjunction with the ideas which correspond to them. The reality of both is expressed by their social efficacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{judicial}} {{and political}} failure of Bennett's New Deal legislation shifted {{the struggle to}} reconstitute capitalism to the provincial and municipal levels of the state. Attempts {{to deal with the}} dislocations of the Great Depression in Ontario focused on the [...] "sweatshop crisis" [...] that came to dominate political and social discourse after 1934. Ontario's 1935 Industrial Standards Act (ISA) was designed to bring workers and employers together {{under the auspices of the}} state to establish minimum wages and work standards. The establishment of New Deal style industrial codes was premised on the mobilization of organized capital and organized labour to combat unfair competition, stop the spread of relief-subsidized labour, and halt the predations of sweatshop capitalism. Although the ISA did not bring about extensive economic regulation, it excited considerable interest in the possibility of government intervention. Workers in a diverse range of occupations, from asbestos workers to waitresses, attempted to organize around the possibility of the ISA. The importance of the ISA lies in what it reveals about the nature of welfare, <b>wage</b> <b>labour,</b> the union movement, competitive capitalism, business attitudes toward industrial regulation, and the role of the state in managing the collective affairs of capitalism. The history of the ISA also suggests that [...] "regulatory unionism," [...] as described by Colin Gordon in his work on the American New Deal, may have animated key developments in Canadian social, economic, and labour history.|$|E

Second, minimum wages - and <b>wage</b> and <b>labour</b> controls more generally - can enhance redistributive efficiency.

Legislation about women's <b>waged</b> <b>labour</b> has balanced {{the needs of}} the labour market and society's need for family sta­bility and childrearing. This balancing has added to the sub­ordination of women in <b>waged</b> <b>labour</b> and to the institutio­nalization of part-time labour for women. Housework, which is the basis for the inequality between women and men in the labour market, has been excluded from legislation as has waged work that is similar to housework. Although the Swe­dish employment protection law should give the same pro­tection to women as to men, important resolutions in it can be overridden by contracts between the employers and the unions. An investigation of 75 workplaces presented in this book, shows that although women's employments are almost as long as men's, women are fired more often than men, due to negotiated exceptions from the legal rules. The firing of the women is connected with the kind of work they are doing and very often with {{the fact that they are}} part-time workers. Other women have had their hours of employment reduced. Women who are pregnant and women who are on maternity leave have been fired. Women's right to keep their jobs has also been influenced by their marriages or relation­ships to male bosses or more qualified co-workers.
