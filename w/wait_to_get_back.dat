500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in the dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E

The study examines the multiple meanings of citizenship and analyzes the relationship of Italian Oriundi Brazilians with the country of their ancestors: on the one hand, the interviewees live {{in a sort of}} “market of citizenship”, managed by officers with variable levels of expertise and honesty. These officers are responsible for searching the documents required to obtain Italian citizenship and sell the “Italian dream” at great cost. On the other hand, young Brazilians consider their journey to Italy as a way back to their origins, guided by their memories and those of their family and supported by transnational networks of relatives and friends. The case study here presented highlights how migrations are actually endless. These are instead more similar to round trips: young Brazilians’ way back to Italy is opposite to that of their grandparents and great grandparents travelling to Brazil in the past; furthermore, it is a way for them to restore an emotional bond as well as a formal link with the land of their ancestors, but also to search for better opportunities in Italy and in Europe...|$|R

50|$|The protest at Piast {{began in}} the morning of December 14, 1981, 650 meters below the ground. Miners of the first shift lay down their tools, upon hearing that Eugeniusz Szelągowski, deputy of Factory Committee of Solidarity, had been arrested, {{together}} with Stanisław Dziwak of Factory Committee of Solidarity at Enterprise of Mining Works at nearby town of Mysłowice. The strike was initiated by one person, Stanisław Trybus. At {{the end of the first}} shift, when miners were <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the surface and go home, he jumped on a bench and cried that they should do something about the arrests of their fellow union activists. After years, Trybus stated that he was surprised at the reaction of other miners, as his idea was universally supported. In the evening of that day, four members of Factory Committee of Solidarity went down the shaft - chairman Wiesław Zawadzki, also Andrzej Machalica, Andrzej Oczko, and Adam Urbańczyk, as well as a member of Solidarity’s National Coordinating Commission of Mining, Zbigniew Bogacz. All five had been asked by the manager of the mine to convince the workers to end the strike. Instead, Zawadzki and his people remained underground. Meanwhile, crews of second and third shifts joined the protest, and by December 15, some 2,000 stayed in the dark underground corridors. Their lamps had been used up, but the management did not allow to replace them, so the miners spent two weeks in darkness. From the very beginning, the action was voluntary, and its organizers made it clear that those who did not wish to protest, were free to leave the mine. The protest was supported by families of miners, as well as inhabitants of the town. Also, those miners who remained on the surface, collected money for their collegaues. On December 15, a pay day, some 1,5 million zlotys was collected for them.|$|R
50|$|UCLA {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half, after gaining 23 yards {{they were forced to}} punt back to Oregon. The Ducks again completed a long drive down the field, this time 80 yards, ending a play that made Marcus Mariota looking more like a point-guard than a quarterback. From their opponent's three yard line the Ducks ran their staple zone-read play, this time Mariota kept the ball, attempting to run it in for a score. He was tripped on his way to end-zone, dropped the football only to have it bounce back into his hands, causing a defender to freeze just long enough for Mariota to find the end-zone for another score, making the score 28-10 in their favor. The Oregon offense didn't have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> long <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> on the field after their scoring drive as UCLA's Brett Hundley was intercepted by All-American cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu on their second play of the drive.
