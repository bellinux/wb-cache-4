40|$|Abstract The most {{important}} components of <b>wool</b> scouring effluent <b>grease</b> are esters of sterols. Cholesteryl palmitate (CP) {{is the main}} ester in this grease. In this paper, {{the influence of the}} ester concentration in the anaerobic digestion and the relative rate of the different degradation steps, are studied. The experiment was carried out to measure methane production in the anaerobic degradation of acetate, palmitic acid (PA) and CP. A first-order kinetic model was assumed for hydrolysis and Monod models were assumed for both the methanogenic and acetogenic steps. Maximum hydrolysis rate was found to be around 20 times faster than the maximum methanogenic reaction rate during the experience. The lanolin emulsion drop size effect was also evaluated employing fine and coarse stock lanolin emulsions and no adapted sludge. Concentrations of 13. 7 to 4. 6 gCOD. l– 1 were employed. In a previous study, the effect of palmitic acid emulsion size was found important when similar sludge was tested. When esters are degraded, a significant effect of drop size on the degradation rate was not found. The difference between CP and PA emulsions behavior could be {{due to the fact that}} cholesterol produced during the ester degradation has a protective effect on the sludge...|$|R

REPRODUCTION AND LAMB PRODUCTION Relationships among {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) genotypes {{and reproduction}} and production traits {{were examined in}} 294 four- and five-year-old North Country Cheviot, Dorset, Finnsheep or Romney x Suffolk or Columbia-type crossbred ewes. Hb BB ewe lambs were youngest at first estrus and Hb AA ewe lambs were oldest. The differences were small but consistent across crossbred groups. Ewe lamb fertility was similar for Hb AB and Hb BB ewes, and both were superior to Hb AA ewes. The difference among Hb genotypes in ewe lamb fertility, when the two Finnsheep groups (in which the Hb BB genotype was absent) were excluded, favored ewes with Hb BB over ewes with Hb AB. Results suggested heterozygote advantage in prolificacy of ewe lambs with a minor advantage of the A over the B allele. Hb BB ewes were highest, Hb AB ewes were intermediate and Hb AA ewes were lowest for average fertility over all production years. For prolificacy per ewe lambing and prolificacy per ewe exposed to mating, Hb BB ewes were superior to Hb AB and Hb AA ewes. Hb BB ewes were also superior, Hb AB ewes were intermediate and Hb AA ewes were lowest for total number and total kg. of lambs weaned. Results suggested that-the B allele enhances most traits associated with reproductive fitness. There was little suggestion of heterozygote advantage for those same characteristics. II. WOOL AND MILK PRODUCTION AND HEALTH RELATED TRAITS Relationships among hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes (Hb AA, Hb AB or Hb BB) and wool production, milk production and health related traits were examined in 294 North Country Cheviot, Dorset, Finnsheep or Romney, Suffolk or Columbia-type crossbred ewes. <b>Grease</b> <b>wool</b> production, staple length and side and britch fiber grades were very similar across Hb genotypes. Incidence of medullated fibers also {{did not differ significantly}} among ewes of varying Hb type.

Overdominance (as for footrot resistance) and the moderate beneficial effect of the A allele on health related traits (as for mastitis and parasite resistance) that are suggested by our findings, if real, could contribute to variation in longevity which in turn could partly explain the genetic polymorphism commonly encountered at the Hb locus in sheep...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Existing ways of {{extraction}} of <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> have {{the high cost}} price and are not harmless. For increase of efficiency of {{extraction of}} <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> in work application high-discrete processing (HDP) wool-washing water is offered. Materials and methods. Determination of conductivity, RedOx-potential, temperature, pH and {{the total number of}} lipid-water ions was carried out using a combined tester Combo HI 98129 («HANNA Instruments»). Concentration of free radicals was determined by titration method. Viscosity change of washwater under the influence of HDP was investigated by the method of measurement by an Ostwald. Influence of duration of the HDP to change the surface tension of the wash water was measured by counting drops. Resultsand discussion. As a result of HDP, there is a change of physical and chemical properties of the wash water, namely: reduction of conductivity wool-washing water (from 2969 µS/cm to 2837 µS/cm) and the total ion content (1487 mg/l to 1298 mg/l), increased pH environment (8. 35 to 9. 40), temperature (from 18 °C to 43 °C) and RedOx-capacity (from 60 mV to 93 mV). This is because HDP helps create areas of high concentration of mechanical energy, which leads to a high impact strength and high pressure. Temperature rise in turn affects the hydrogen bonds, with the collapse cluster complexes of water and hydration shells around ions with the formation of free radicals, which means, that the presence of chemical reactions in the water. Reduced viscosity (with 1, 034 · 10 - 3 Ns/m 2 to 0, 903 · 10 - 3 Ns/m 2) and surfacetension (from 39. 86 cN/m to 37. 56 cN/m) of wash water {{under the influence of the}} HDP is due to breaking of hydrogen bonds of water associates and the weakening of the forces of attraction between the molecules within the clusters and in the surface layer – structural changes of water. The most important chemical and structural changes occur in the washings at 180 with the processing time. Conclusions.

Since no significant net grease (supernatant plus sludge) reduction {{was observed in}} this system, the grease emulsion from the liquid phase is simply settled by gravity into the sludge phase. However, sterilized sludge did not cause this effect, indicating that bacterial metabolic activity {{was responsible for the}} bioflocculation. It was also found that such microbes can successfully survive and multiply in WSE, as a result, the development of a continuous process is possible. The process required a short gentle mixing period of approx. 15 min to enable the sludge to completely contact with WSE, and a longer settling period of 2 - 4 days to provide an appropriate time for the microbes to destabilize <b>wool</b> <b>grease</b> emulsion and settle to the sludge phase...|$|E
