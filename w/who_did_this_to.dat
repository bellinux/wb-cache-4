25|$|Hanging {{from the}} cross, Jesus prays to God asking {{forgiveness}} {{for the people}} <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> him, and redeems a criminal as a saint who is crucified beside him. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus gives up his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the cloth covering the Holy of Holies in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonized defeat. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected.|$|E

Only {{a small number of}} humans proved susceptible to this syndrome, and most did not survive the initial stages of infection. But several people who proved somewhat longer-lived (though still dying) were gathered together by a man known only as Ryder, who was himself a victim of the disease, to act out their increasingly irrational impulses to seek out and destroy the ones <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> them (by [...] "letting" [...] themselves get turned into cows), usually by graphically [...] "blowing away" [...] the Skrulls with high-powered weapons.|$|E

50|$|Technically CTOs are not fakes {{since they}} have been {{cancelled}} by the stamp issuing authority. Many of these are easily identified because while they have been postmarked they still retain their original gum. Some postal authorities cancel them and sell them at a considerable discount to the philatelic community. The authorities can do that profitably because they {{no longer need to}} provide the postal services that the stamps were meant to pay for. Many collectors are more interested in stamps that have been correctly used, and the corresponding used stamp may often be worth more than a mint stamp. Authorities <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> tend <b>to</b> use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time.|$|R

[...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's performances and ability to make audiences angry at BP: [...] "I’ll be honest, I didn’t think we needed a movie about this subject. I’ve changed my mind. And, if nothing else, I hope it gets people angry again, because the people <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> our planet, and killed 11 people in the process, got off too easy." [...] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian praised Berg's direction as [...] "admirably, uncharacteristically restrained...He stages the action horribly well, capturing the panic and gruesome mayhem without the film ever feeling exploitative. It’s spectacularly constructed, yet it doesn’t forget {{about the loss of}} life, ensuring that, despite thin characterisation, the impact is felt." ...|$|E

When a Rikers Island medical team reached Spear, he was unresponsive, and after failed attempts to resurrect him, he was pronounced dead. An investigation into the incident found that Brian Coll and two other correction officers conspired to cover up how Spear died.|$|E

50|$|Social {{media is}} a battleground for self-objectification. People {{maintain}} a social media presence {{that is different}} from their real lives. Women are able to filter what they put on their social media sites, weeding out all the less than flattering photos so that they seem to have effortless beauty, infinite happiness, and a life that is all put together. Studies show that women <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> tend <b>to</b> have a higher self-esteem than those who don't because they see their site and see themselves as beautiful. This is not necessarily a good thing, however. They feel that their social media site is something that they can control and make themselves beautiful. This is women viewing themselves as an object; an object that has good sides and bad sides; an object for someone else's viewing pleasure.|$|R
