5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
25|$|Classical deism {{held that}} a human's {{relationship}} with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through divine providence. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.|$|E

The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|R

25|$|In short, {{even though}} some {{individual}} slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that {{is very different from}} saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced {{than it would have been}} in the absence of slavery. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the...aggrandizement of slaveowners.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it}} is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address these}} issues and limitations because, as these authors state, it is a comprehensive theory of human nature, and it is an open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover truths about clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E

25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on likes. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point {{in the same direction}} (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence big is a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} discovery {{made from}} the genome sequencing, is that the coelacanths are still evolving today (but at a relatively slow rate).

2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both of these worlds (understanding and appearance), it is the world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [...] and so too of its laws.” <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the world of understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, because the world of understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because the world of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the world of appearances.|$|E

2500|$|Humanitarian aid {{is argued}} to often not reach {{those who are}} {{intended}} to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping those who need it, and may be adding to the problem. Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as ‘least developed.’ This [...] "pro-rich" [...] trend {{is not unique to}} the United States. According to Collier, [...] "the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion." [...] <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: {{the relation of}} the discrete to the continuous. Brought into light by Zeno of Elea, who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for “whole numbers represent discrete objects, and a commensurable ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects.” However Zeno found that in fact “ in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [...] appear….uantities are, in other words, continuous.” <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be infinite. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This is just what Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating four paradoxes, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno’s paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur.|$|E

50|$|With {{a larger}} target-audience group, B2M {{companies}} {{have the opportunity}} of receiving more exposure and funding. These companies receive exposure from word-of-mouth marketing (from consumers) and through various business channels (from other organizations). To add to that, while B2C offers a wider pool of customers, B2B customers are more loyal. This is because customers in B2B commerce most likely have contracts and/or other long-term agreements with the company. The switching costs are also somewhat higher in a B2B relationship, contributing to longer-lasting business-customer relations. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> a sustainable source of income to the company.
