The first goal was to develop an understanding of the flow behavior and interaction with the blades of a paddlewheel type Surface Impulse Propulsion (SIP) system operating ever a water surface. The second goal was to experimentally evaluate the effect of interblade webbing and wheel internal pressure on the thrust performance of a webbed SIP system. A series of configurations of forward speed, wheel rpm f blade immersion depth, <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> and internal wheel pressure were tested. Application of the webbing material significantly improved thrust production. Two critical parameters were the ratio of <b>web</b> <b>length</b> to blade tip to tip distance and internal system pressure. Both influenced the losses common to such a system, water entrainment at blade exit and air entrainment in the blade cavities at blade entry. Improvements of as much as 500 % were seen in thrust coefficient for the best case, and significant performance improvement was noted over a wide range of parameters. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{food web}} {{structure}} and functioning of two north-western Mediterranean lagoons exhibiting contrasting degrees of eutrophication and marine influences were compared through delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 analysis of major potential food sources and consumers. The Lapalme Lagoon is well preserved and {{has kept a}} natural and temporary connection with the open sea. Conversely, the Canet Lagoon is heavily eutrophicated and its water exchange with the open sea has been artificially reduced. In Lapalme, all potential food sources and consumers exhibited delta N- 15 values indicative of pristine coastal areas. Suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and sediment organic matter (SOM) pools seemed to constitute the main food sources of most primary consumers. Both primary producers and all consumers were much more N- 15 -enriched (by similar to 10 parts per thousand) and more C- 13 -depleted in Canet than in Lapalme. This reflected: (1) the assimilation of important amounts of anthropogenic nitrogen in the food web, and (2) a marked and uniform influence of C- 13 -depleted allochtonous sources of carbon. Based on the mean delta N- 15 of primary consumers, we found rather similar food <b>web</b> <b>lengths</b> in both lagoons with top consumers at trophic levels 3. 6 and 4. 0 in Canet and Lapalme, respectively. However, the eutrophication of the Canet Lagoon resulted in a simplification of the food web structure (i. e., a single trophic pathway from a N- 15 -enriched fraction of the SOM pool to top predators) compared to what was observed in Lapalme Lagoon where additional C- 13 -enriched food sources played a significant trophic role. Moreover, some consumers of Canet tended to exploit primary producers to a larger extent (and thus to exhibit lower trophic levels) than in Lapalm...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new proxy data bearing on Holocene paleoenvironmental {{change in the}} Gulf of Alaska region. The {{analysis}} of marine faunal frequencies in archaeological deposits, combined with paired studies of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios and mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) values in the bone collagen of Holocene-era sea otter (Enhydra lutris) remains, sheds light on changes in the marine system which may reflect wider changes in the North Pacific and Arctic climate systems. Preliminary data indicate that incidences of increased mercury in sea otters also correspond to increased δ 15 N levels. These results may have resulted from the otters foraging at a higher trophic level, such as fish, and making them more susceptible to mercury contamination. We are exploring the connection betweens food <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> ocean production and mercury bioaccumulation and consider the implication of such research for understanding human/ marine environment interactions in the past, present and future, {{especially in light of}} projected global change scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Benthic {{food web}} {{structure}} can differ over large scales across Arctic shelves {{in relation to}} hydrographic conditions, but little is known if such differences also may occur on smaller scales in hydrographically complex areas. The length, food sources, trophic composition, and energy distribution of benthic food webs in three study areas in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (i. e., Klondike, Burger, and Statoil, {{as part of the}} Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program) were compared using stable isotope analysis and bomb calorimetry. Food <b>web</b> <b>length</b> (four trophic levels), food sources, and linear models of food webs were comparable among areas. Marked differences in food web structure were observed when trophic levels were quantified by benthic biomass and abundance. High proportions of biomass and abundance of trophic level 3 taxa at Burger were attributed to high deposition of refractory material. High proportions of trophic level 1 and 2 taxa at Klondike and Statoil reflected availability of fresh material. Burger could potentially present a rich foraging ground for some benthic predators due to especially high benthic prey energy densities.

40|$|The rate of {{conversion}} from conventional vineyards to organic farming practices is increasing. Organic farming improves some soil properties, although some organic practices have negative effects on soils. The objective of this work was to study {{the long-term effects of}} organic farming through the use of soil nematodes as bio-indicators of soil processes. Our experimentation was conducted in a commercial vineyard where plots belonged to two types of viticulture: conventional viticulture and organic viticulture (for 7, 11 and 17 years). The nematode community structure and nematode indices were determined. The main result was that organic practices increased soil nematode density. An increase in the available resources, as measured by a higher enrichment index (EI), led to an increase in the microbial feeder density and mainly opportunistic fungal-feeding nematodes. A greater density of plant-feeding nematodes was attributed to the presence of a grass cover. The functioning of the soil was shifted with the decomposition channel of the soil organic matter becoming more fungal than bacterial. Even though changes were observed in the nematode community structure following the conversion, the maturity index (MI), the plant-parasitic index (PPI) and the structure index (SI) remained constant. Consequently, the organic practices did not improve the soil food <b>web</b> <b>length</b> or complexity even though the biological activity, as measured by microbial biomass and total nematode density, increased...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{in the production of}} tissue is the creping process, where the wet paper is adhered to a large drying cylinder and then peeled off the cylinder, when dried, with a doctor blade. The doctoring process changes the structure of the tissue, breaking bonds between the fibres, greatly increasing the thickness while reducing the length of the sheet and creating the soft feel of the tissue. This paper describes a laboratory scale rig that we have built to investigate the creping process. The creping rig is fed by a continuous web from an unwind stand. The web is processed by spraying the desired level of adhesive, type, concentration and volume onto an internally heated cylinder, adhering the web to the heated rotating cylinder using a presser roll, and then doctoring the web from the cylinder and rewinding. Controllable parameters include spray rate, adhesive concentration and type, cylinder temperature, rewind tension and dryer speed. Creping effectiveness is measured on-line from the reduction in <b>web</b> <b>length</b> and from the force required to doctor the sample off the cylinder. Effectiveness is also measured off-line from the change in thickness, strength and stretch of the samples. To obtain stable operation it is necessary to control the rewind tension. The solution finally chosen was to drive the rewind roll with a variable speed motor controlled from the tension from a measuring roll. It was necessary to stringently filter the adhesive to avoid full and partial plugging of the feed lines and spray nozzles. A two stage filter system was necessary, with one filter on the tank outlet and individual filters protecting each of the spray nozzles. Initial results show that crepe ratio, tensile strength, thickness and stretch all fall with increasing web tension and temperature...|$|E
40|$|Among-lake {{variation}} in mercury (Hg) concentrations in landlocked Arctic char was examined in 27 char populations from remote lakes across the Canadian Arctic. A total of 520 landlocked Arctic char {{were collected from}} 27 lakes, as well as sediments and surface water from a subset of lakes in 1999, 2002, and 2005 to 2007. Size, length, age, and trophic position (d 15 N) of individual char were determined and relationships with total Hg (THg) concentrations investigated, to identify a common covariate for adjustment using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). A subset of 216 char from 24 populations was used for spatial comparison, after length-adjustment. The influence of trophic position and food <b>web</b> <b>length</b> and abiotic characteristics such as location, geomorphology, lake area, catchment area, catchment-to-lake area ratio of the lakes on adjusted THg concentrations in char muscle tissue were then evaluated. Arctic char from Amituk Lake (Cornwallis Island) had the highest Hg concentrations (1. 31 µg/g wet wt), while Tessisoak Lake (Labrador, 0. 07 µg/g wet wt) had the lowest. Concentrations of THg were positively correlated with size, d 15 N, and age, respectively, in 88, 71, and 58 % of 24 char populations. Length and d 15 N were correlated in 67 % of 24 char populations. Food chain length did not explain the differences in length-adjusted THg concentrations in char. No relationships between adjusted THg concentrations in char and latitude or longitude were found, however, THg concentrations in char showed a positive correlation with catchment-to-lake area ratio. Furthermore, we conclude that inputs from the surrounding environment may influence THg concentrations, and will ultimately affect THg concentrations in char {{as a result of}} predicted climate-driven changes that may occur in Arctic lake watersheds...|$|E
40|$|Almost all {{engineering}} systems experience strength versus weight {{conflict of}} some description. In {{the case of}} airplane wing, there are two primary requirements which must be considered during the structural design process: high strength and stiffness, and lower weight. Due to the restricted nature of technology in this field, very few design guidelines are available for design improvement of an airplane wing structure to increase its strength-to-weight ratio. The objective of this thesis is to provide guidelines {{for the improvement of}} the structural design of a composite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wing with respect to weight, strength and bending stiffness, with Aludra MK- 01 as a case study. The finite element method was used for the numerical analysis on the structure. Popular commercial finite element software, ABAQUS CAE, was used to model the wing structure. A detailed modelling technique for composite structure and the attachment between structures was presented in this thesis. The wing finite element model was validated using experimental results. The design improvement process on the wing structures was conducted in several modes. The variables used in the process were spar <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> spar shape and spar thicknesses. UAV wing structural weight, bending stiffness and failure index were used as the main criteria in the design improvement process. The variation of these criteria with changes in selected parameters were then plotted to observe the design trends.

During the design improvement process, the failure index was found to be most sensitive towards the changes in the variable parameters compared to structural weight and bending stiffness.

40|$|The biomass, {{composition}} and size-structure of phytoplankton communities directly control many key ocean processes, such as ocean carbon cycling, food <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> trophic transfer efficiencies and biogeochemical processes. Phytoplankton communities are structured through complex interactions of bottom-up (physical processes; nutrient, light, trace metal availability) and top-down (biological processes; grazing, viral lyses, mortality) forcing that are constantly working in concert. In this dissertation I address the biomass structure and environmental relationships for phytoplankton {{communities in the}} southern California Current and adjacent ocean ecosystems. I begin by examining the microbial communities in the eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), a high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll open-ocean upwelling region, where I developed and first applied an advanced digital epifluorescence microscopy system. By combing results obtained from epifluorescence microscopy with flow cytometry (FCM) I am able to obtain a fairly complete picture of the composition, biomass and size-structure of the entire microbial community throughout the euphotic zone. My finding from the EEP show that upwelling modestly alters the phytoplankton community size-structure, giving areas with enhanced diatom and dinoflagellate biomass and also increases in nano- and pico-phytoplankton. Then I applied these same methods to investigate changes in the microbial community across a strong frontal zone in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) where the most striking features were a sharp transition between the phototrophic bacteria Prochlorococcus (PRO) and Synechococcus (SYN) and a very large (̃ 7 fold) increase in micro-sized (> 20 [mu]m) biomass directly at the front. Lastly, I compiled data on microbial communities from four disparate regions of the central to eastern North Pacific Ocean in order to investigate interregional commonalities and differences, and to test hypothesized relationships between phytoplankton size structure and total phytoplankton biomass along trophic gradients. Here I show that there are coherent patterns and variability in the phytoplankton community size-structure and composition that are clear across {{a wide range of}} trophic states and ecosystem type...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} {{faced by}} structural designers {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult as the imposed design criteria of energy absorbing structures requires weight reduction of structures without compromising cost and crushing performance. The current research is thus aimed at investigating the energy absorption of fibre reinforced composites measured {{as a function of}} geometry and scale within weight-critical structures. At the first stage, an innovative structure composed of four intersecting composite plates was tested. It was found that the structural stability {{played a crucial role in}} this intersecting structure. In order to avoid generating buckling failure before turning to a progressive crushing regime, Finite Element Method (FEM) was used on composite structures as a technical tool. At the second stage, three geometric structures containing corrugated composite laminates and possessing better structural stability were designed and examined. To increase the interlaminar fracture toughness properties of composite materials, through-thickness stitching methods were introduced. Fracture toughness (Mode-I and Mode-II) and flexure tests were performed on composite materials for comparing the effectiveness of different crushing mechanisms. Fracture toughness results presented a significant improvement of using stitching methods on Mode-I properties, while slight reduction on Mode-II properties was also detected. They also indicated the flexural properties of structural composites can significantly affect their energy absorption capabilities. At the final stage, six different factors including resin type, fibre architecture, crushing speed and stitching parameters were scaled in several levels in a modified geometric structure. An optimization approach based on Taguchi methods was utilised in order to statistically determine the relationship and assist in evaluating the contribution of each factor on crushing properties. It showed that by selecting the combinations of these factors with correct levels, the energy absorbed can be improved remarkably. It found that the crushing performance of this structural composite was mainly dominated by resin and fibre architecture, which contributed 71 % capability of energy absorption. The other 29 % capability was dominated by trigger, beam <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> edge stitching density and the crushing speed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Climate change driven {{alterations}} to {{patterns of}} Arctic marine primary production, with increasing phytoplankton- and decreasing ice algal production, {{have the potential}} to change the resource utilisation and trophic structure of the benthic communities relying on the algae for food. To predict the benthic responses to dietary changes, we studied the macroinfaunal community compositions, and used the faunal δ 13 C and δ 15 N signatures to investigate their main food sources and trophic positions in North Water (NOW) and Lancaster Sound (LS) polynyas in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Macroinfaunal density (10 952 ind. m- 2) and biomass (3190 mg C m- 2) recorded in NOW were higher than previously found in the Arctic at depths > 500 m, and significantly higher than in LS (8355 ind. m- 2 and 2110 mg C m- 2). This was attributed to higher particulate organic matter fluxes to seafloor in NOW. Polychaetes were significant taxa at both sites in terms of density and biomass, and in addition crustacean density in NOW and bivalve density in LS were high. Facultative filter and surface deposit feeders were highly prevalent at both sites, suggesting feeding plasticity is a successful strategy for accessing different food sources. The macrofaunal δ 13 C signatures reflected the signatures of pelagic particulate organic matter at the sites, and an isotope mixing model confirmed phytoplankton as the main food source for most taxa and feeding guilds. The food <b>web</b> <b>length</b> in LS was longer than in NOW (3. 2 vs. 2. 8 trophic levels). This was attributed to a larger reliance on reworked organic matter by the benthic community in LS, whereas the high export fluxes at the highly productive NOW resulted in higher rates of selective consumption of fresh algal matter. Despite studies suggesting that loss of ice algae from consumer diets in the Arctic might {{have a negative impact on}} the benthos, this study suggests that Arctic macrobenthic communities thrive using phytoplankton as their main food source and should thus be able to cope or even benefit from predicted changes to patterns of primary production...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic gear marking. The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when gear mark severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six pressruns were performed; the first three pressruns were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks. A group of thirty observers at the Rochester Institute of Technology were asked to participate in press sheet visual evaluation by ranking six sample press sheets in terms of gear mark severity. The Verity IA software was used to measure the horizontal bar defect indices on sample sheets of six pressruns for the quantitative analysis of gear mark severity. The results indicated that plate hardness and differential in surface speed affected the gear mark severity in flexography significantly. A lower plate hardness will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a higher one.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Terrestrial {{organic matter}} (OMterr) can {{function}} as a food source for Arctic marine consumers, though the relative contribution of OMterr to the structure and efficiency of marine food webs compared to marine production is unclear. Forecasted increases in OMterr inputs to the Arctic Beaufort Sea necessitate {{a better understanding of}} the proportional contribution of this organic matter source to the trophic structure of marine communities. This study investigated the relative ecological importance of OMterr across the Beaufort Sea shelf and slope by examining differences in community trophic structure concurrent with variation in terrestrial versus marine organic matter influence. Hydrogen stable isotope ratios (δD) of surface water, surface sediment particulate organic matter (sPOM), and selected benthic consumers were used as an exploratory assessment of freshwater and OMterr distribution in the Beaufort Sea. δD values of surface water confirmed the widespread influence of Canada's Mackenzie River plume across the Beaufort Sea; however, δD values of terrestrial and marine production were not sufficiently distinguishable to differentiate organic matter sources in consumers. Carbon stable isotope ratios (δ¹³C values) of pelagic particulate organic matter (pPOM) and marine consumers confirmed a significant decrease in OMterr presence and utilization by consumers with increasing distance from the Mackenzie River outflow. Food <b>web</b> <b>length,</b> based on the nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ¹⁵N values) of marine consumers, was longer closer to the Mackenzie River outflow both in shelf and slope locations due to relatively higher δ¹⁵N values of pelagic and benthic primary consumers. The absence of macrofaunal consumers at the lowest trophic levels of OMterr-influenced food webs was interpreted to result from the prior metabolic turnover of OMterr by the microbial loop, which was not sampled in this study. The inferred presence of strong microbial processing of OMterr in the eastern regions of the Beaufort Sea resulted in a higher proportion of relative epifaunal biomass occupying higher trophic levels, suggesting that OMterr as a basal food source can provide substantial energetic support for higher marine trophic levels. These findings challenge the current conception of low terrestrial matter contributions to the Arctic marine food web, and compel a more specific understanding of energy transfer through the OMterr-associated microbial loop...|$|E
40|$|Studies suggest that, {{unlike the}} {{situation}} in temperate lakes, high biomasses of omnivorous fish are maintained in subtropical and tropical lakes when they shift from a turbid phytoplankton-dominated state to a clear water macrophyte-dominated state, and the predation pressure on large-bodied zooplankton therefore remains high. Whether this reflects {{a higher degree of}} herbivory in warm lakes than in temperate lakes is debatable. We combined food web studies using stable isotopes with gut content analyses of the most dominant fish species to elucidate similarities and differences in food web structure between a clear water macrophyte-dominated basin (MDB) and a turbid phytoplankton-dominated basin (PDB) of Huizhou West Lake, a shallow tropical Chinese lake. The δ 13 C–δ 15 N biplot of fish and invertebrates revealed community-wide differences in isotope-based metrics of the food webs between MDB and PDB. The range of consumer δ 15 N (NR) was lower in MDB than in PDB, indicating shorter food <b>web</b> <b>length</b> in MDB. The mean nearest neighbor distance (MNND) and standard deviation around MNND (SDNND) were higher in MDB than in PDB, showing a markedly low fish trophic overlap and a more uneven packing of species in niches in MDB than in PDB. The range of fish δ 13 C (CR) of consumers was more extensive in MDB than in PDB, indicating a wider feeding range for fish in MDB. Mixing model results showed that macrophytes and associated periphyton constituted a large fraction of basal production sources for the fish in MDB, while particulate organic matter (POM) contributed a large fraction in PDB. In MDB, the diet of the dominant fish species, crucian carp (Carassius carassius), consisted mainly of vegetal matter (macrophytes and periphyton) and zooplankton, while detritus was the most important food item in PDB. Our results suggest that carbon from macrophytes with associated periphyton may constitute an important food resource for omnivorous fish, and this may strongly affect the feeding niche and the strength of the top-down trophic cascade between fish and zooplankton in the restored, macrophyte-dominated basin of the lake. This dual effect (consumption of macrophytes and zooplankton) may reduce the chances of maintaining the clear water state at the prevailing nutrient levels in the lake, and regular removal of large crucian carp may therefore be needed to maintain a healthy ecosystem state...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the many}} octopods {{collected}} during recent Antarctic trawling surveys were 93 specimens of an undescribed octopod with biserial suckers. Although most similar in appearance to the sub-Antarctic Benthoctopus levis (Hoyle 1885), these octopods differed in several morphological characters, including arm <b>length,</b> <b>web</b> depth, and {{details of the}} hectocotylus. Furthermore, molecular evidence supports {{the separation of the}} present material from known species. We therefore describe a new species named Benthoctopus rigbyae. These octopods attain mantle lengths of at least 105 mm (400 mm total length), and they are common at depths of 250 - 600 m throughout the South Shetland Island chain off the Antarctic Peninsula. We present some information on the biology of this species...|$|R
40|$|With {{evolving}} <b>Web,</b> short <b>length</b> parallel corpora {{is becoming}} very common {{and some of}} these include user queries, web snippets etc. This paper concerns situations where short length parallel corpora has to be analyzed in order to find meaningful unit-alignment. This is similar to dealing with parallel corpora where a sentence level alignment of translations is required, but differs in that the alignment is to be inferred at unit (word or phrase) level. A Conditional Random Field (CRF) based approach is proposed to discover this unit alignment. Given pairs of semantically or syntactically similar entities, the problem is formulated as that of mutual segmentation and sequence alignment problem. The mutual segmentation refers to the process of segmenting the first entity based on units (or labels) in the second entity and vice-versa. The process of optimizing this mutual segmentation also results in optimal unit alignment. Since our training data is not segmented and unit-aligned, we modify the CRF objective function to accommodate unsupervised data and iterative learning. We have applied this framework to Web Search domain and specifically for query reformulation task. Finally, our experiments suggest that the proposed approach indeed results in meaningful alternatives of the original query. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} the practical design modification {{to improve the}} retracting performance of the pyro-typed high power pretensioner. 3 components of the pretensioner are redesigned and {{the usefulness of the}} design modification is verified by the experiment. During the pretensioning process, the gas blast generated from the gunpowder is transferred to the rack-pinion gear through the manifold. The rack-pinion gear is connected with the spool where the webbing is rolled up. According to the rotation of the pinion, the spool is turned and the webbing is winded. To help the gas blast flow well, the shape of the inner cross section of the manifold is changed. The spur gear design program is developed and used to find the best combination of the rack-pinion gear pair to increase the power transmission efficiency. The pinion guide is installed on the spool to prevent the vibration of the pinion. As a result of the experiment, the amount of the <b>web</b> retraction <b>length</b> is increased when every single design modification is applied. Therefore, the retracting performance of the pretensioner is considered to be improved if the presented design modifications are applied.
