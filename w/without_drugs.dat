Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health <b>without</b> <b>drugs.</b> He also promoted hydrotherapy and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra.

25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high <b>without</b> <b>drugs.</b> According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E

We specify a model of plan entry and benefit choice and Medicare enrollee plan choice and health outcomes. We derive an estimator that is consistent with endogenous plan selection by using the quasi-experimental variation caused by peculiarities of the Medicare reimbursement system for HMOs. We find that, relative to traditional Medicare, enrollment in an HMO <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> coverage increases mortality while enrollment in an HMO with drug coverage has no significant impact.

40|$|Wild {{waterfowl}} is {{the natural}} reservoir of influenza A virus (IAV); hosted viruses are very variable and provide a source for genetic segments which can reassort with poultry or mammalian adapted IAVs to generate novel species crossing viruses. Additionally, wild waterfowl act as a reservoir for highly pathogenic IAVs. Exposure of wild birds to the antiviral drug oseltamivir may occur in the environment as its active metabolite can be released from sewage treatment plants to river water. Resistance to oseltamivir, or to other neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), in IAVs of wild waterfowl has not been extensively studied. In a previous in vivo Mallard experiment, an influenza A(H 6 N 2) virus developed oseltamivir resistance by the R 292 K substitution in the neuraminidase (NA), when the birds were exposed to oseltamivir. In this study we tested if the resistance could be maintained in Mallards <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> exposure. Three variants of resistant H 6 N 2 /R 292 K virus were each propagated during 17 days in five successive pairs of na√Øve Mallards, while oseltamivir exposure was decreased and removed. Daily fecal samples were analyzed for viral presence, genotype and phenotype. Within three days <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> exposure no resistant viruses could be detected by NA sequencing, which was confirmed by functional NAI sensitivity testing. We conclude that this resistant N 2 virus could not compete in fitness with wild type subpopulations <b>without</b> oseltamivir <b>drug</b> pressure, and thus has no potential to circulate among wild birds. The {{results of this study}} contrast to previous observations of drug induced resistance in an avian H 1 N 1 virus, which was maintained also <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> exposure in Mallards. Experimental observations on persistence of NAI resistance in avian IAVs resemble NAI resistance seen in human IAVs, in which resistant N 2 subtypes do not circulate, while N 1 subtypes with permissive mutations can circulate <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> pressure. We speculate that the phylogenetic group N 1 NAs may easier compensate for NAI resistance than group N 2 NAs, though further studies are needed to confirm such conclusions...|$|R

2500|$|Issues of self-deception {{arise when}} {{altering}} memories as well. Avoiding {{the pain and}} difficulty of dealing with a memory by taking a drug {{may not be an}} honest method of coping. Instead of dealing with the truth of the situation a new altered reality is created where the memory is dissociated from pain, or the memory is forgotten altogether. Another issue that arises is exposing patients to unnecessary risk. Traumatic experiences do not necessarily produce a long term traumatic memory, some individuals learn to cope and integrate their experience and it stops affecting their lives quite quickly. If drug treatments are administered when not needed, as when a person could learn to cope <b>without</b> <b>drugs,</b> they may be exposed to side effects and other risks without cause. [...] Loss of painful memories may actually end up causing more harm in some cases. Painful, frightening or even traumatic memories can serve to teach a person to avoid certain situations or experiences. By erasing those memories their adaptive function, to warn and protect individuals may be lost. Another possible result of this technology is a lack of tolerance. If the suffering induced by traumatic events were removable, people may become less sympathetic to that suffering, and put more social pressure on others to erase the memories.|$|E

40|$|A Leptomonas {{of insect}} origin was highly {{susceptible}} to several standard trypanocides and leishmanicides in vitro. Resistance was induced {{to some of}} these drugs; clones were isolated from each strain. Cross-resistance patterns of the clones were derived for diamidines, quinapyramine (Antrycide), acriflavin, phenanthridines, and other drugs active against trypanosomes and leishmanias. Clones tested included two each that were resistant to acriflavin, Antrycide, diminazene aceturate (Berenil), and pentamidine and one that was resistant to stilbamidine. Appreciable cross-resistance was evident for all clones. Differences were observed between clones from the same parent strain. Collateral susceptibility towards isometamidium and oxophenarsine was detected in most clone-derived populations. In clones passaged <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> to test for drug fastness, acriflavin and pentamidine clones lost resistance within 10 transfers, whereas Berenil and Antrycide clones retained considerable resistance after 20 to 30 subcultures <b>without</b> <b>drug.</b> Considerations of differences in life cycles suggest that the clone collection may be useful in screening for agents effective against leishmanias and stercorarian trypanosomes rather than against salivary trypanosomes...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objective: Acute {{generalized}} exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is {{a severe}} cutaneous {{adverse drug reaction}} characterized by fever and numerous sterile non-follicular pustules. It is mainly attributed to drugs, although other factors have been implicated. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical and histological features of AGEP in a Taiwanese population. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed patients diagnosed with AGEP with a EuroSCAR (RegiSCAR) validation score more than 4 (> 4, probable to definite cases), between 1992 and 2012 at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, pathologic findings, and disease causality were analyzed. Results: A total of 51 patients were included in this study, with 34 (66. 7 %) patients being diagnosed with AGEP with drug causality, and 17 (33. 3 %) patients being diagnosed with AGEP <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> causality. Cases of AGEP with drug causality showed an older average age, and a significantly higher rate of previous drug hypersensitivity history compared to cases of AGEP <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> causality (p¬†=¬† 0. 0018). None of the patients had a history of psoriasis or had developed psoriasis at the 1 -year follow-up. A total of 12 cases (23. 5 %) had systemic involvement, including liver and kidneys. Penicillin or aminopenicillin (17. 6 %) and cephalosporins (17. 6 %) were the most common causative drug groups related to AGEP. In AGEP patients <b>without</b> <b>drug</b> causality, three cases of pathogen infections were identified (1 case of mycoplasma, Coxsackie virus, and Epstein-Barr virus, respectively). Conclusion: We found that beta-lactam antibiotics were the major drug class responsible for inducing AGEP in a Taiwanese population, but that some infectious pathogens may also contribute to AGEP development...|$|R
