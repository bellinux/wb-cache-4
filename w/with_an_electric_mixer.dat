With each additive, PCWSs were prepared at four different pH values (i.e., pH 5, 7, 9 and 11). The pH values were measured by using an E 200 Portable pH Meter (Mont, China).|$|E
40|$|Armstrong’s {{two-dimensional}} paper chromatographic {{method for}} VMA estimation has been adapted to thin-layer chromatography. DAPTING Armstrong’s two-dimensional paper chromatographic nlethod for VMA estimation (1 - 3) to thin-layer chromatography of-fers {{the advantages of}} increased sensitivity, considerably shortened analytical time, and reduced space needs. This report presents details of the technic. Method Layer the plates (200 X 200 mm.) with an aqueous slurry of MN-cellulose powder, 300 0, made by stirring 15 gm. into 110 ml. of de-mineralized water until lump-free (about 5 mm. <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer).</b> Apply the slurry with the applicator set at 0. 5 -mm. thickness. Keep the plates in a horizontal position for 15 mill., and then dry them for 10 mm. at 110 #{ 176 }. Before using the prepared plates draw two pencil lines on each as indicated in Fig. 1. Make the usual ethyl acetate extract of that volume of urine contain-ing 1 mg. of creatinine as reported elsewhere (2, 3). Dissolve the dry residue in 1 ml. of absolute ethanol, and apply 25,l. (equivalent to 0. 025 mg. creatinine) to one plate and 100 /Ll. (equivalent to 0. 1 mg. creatinine) to another (Spot A, Fig. 1).

30|$|Enrichment with vitamin C is {{the second}} step to {{enrichment}} with HUFAs. Therefore, in order to enrich the live food with vitamins, fatty acid emulsion was used as carrier of this component. Fatty acid emulsion was prepared and 10 % of Ascorbyl palmitate w/w {{was added to the}} fatty acid emulsion (Treece, 2000). Mixing was done using <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> until the vitamin C is dissolved. The emulsion containing vitamin C was preserved in refrigerator until use. Nauplii were enriched with two doses of this mixture at 0 and 18  h during the process of enrichment.|$|R
50|$|In Greece, one of {{the most}} popular coffees is a {{variation}} of iced coffee called Frappé, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957. The preparation entails instant coffee (traditionally Nescafe), water, and optionally, sugar, together using either <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or <b>a</b> shaker to create a foam. Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-frappe18aug18,1,6434354.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-food Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.|$|R
5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic [...] "cake" [...] mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, under Father Carroll's {{direction}} {{and based on}} his experience with blinded servicemen, the Guild founded St. Paul's Rehabilitation Center for newly blinded Adults on the Guild's grounds. [...] Prior to this, the Guild consisted of St. Raphael's Hall, which was primarily {{a safe haven for}} elderly blind women. At St. Paul, all of the blind, including the elderly, were taught to do {{as much as they could}} do for themselves. The name of the hall (as part of St. Paul's) was changed to St. Raphael's Geriatric Adjustment Center for the Blind and the Visually handicapped. Skills taught included operating power tools including a buzz saw, and cooking using <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> and gas stove. In addition to building skills, each blind person developed confidence and independence.|$|R
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by hand <b>with</b> <b>a</b> whisk, or fork, or {{with the}} aid of <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to {{disperse}} the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|R
50|$|In 1908 Herbert Johnson, an {{engineer}} for the Hobart Manufacturing Company, invented <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> standing <b>mixer.</b> His inspiration came from observing a baker mixing bread dough <b>with</b> <b>a</b> metal spoon; {{soon he was}} toying <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mechanical counterpart. By 1915, his 20 gallon (80 l) mixer was standard equipment for most large bakeries. In 1919, Hobart introduced the Kitchen Aid Food Preparer (stand mixer) for the home.|$|R
50|$|After a while, Marc Anthony {{takes the}} kitten {{into the kitchen}} and {{attempts}} to scold it, but when he hears his owner walking toward the kitchen, he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner evicts him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies. Marc Anthony watches as his owner scoops out a cup of flour, and is horrified to see that the kitten is in the measuring cup. The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> The bulldog tries several times to thwart her, finally spraying his face with whipped cream to make himself appear rabid, resulting in his disbelieving and exasperated owner throwing him out of the house. Meanwhile, the kitten climbs out of the bowl and hides behind a box of soap flakes to clean itself up.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{described}} indicating that a vaccine containing approximately 50, 000 mouse intracerebral lethal doses of rabies virus properly irradiated will immunize mice, and that 25, 000, 000 doses will immunize dogs against a subsequent test inoculation of virulent virus. Additional experiments showed that a volume of 0. 1 cc. of an irradiated vaccine prepared from the supernatant of centrifuged virus-containing dog brain contained the required 50, 000 doses and immunized mice adequately (1). It remained {{to determine whether the}} required number of mouse doses to immunize dogs could b concentrated into a small volume and whether a single injection of such a va~ cine would in fact protect them adequately. Technique To prepare vaccine, 2 -months-old beagle dogs are injected intracerebrally with 0. 5 cc. of a 1 : 10 dilution of dog brain virus, Pasteur strain.
