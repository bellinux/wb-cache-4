40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of mobile communication, <b>wireless</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> are {{becoming}} a significant consumer of compu-tational resources. Historically, <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> have been built from ASICs, DSP processors, or FPGAs. This paper studies the feasibility of building <b>wireless</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> from com-mercial graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are attrac-tive because they are widely used massively parallel devices that can be programmed in a high level language. Base sta-tion workloads are highly parallel, making GPUs a potential candidate for a cost effective programmable solution. In this work, we develop parallel implementations of key kernels to evaluate the merits of using GPUs as the baseband signal pro-cessor. We show that the digital processing subsystem for a 75 Mbps LTE <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can be built using two NVIDIA GTX 680 GPUs with power consumption of 188 W.
