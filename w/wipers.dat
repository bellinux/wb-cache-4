40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for self-excited vibration of an automotive <b>wiper.</b> The self-excited vibration is generated by a stick-slip motion. It is of practical importance to suppress the self-excited vibration of the <b>wiper.</b> To find out modal coupling in the vibration of the <b>wiper,</b> simplified <b>wiper</b> is constructed. Movement of simplified <b>wiper</b> is separated into horizontal and vertical directions to simulate a motion of the actual <b>wiper.</b> The simplified <b>wiper</b> and the actual <b>wiper</b> are used for experiments. Static deformation of a <b>wiper</b> blade is measured. The blade is pressed on a glass surface. The <b>wiper</b> blade shows characteristics of soft-hardening spring involving a buckled deformation. Modal coupling in the self-excited vibration is examined by sweeping the <b>wiper</b> on a rotating glass table with constant angular velocity. Increasing a load pressed on the blade, coupling vibration is generated due to self-excitations along glass surface and parametric movements in vertical direction. The vibration amplitude is suppressed extremely when the load {{is close to the}} buckling load. Moreover, the maximum Lyapnov exponent of the dynamic response shows least number of the modes contributed to the self-excited vibration...|$|R

40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive windscreen <b>wiper</b> {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the <b>wiper</b> concern operation noise. <b>Wiper</b> vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the <b>wiper</b> reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive windscreen <b>wiper</b> has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive windscreen <b>wiper</b> using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual <b>wiper</b> components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car windscreen <b>wiper.</b> Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the windscreen <b>wiper</b> assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real windscreen <b>wiper.</b> In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the windscreen <b>wiper,</b> complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the windscreen <b>wiper</b> generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the <b>wiper</b> blade. Having found the characteristics of the windscreen <b>wiper</b> noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the windscreen <b>wiper.</b> This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective windscreen <b>wiper</b> and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} <b>wipers</b> {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a feasibility study on dither control for automotive <b>wiper</b> squeal. <b>Wiper</b> squeal is a tonal noise {{caused by an}} unstable vibration due to the friction between <b>wiper</b> blade and windscreen. Dither control is the superposition of a high-frequency signal, {{in this case a}} high-frequency vibration, to stabilize a low-frequency unstability in a system. A finite element model of the <b>wiper</b> has been developed to facilitate the choice and design of an actuator system; piezo actuators are applied on the <b>wiper</b> to apply the dither signal. First experimental results show that <b>wiper</b> squeal can effectively be suppressed by dither control, as soon as the dither amplitude reaches a certain threshold value. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{automotive}} industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances {{in the development of}} safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of distractions, automatic rain-sensing <b>wiper</b> systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel.
