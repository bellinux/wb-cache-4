5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> {{electromagnetic}} radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5000|$|These {{vertically}} propagating mixed Rossby-gravity waves {{were first}} {{observed in the}} stratosphere as westward-propagating mixed waves by M. Yanai.

30|$|It {{shall be}} noted that the SH {{expansion}} of the anomaly field of a lithospheric model is not the SH expansion of this model. In particular, these two SH expansions {{do not have the same}} SH degree bounds. As a result, the long <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> the WDMAM data are different from the long <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field model GRIMM_L 120.

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> light and emits light that {{bypasses}} broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which {{coincides with the}} vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact.

40|$|Gravity waves (GWs) with {{horizontal}} <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 32 - 2000 km are investigated during {{tropical cyclone}} (TC) Ivan (2008) {{in the southwest}} Indian Ocean in the upper troposphere (UT) and the lower stratosphere (LS) using observational data sets, radiosonde and GPS radio occultation data, ECMWF analyses and simulations of the French numerical model Meso-NH with vertical resolution < 150 m near the surface and 500 m in the UT/LS. Observations reveal dominant low-frequency GWs with short vertical <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 0. 7 - 3 km, horizontal <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 80 - 400 km and periods of 4. 6 - 13 h in the UT/LS. Continuous wavelet transform and image-processing tools highlight {{a wide spectrum of}} GWs with horizontal <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 40 - 1800 km, short vertical <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 0. 6 - 3. 3 km and periods of 20 min- 2 days from modelling analyses. Both ECMWF and Meso-NH analyses are consistent with radiosonde and GPS radio occultation data, showing evidence of a dominant TC-related quasi-inertia GW propagating eastward east of TC Ivan with horizontal and vertical <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 400 - 800 km and 2 - 3 km respectively in the LS, more intense during TC intensification. In addition, the Meso-NH model produces a realistic, detailed description of TC dynamics, some high-frequency GWs near the TC eye, variability of the tropospheric and stratospheric background wind and TC rainband characteristics at different stages of TC Ivan. A wave number 1 vortex Rossby wave is suggested as a source of dominant inertia GW with horizontal <b>wavelengths</b> <b>of</b> 400 - 800 km, while shorter scale modes (100 - 200 km) located at northeast and southeast of the TC could be attributed to strong localized convection in spiral bands resulting from wave number 2 vortex Rossby waves. Meso-NH simulations also reveal GW-related clouds east of TC Ivan...|$|R

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a <b>wavelength</b> <b>of</b> 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules.
