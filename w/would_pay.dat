5|$|In December 1999, a {{disagreement}} arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city; {{the city would}} not except the government's promise to finance part of the line. Both Minister of Transport and Communications, Dag Jostein Fjærvoll from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment, Merete Agerbak-Jensen from the Conservative Party, agreed upon the distribution of funding {{from the city and}} state, and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible. The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000. Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> NOK 224 million, while the state <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> NOK 673 million.|$|E

Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E

The fountain was shut off again {{during the winter of}} 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{city and}} state then had to provide a location, {{and one of the}} {{promises}} the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The {{city and state}} reached an agreement whereby the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> for the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> for the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Château-Thierry.|$|E
