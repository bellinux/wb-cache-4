5|$|A three-strong EC {{delegation}} {{made three}} {{visits to the}} region in late June and early July to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The delegation consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the EC presidency, and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office. The delegation members were Jacques Poos (Luxembourg), Gianni de Michelis (Italy), and Hans van den Broek (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation's arrival in Belgrade, Poos told reporters that the EC would {{take charge of the}} crisis. There, the delegation <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> Serbian president Slobodan Milošević who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 Serbs.|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> recycled germanium.|$|E
5|$|After {{some months}} of travel, Heraclius entered Constantinople in triumph and <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> {{the people of}} the city, his son Heraclius Constantine, and Patriarch Sergius, prostrating {{themselves}} in joy. His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade went toward the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically towered over the high altar. To many, this was a sign that a new golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|Darius thus put {{together}} an ambitious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC, which attacked Naxos, before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed. Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of Marathon, where it <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, {{which resulted in the}} withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. Different versions of the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E

Callaghan took a throw-in, which he threw to Lawler, his cross into the Leeds penalty area <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> Hunt, but his header went wide of the goal. Liverpool {{continued}} to pressure and only an interception from Bremner, before Stevenson could reach the ball, prevented a Liverpool goal. Leeds had a free-kick a few minutes later, but Giles' effort was saved by Lawrence. A few minutes later, St. John found Peter Thompson, who ran past Bremner and shot, but it was diverted wide by Sprake. The ball found dropped to hunt, but his cross was gathered by the Leeds goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack.

Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. The last chance of the half came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however his shot went out for a throw-in.|$|E
5|$|In 226 BC, the {{citizens}} of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the citadel and removed the Achaean garrison. The king reinstated the ancient laws {{of the city and}} returned to Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.|$|E

Canada's obligation <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra Pratap {{was head}} of the Indian princely states of Mursan and Hathras. He had been {{involved}} with the Indian National Congress in the 1900s, attending the Congress session of 1906. He toured the world in 1907 and 1911, and in 1912 contributed substantial funds to Gandhi's South African movement. Pratap left India for Geneva {{at the beginning of the}} war, where he <b>was</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> Virendranath Chattopadhyaya of the Berlin Committee. Chattopadhyaya's efforts—along with a letter from the Kaiser—convinced Pratap to lend his support to the Indian nationalist cause, on the condition that the arrangements were made with the Kaiser himself. A private audience with the Kaiser was arranged, at which Pratap agreed to nominally head the expedition.|$|E
