25|$|Next, Chris Jericho {{defended the}} United States Championship against Kevin Owens. Owens {{attempted}} a pop-up powerbomb on Jericho, who countered and performed a Lionsault on Owens for a near-fall. Owens applied the Walls of Jericho on Jericho, who escaped. Owens performed a pop-up powerbomb on Jericho for a near-fall. As Owens attempted a second pop-up powerbomb on Jericho, Jericho countered into a Codebreaker on Owens, who touched the ring ropes <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> to void the pinfall at a two count. In the end, Owens performed a powerbomb onto the ring apron on Jericho and pinned {{him to win}} his first United States Championship.|$|E
25|$|Competitors race either {{individually}} or in {{teams in the}} manner of a relay race. If the egg falls from the spoon then competitors may be required to stop, retrieve, and reposition their egg; or to start again; or may even be disqualified. Due to the lesser penalty imposed for dropping the egg, and consequent encouragement of greater risk-taking, the first penalty scenario may result in a race that is faster overall. Common methods of cheating include sticking the egg to the spoon, or holding onto the egg <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger.</b> For an extra challenge, contestants might carry the spoon with both hands, with their teeth, or have their hands tied behind their backs.|$|E

25|$|Removing {{contact lenses}} {{incorrectly}} {{could result in}} damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. <b>With</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins {{against the edge of}} lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger.</b> It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

500|$|Rihanna first {{performed}} [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol on April 7, 2010. She {{wore a black}} PVC catsuit and {{was accompanied}} on stage by guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the set design included flame throwers and a video screen which showed guitars, lightning bolts and skulls. At one point, the singer picked and played up a black Gibson Flying V guitar. Larry Carroll for MTV wrote that the extent of Rihanna's ability to play the guitar was limited to playing it <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> {{on one of the}} strings. However, he complimented Rihanna's overall performance, writing that her shoulder pads were [...] "nearly as huge as her presence". He went on to write that she [...] "half-sung, half-spoke" [...] the song. A reviewer for MTV UK agreed with Carroll, writing that [...] "halfway through the performance [...] donned a 'black flying v guitar' although we're not sure you could say she 'played' it!" [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone praised Rihanna's performance, writing [...] "if the introductory rules of rock stardom are 'teach thyself to pick slide,' 'tight clothes' and 'pyro!' then Rihanna has been paying attention in her 'Rockstar 101' classes after all".|$|E
500|$|Garran {{developed}} {{a strong relationship}} with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the World War I conscription plebiscites and on the range of regulations which were made under the War Precautions Act 1914. The War Precautions Regulations had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to {{the reach of the}} Commonwealth's defence power during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy Central Powers living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a German man, the band had played [...] "Das Lied der Deutschen", Hughes asked Garran [...] "By the way, what is this tune?" [...] to which Garran replied that it was Haydn's melody to [...] "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser", and as it was used as the tune to several hymns [...] "it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday." [...] Hughes then said [...] "Good Heavens! I have played that thing <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> hundreds of times." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. Did {{he do that}} because it {{made it easier to}} play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger.</b> So I took every bass line and learned how to do it <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger,</b> and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger,</b> you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

50|$|Snapping (or clicking) <b>one's</b> <b>fingers</b> is {{the act of}} {{creating}} a snapping or clicking sound <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>fingers.</b> Primarily this is done by building tension between the thumb and another (middle, index, or ring) finger and then moving the other finger forcefully downward so it hits the palm of the same hand at a high speed. Alternatively, one can press the middle finger and thumb together and then fling the middle finger onto your palm.|$|R
5000|$|Pimple-popping, or Zit-popping, is {{the act of}} {{bursting}} or popping pimples <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>finger.</b> Pimple-popping {{can lead}} to the introduction of bacteria into the pimple, infection, the creation of more pimples, and permanent scarring. Thus, popping is usually deprecated by dermatologists and estheticians and it is recommended to let the pimples run through their life span.|$|R
2500|$|Vibrato {{is a small}} {{oscillation}} in {{the pitch}} of a note, usually considered expressive. Harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes {{that are part of}} the harmonic series on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{work had}} its genesis in a {{commission}} from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel {{to make an}} orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that the movements had already been orchestrated by Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, {{he said he would}} happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. However, Ravel changed his mind and decided initially to orchestrate one of his own works. He then changed his mind again and decided to write a completely new piece based on the musical form and Spanish dance called bolero. While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>finger</b> to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying [...] "Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality? I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can." [...] This piece was initially called Fandango, but its title was soon changed to [...] "Boléro". According to Idries Shah the main melody is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.|$|E
