In 1912 all Chief Constables had been given authority by Government to start a Special Constables unit, which Richardson used to the full in Halifax during the First World War. In the early 1930s he had introduced new uniforms, instructions and ID cards etc. to upgrade their status. He now re-organised the Halifax Special Constables Force on the 'outlying residential unit' basis he had previously set up. There was opposition from the Watch Committee to activate this, but it went ahead were proved later {{to be a great}} success. A leaflet dated 11 January 1940 regarding Police and Special Constable equipment and uniforms which included a list of Wartime aids for Animal Owners, was issued from the Chief Constables Office and sent to the thirteen outlying Residential Units. His role, {{within the framework of the}} Watch Committee, are noted in a series of Committee reports from 8 December 1937 to 22 June 1939. There was a National [...] "Safety First Congress".

50|$|McDonoghville stradled {{what is now}} the West Bank {{boundary}} between Jefferson Parish and Orleans Parish. The portion on the Orleans side was absorbed into Algiers and thence into New Orleans, while the portion on the Jefferson side was absorbed into Gretna in 1913. The original inhabitants of McDonoghville were free people of color to whom John McDonogh bestowed or rented the land. The current leaders of Gretna have ignored this part of the area's history largely due to the continuing corrosive residue of the JIm Crow past that caused a <b>white</b> <b>washing</b> of history. Among the original families of color were the Roches, Lombards, Carmouches, Millauds, Bordenaves, and Labostries. Irish, Italian and German immigrants were the first New Orleanians to populate McDonogh in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city's robust economic growth from trade increased population and immigrants fled to the West bank to relieve the increasingly crowded East bank.Excellent ferry service to the East bank's Faubourg St. Mary (now the CBD), Vieux Carre, and Marigny neighborhoods facilitated the growth of this neighborhood during this period.|$|E

While Sunnis regard Umar ibn al-Khattab in high esteem and respect his place as one of the [...] "Four Righteously Guided Caliphs", Shia do not view him as a legitimate leader of the Ummah and believe that Umar and Abu Bakr conspired to usurp power from Ali. Shia believe that the Sunni view of Umar was created by the later Umayyad dynasty to honour the man that gave power to the first Umayyad ruler and third Sunni Caliph, Uthman. In this way, it gives legitimacy to Umar's consultation that started their own dynasty. Shia believe that the Umayyad view was propagated with lethal force and heavy duress and as time went on, that view became predominant and eventually taken as truth, cemented by the works of Bukhari. However, Shi'a believe that despite the perceived <b>white</b> <b>washing</b> of Umar, bits of his true qualities can be found in all sources, including Sunni ones. They also believe that invented positive traits attributed to him do not hold up to closer scrutiny.|$|E

5000|$|In Ghana, {{the ghosts}} of colonialism, white supremacy, and imperialism still linger in their society, {{whiteness}} is seen as superior and the goal, creating a Trope of Whiteness. There's an initial distrust of white people, but also a need to become white and assimilate into white culture. In the book, The Predicament of Blackness: Postcolonial Ghana and the Politics of Race, the author Jemima Pierre speaks {{to a group of}} Ghanaian college students about how they view white people and white influence. Many of the college students had an almost God-like view of white people, calling them [...] "demigods" [...] or [...] "mini-gods", the University students also pointed out that they treat white people better than their fellow Ghanians despite an initial distrust for white people, and this is because the students see white people as more successful, more advanced, more educated, and are leading in almost all industries[...] This Trope of Whiteness {{is one of the many}} lasting impacts of colonialism in Ghana, and because of white supremacy and internalized racism it is almost ingrained in the minds of many Ghanians that white people are better and/or smarter. The idea that [...] "whiteness is the ownership of the Earth" [...] , goes hand in hand with the Trope of Whiteness in Ghana, Ghanians are exposed to Eurocentric beauty standards and even the <b>white</b> <b>washing</b> of religion is ingrained in the minds of many Ghanians.|$|E
5000|$|The {{southern}} part of Glatved Beach is dominated by a man made plain, originating from limestone extraction going back at least 150 years. The plain consists of now fairly levelled out heaps of stones, that up until the fifties where dumped from rail-wagons coming from an industrial lime kiln {{at the southern end}} of the beach, after the lime-stones had been sorted out. The kiln was placed at the end of Katholm Strandvej. In the sea out from Glatved Beach, are the remains of a 65-million-year-old cold water coral reef, consisting of a limestone formation with layers of flint. This reef is the source of the stony coast of Glatved, and the hills behind. This underground lime-formation stretches throughout the Danish underground, and is also exposed at The Cliffs of Møn (Møns Klint) on the south-eastern island of Denmark, Møn. Here there are coastal cliffs similar to the Cliffs of Dover in England. The formation also surfaces as The Cliffs of Sangstrup, Sangstrup Clint, 20 km north of Glatved Beach in the middle of Denmark, and again in the northeren part of the country south of the town, Aalborg. Here the lime is extracted as an ingredient for cement production. The industrial lime kiln at Glatved Strandvej was torn down around year 2000. At the furnace here, limestone was burned and converted into calcium oxide, burnt lime, which in the form of slaked lime was used for mortar production and for <b>white</b> <b>washing</b> of buildings - a widespread surface treatment for masonry in the past, seen on traditional white washed Danish country Churhes, and on many old and white washed farms and houses in the Danish countryside. [...] Today only gravel and stones are extracted from the hills behind Glatved Beach. At the end of Glatved Strandvej is a pier for embarkment of this raw material.|$|E

Today there are strikingly few substantial roles for Black actors and actresses, few young-adult novels either written or featuring Black bodies, and an alarmingly small amount of Black writers, producers, and directors working to produce today’s media.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 In fall of 2014, the College Board {{released}} a new Advanced Placement United States History (APUSH) framework written {{over seven years}} {{by a panel of}} professional historians. By shifting the focus of the framework from content mastery to critical inquiry, the authors hoped to bring the course more in line with college level expectations. Prominent Conservatives, however, condemned the 2014 framework and accused the College Board of seeking to indoctrinate students with leftist identity politics. Conservative pushback caused the College Board to reevaluate the 2014 framework, resulting in an updated 2015 edition. This caused an angry outpouring from media on the Left accusing the College Board of caving to Conservative pressure and <b>white</b> <b>washing</b> the United State’s checkered past. This paper argues that by positioning the new APUSH frameworks in terms of a Liberal-Conservative binary, the media coverage obscured the larger focus in both the 2014 and 2015 frameworks on the importance of dialogue and critical thinking skills in history classrooms. In contrast to the media portrayal of the new frameworks, this paper asserts that the 2014 and 2015 APUSH editions open the door for students to engage with the complexities of historical invention by presenting students with an understanding of the past as indeterminate and open to dialogue. By positioning the frameworks as promoting either Liberal or Conservative history, the media coverage inhibits effective public discussion and understanding of these reforms...|$|E
