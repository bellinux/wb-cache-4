A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> shall have all the more strength to fight them."

[...] Terkel goes on: [...] "The suburb, until 1946, had been the exclusive domain of the 'upper class.' It was where the rich lived. The rest of us were neighborhood folk. At war's end, a new kind of suburb came into being[...] [...] [...] Thanks to the GI bill, two new names were added to American folksay: Levittown and Park Forest. [...] "A new middle class had emerged. Until now, the great many, even before the Depression, had had to scuffle from one payday to the next[...] [...] [...] there had only been one car on the block. Now everybody was getting a car. Oh, it was exciting. (Terkel, p. 12)" ...|$|R

He told me frankly enough that his father was a clergyman who would have taught him well, but that he, Will Atkins, despised all instruction and correction; and by his brutish conduct cut the thread of all his father's comforts and shortened his days, for that he broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return for the most affectionate treatment a father ever gave.|$|R

6000|$|After supper we {{went outside}} {{in order to}} escape the feet-washing {{ceremony}} (all in the same water) which this [...] "simple pastoral people" [...] are said to indulge in, and which they might expect the [...] "uitlander" [...] (stranger) to enter into with enthusiasm. When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> found that the women--who, by-the-by, do not eat till the men have finished--had done their meal, and gone to bed, having first made us up a luxurious couch on the floor, consisting of a filthy feather-bed, and an equally filthy blanket. My heart misgave me when I looked at that bed. It may have been fancy, but once or twice I thought it moved. However, there was no choice, unless we chose to sit up all night; so in we got, looking {{for all the world}} like three big sun-burned dolls put to bed by some little girl. I, as the youngest, blew out the light, and then!--from every side they came. Up one's arms, up one's legs, down one's back they scampered, till life became a burden. Sleep was impossible; one could only lie awake and calculate the bites per minute, and the quantity of blood one would lose before daybreak. Cold as it was, I would have turned out and slept in the veldt, only my rug was over my two companions as well as myself, so I could not take it. I have slept in a good many different places, and in very fairly uncomfortable places, but I never had such a night before.|$|R

Well, Paul and I ran about seven miles, we ran and ran, just so we could stop and have a joint before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> <b>We</b> could have run all the way to Switzerland. If you look at pictures of us you can see a lot of red-eyed shots; they were red from the dope we were smoking. And these were those clean-cut boys! Dick Lester knew that very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script. We had such hysterics that no one could do anything. Dick Lester would say, 'No, boys, could we do it again?' It was just that we had a lot of fun - a lot of fun in those days." [...] Ringo Starr ...|$|R
60|$|The church itself {{we found}} very clean, and of an {{interest}} quite beyond {{the promise of}} the rather bare outside. A painted window above the door cast a glare of fresh red and blue over the interior, and over the comfortably matted floor; and there was a quite freshly carved and gilded chapel which the pleasant youth supplementing our policeman for the time said was done by artists still living in Tarifa. The edifice was of a very flamboyant Gothic, with clusters of slender columns and a vault brilliantly swirled over with decorations of the effect of peacock feathers. But above all there was on a small side altar a figure of the Child Jesus dressed in the corduroy suit and felt hat of a Spanish shepherd, with a silver crook in one hand and leading a toy lamb by a string in the other. Our young guide took the image down for us to look at, and showed its shepherd's dress with peculiar satisfaction; and then he left it on the ground while he went to show us something else. When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>we</b> found two small boys playing with the Child, putting its hat off and on, and feeling of its clothes. Our guide took it from them, not unkindly, and put it back on the altar; and whether the reader will agree with me or not, I must own that I did not find the incident irreverent or without a certain touchingness, as if those children and He were all of one family and they were at home with Him there.|$|R

5000|$|... "Dancin' in the Streets" [...] is a {{cover of}} Martha & the Vandellas' [...] "Dancing in the Street" [...] {{from the early days}} of the band, given a new {{arrangement}} that prominently features singer Donna Godchaux. For the studio version, a funk-influenced guitar figure was added to a four-on-the-floor disco beat and polished with a commercial production contemporary to the era. The highly orchestrated [...] "Sunrise" [...] was Donna's first singing-songwriting effort for the Grateful Dead. (She and band pianist Keith Godchaux had written the songs for their duo effort Keith & Donna two years prior, on Dead spin-off label Round Records.) The song has been acknowledged as a tribute to the band's recently deceased road manager, Rex Jackson, for whom the Dead's charitable Rex Foundation was later named. Fortunately we had a chance to play Prophet and Terrapin Part Ithree times onstage and it made a huge difference ... Then <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> and <b>we</b> knew what the songs were about. Bob Weir ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} week of the season, Michigan played Notre Dame in South Bend. After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Notre Dame took a 14-0 lead in the second quarter. John Wangler replaced Rich Hewlett in the second quarter, and threw two touchdown passes in the span of 1:19 to tie the game, 14-14, at halftime. In the second half, Anthony Carter returned the opening kickoff 67 yards to the Notre Dame 32-yard line, and Michigan scored on a two-yard run by Stanley Edwards. Notre Dame scored a touchdown (but missed the extra point) with 1:03 left in the third quarter on a 49-yard interception return of a Wangler pass. The last three minutes of the game proved {{to be one of the}} most exciting finishes in the Michigan-Notre Dame rivalry. With 3:03 left in the game, Notre Dame scored to take a 26-21 lead (an attempted two-point conversion failed). On the next drive, Butch Woolfolk ran 36 yards on a trap play, taking the ball to the Notre Dame four-yard line with less than a minute to play. Wangler threw a pass to Woolfolk in the end zone that was tipped and caught by Michigan tight end, Craig Dunaway, to give the Wolverines a 27-26 lead with 41 seconds left. After a touchback, Notre Dame took over on its own 20-yard line with 40 seconds left. In five plays, Notre Dame moved the ball to the Michigan 41-yard line. Notre Dame's drive was aided by a controversial pass interference call against Michigan of which Coach Schembechler said after the game, [...] "It was the key play, without it, they wouldn't have scored at all." [...] And on the final play of the game, Notre Dame placekicker Harry Oliver kicked an improbable 51-yard field into a strong wind to give Notre Dame the 29-27 victory. Notre Dame coach Dan Devine performed the sign of the cross as Oliver's kick left his foot, and Oliver said, [...] "This is by far the greatest moment of my life. I have to thank God and Our Lady, God had to be with me." [...] Schembechler said after the game, [...] "I'm proud of the way <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> <b>We</b> had as much right to win as they did. But they hung in there and they had the last shot. Time just ran out." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{marathon}} runner, Grant {{was a familiar}} figure in the annual Boston Marathon. He completed a total of 33 marathons, and his wife ran with him in races for years.

In fact, we were running something in the neighborhood of over 3,500 miles a year for over 25 years. When I'm out running, a lot of the ideas pop into my head, and when I get a chance to sit down, I put them on paper."
