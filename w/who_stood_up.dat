The senior general Lu Xun, along with Pan Jun, {{frequently}} spoke up about Lü Yi's behaviour in front of Sun Quan, {{to the point of}} breaking down in tears. Bu Zhi, another high-ranking general, also wrote to Sun Quan on at least four occasions to speak up for Lü Yi's victims, and advise the emperor to rely on capable officials such as Gu Yong, Lu Xun and Pan Jun.|$|E
25|$|Few {{figures in}} 20th century Ireland were as {{controversial}} as Noël Browne. To his supporters {{he was a}} dynamic liberal <b>who</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to conservative and reactionary Catholicism. To his opponents he was an unstable, temperamental and difficult individual who {{was the author of}} most of his own misfortune. Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986 with the publishing of his autobiography Against the Tide. Historians like Dr. Ruth Barrington, who had written extensively about Irish health policy and had access to the files from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book's reliability.|$|E

25|$|His {{influence}} on Ukrainian {{culture has been}} so immense, that even during Soviet times, the official position was to downplay strong Ukrainian nationalism expressed in his poetry, suppressing any mention of it, and to put {{an emphasis on the}} social and anti-Tsarist aspects of his legacy, the Class struggle within the Russian Empire. Shevchenko, who himself was born a serf and suffered tremendously for his political views in opposition to the established order of the Empire, was presented in the Soviet times as an internationalist <b>who</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> in general for the plight of the poor classes exploited by the reactionary political regime rather than the vocal proponent of the Ukrainian national idea.|$|E
25|$|Hill's {{mention of}} Kim {{was an early}} {{indication}} that the new U.S. ambassador to Seoul would set a new precedent by closely approaching to South Korea's contemporary culture and society. He frequently had dialogues with South Koreans at universities, cyber chat rooms, and sometimes places that are considered hotbeds of anti-U.S. sentiments. He was the first U.S. ambassador to pay respects at Gwangju's Mangwoldong May 18 National Cemetery for thousands of civilians <b>who</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> for democracy and the hundreds who were massacred by the then-military government in May 1980. Many South Koreans suspected that the U.S. government allowed the attack, and no senior U.S. official had ever visited Mangwoldong before. According to Tami Overby, a senior official with the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea, Hill served the shortest term in her 18 years of living in Seoul but had the most impact.|$|E

[...] Baldwin-Ragaven et al. note that the medical association [...] "closed ranks in support of colleagues who colluded with the security police in the torture and death of detainees [...] also attempted to silence and discredit those doctors <b>who</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> for human rights and who demanded disciplinary action against their colleagues." ...|$|E

500|$|The Catholic bishops had {{originally}} supported the Métis but reversed {{themselves when they}} realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement.

[...] However the bishops lost their influence during the Quiet Revolution, and activists in Québec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter <b>who</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. His insanity was ignored and he was made a folk hero by the Francophones, the Catholic nationalists, the native rights movement, and the New Left student movement. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the Front de libération du Québec adopted the name [...] "Louis Riel" [...] for one of its terrorist cells.
