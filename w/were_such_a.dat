5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> high school aesthetic. It {{would have felt}} silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
5|$|Julian was now {{faced with}} a finely-balanced {{judgement}} call. The safer option was to ignore Chnodomar's challenge and to keep his forces in their fortified bases and request and await reinforcements, if necessary until the following year's campaign season. But the performance of Barbatio and the imperial comitatus in the recent campaign cast doubt on whether such reinforcements would be supplied and on their value if they <b>were.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> course would also expose Gaul to a massive Germanic invasion just when the harvest was due. Alternatively, he could fight Chnodomar alone. This offered {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory, since the Alamanni forces were now, unusually, concentrated and not divided into many disparate bands. This argument was strongly made by Florentius, the praefectus praetorio Galliarum (governor-general of Gaul), who had the crucial job of ensuring the army's recruits, pay and supplies. The Romans almost always won pitched battles with barbarians, because of their superior equipment, organisation and training. But in this case it was clearly a high-risk option because of the Germans' massive superiority in numbers.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{argue that}} the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone is actually limited to stars in certain types of systems or of certain spectral types. Binary systems, for example, have circumstellar habitable zones that differ from those of single-star planetary systems, in addition to the orbital stability concerns inherent with a three-body configuration. If the Solar System <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> binary system, the outer limits of the resulting circumstellar habitable zone could extend as far as 2.4 AU.|$|E
25|$|Artist Arnold Friberg was {{commissioned}} by Chevrolet to paint a series commemorating the 100th anniversary of American intercollegiate football in 1969. He created four paintings, each representing major turning points in the intercollegiate game. Painting No. four was titled O.J. Simpson Breaks for Daylight and captures a moment in this famous Game of The Century. These paintings were used during the 1969 Chevrolet advertising campaign and {{were among the most}} demanding and exciting pieces Mr. Friberg had done. These paintings <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success that they were taken on tour and shown at universities throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1914, Boelcke {{transferred}} {{to what was}} then known as the Fliegertruppe. His flight training took place from May to August at the Halberstädter Fliegerschule. He passed his final pilot's exam on 15 August 1914. He was then immediately posted to active duty. Due {{to the influence of}} his elder brother, Hauptmann Wilhelm Boelcke, Oswald was initially posted to Feld-Fliegerabteilung 13 (FFA 13, Aviation Section 13), of which Wilhelm was a member. Boelcke won an Iron Cross Second Class for flying 50 missions with this unit, in company with his brother. They <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> successful team they aroused antipathy in other members of the section. As a result, Wilhelm was transferred away from his brother.|$|E
25|$|This {{marked the}} first time the United States had {{successfully}} attacked the Comanches {{in the heart of the}} Comancheria, and showed that the Staked Plains were no longer a safe haven. Further, this battle emphasized if the army wished to force the wild Comanches onto reservations, the way to do it was destroy their villages and leave them unable to survive off reservation. Mackenzie's tactics <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success that Sherman empowered him to use them further during the Red River War of 1874. His attack on the village at Palo Duro Canyon, and his destruction of the Comanche horse herd at Tule Canyon, both in 1874, mirrored this battle in their entirety.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{deported}} citizens brought civil {{actions against}} Wheeler, Douglas and the others. But in State v. Wootton, Crim. No. 2685 (Cochise County, Ariz. September 13, 1919), a jury refused {{to find in}} favor of the complainants and give them relief. Defendant Wootton argued that the IWW members <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> threat to public safety that necessity demanded their removal. The jury agreed, making this one of the rare times in American law in which the necessity defense was successfully used. After this failure at law, nearly all the remaining civil suits were dropped (although a handful were settled for small sums of money).|$|E

25|$|French opera was now {{established}} as a distinct genre. Though influenced by Italian models, tragédie en musique increasingly diverged from the form then dominating Italy, opera seria. French audiences disliked the castrato singers who were extremely popular {{in the rest of}} Europe, preferring their male heroes to be sung by the haute-contre, a particularly high tenor voice. Dramatic recitative {{was at the heart of}} Lullian opera, whereas in Italy recitative had dwindled to a perfunctory form known as secco, where the voice was accompanied only by the continuo. Likewise, the choruses and dances that <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> feature of French works played little or no part in opera seria. Arguments over the respective merits of French and Italian music dominated criticism throughout the following century, until Gluck arrived in Paris and effectively fused the two traditions in a new synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Corsairs {{captured}} {{thousands of}} ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages of {{long stretches of}} coast in Spain and Italy. The raids <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> problem coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680 corsairs captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1,250,000 people were enslaved. Some corsairs were European outcasts and converts such as John Ward and Zymen Danseker. Hayreddin Barbarossa and Oruç Reis, Turkish Barbarossa Brothers, who took control of Algiers {{on behalf of the}} Ottomans in the early 16th century, were also notorious corsairs. The European pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the Barbary Coast around 1600, which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the Atlantic Ocean. The effects of the Barbary raids peaked in the early to mid-17th century.|$|E

He added [...] "Happily, it never has!", but he left a complete piano sketch, which was orchestrated in 2012–13 by Martin Yates, and recorded for the Dutton Vocalion label; it lasts for 77 minutes. The four-movement work, more conventional in structure than his completed symphonies, shows a strong Russian influence in its material.|$|E

500|$|As regimental {{structures}} developed many units selected horses {{of uniform}} type and some, {{such as the}} Royal Scots Greys, even specified colour. Trumpeters often rode distinctive horses so they stood out. Regional armies developed type preferences, such as British hunters, Hanoverians in central Europe, and steppe ponies of the Cossacks, but once in the field, the lack of supplies typical of wartime meant that horses of all types were used. [...] Since horses <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> vital component of most armies in early modern Europe, many instituted state stud farms to breed horses for the military. However, in wartime, supply rarely matched the demand, resulting in some cavalry troops fighting on foot.|$|E
500|$|According to McGee, Corbucci was [...] "the nicest man" [...] during production, and [...] "never {{tried to}} put the make on" [...] her.

[...] However, at one point while filming, Wolff had to be restrained from strangling Kinski when the latter insulted his Jewish heritage by telling him [...] "I don't want to work with a filthy Jew like you; I'm German and hate Jews." [...] Following the incident, Wolff refused to speak to Kinski unless required to by the script. Kinski later declared that he insulted Wolff because he wanted to stimulate and help him get into character.|$|E
500|$|The Fabulous Kangaroos are {{considered}} {{by many in the}} wrestling world {{as one of the best}} tag-teams in the history of wrestling. In fact, many people in the past held the mistaken belief that The Fabulous Kangaroos invented tag team wrestling, which was not true since tag team wrestling had been seen as early as 1936. The reason for this belief lies in the fact that The Kangaroos were one of the first teams to popularize tag team wrestling, and because tag teaming was often referred to as [...] "Australian rules" [...] or [...] "Australian tag team". The Kangaroos themselves were not slow to play off this belief, often claiming (kayfabe) that they <b>were</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> well coordinated tag team because [...] "Amateur team wrestling was very popular in Australia". The term [...] "Australian rules" [...] had been coined long before 1957 debut of The Kangaroos. Records indicate that tag team wrestling was already being referred to as [...] "Australian rules" [...] already in the mid-1940s. The Fabulous Kangaroos were among the first people in wrestling to play up the sports entertainment elements in professional wrestling; beyond being talented wrestlers, Costello especially was also very good at playing up their characters. The Kangaroos showed their [...] "advertising" [...] skills through promotional literature, which stated that The Fabulous Kangaroos had [...] "fashioned a razor-edged aluminum boomerang to cut the jugular of a Kodiak bear from afar". They also frequently threw cardboard boomerangs with their name and pictures on them into the crowd as they walked to the ring. The team carried a huge Australian banner with the name [...] "The Fabulous Kangaroos" [...] on it as part of their entrance rituals as well.|$|E
