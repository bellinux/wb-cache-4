25|$|Traumatic {{events are}} more subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E

Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia. The experience caused Boring to question {{what it means to be}} conscious. If a person could not recall <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> had said moments afterward, could he really be considered conscious? Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E

25|$|Cues act {{as guides}} to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is {{supposed}} to remember. A cue can be virtually anything that may act as a reminder, e.g. a smell, song, color, place etc. In contrast to free recall, the subject is prompted to remember a certain item on the list or remember the list in a certain order. Cued recall also plays into free recall because when cues are provided to a subject, they will remember items on the list {{that they did not}} originally recall without a cue. Tulving explained this phenomenon in his research. When he gave participants associative cues to items that they did not originally recall and that were thought to be lost to memory, the participants were able to recall the item.|$|E

500|$|According to Wilentz's {{analysis}} of the session's tapes, Dylan felt {{his way into the}} lyrics of one of his most popular songs, singing [...] "disconnected lines and semi-gibberish" [...] during the earlier takes. He was unsure <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> described in the song does that is just like a woman, rejecting [...] "shakes", [...] "wakes", and [...] "makes mistakes". This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored—"not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol's Factory retinue"—to be about Edie Sedgwick. The reference to Baby's penchant for [...] "fog... amphetamine and... pearls" [...] suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante, according to Heylin.|$|E

On October 24, 1981 the band suffered a serious misstep during the halftime show at Rice University when four members of a lead element turned early and, before anyone could make a correction, colliding band members ground the drill to a halt. With so many members doing exactly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> {{in front of them}} does with mere inches of clearance, the cascade effect was unrecoverable and the band simply stopped and left the field.

500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, and trying to make her own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.|$|E

500|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} whether {{the reliability of}} the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification. Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be [...] "found" [...] and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of 3 minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things.

2500|$|Generally, {{adherents of}} Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism {{believe that the}} {{individual}} Jew determines whether to follow Shabbat prohibitions or not. For example, some Jews might find activities, such as writing or cooking for leisure, to be enjoyable enhancements to Shabbat and its holiness, and therefore may encourage such practices. Many Reform Jews believe that what constitutes [...] "work" [...] is different for each person, and that only <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> considers [...] "work" [...] is forbidden. The radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated moving Sabbath to Sunday for many no longer observed it, a step taken by dozens of congregations in the United States in late 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{turned to}} how the {{community}} should convey assistance to the pauper. Rabbi Meir taught that if a person has no means but {{does not wish to}} receive support from the community's charity fund, then the community should give the person <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> requires as a loan and then convert the loan into a gift by not collecting repayment. The Sages, however, said (as Rava explained their position) that the community should offer the pauper assistance as a gift, and then if the pauper declines the gift, the community should extend funds to the pauper as a loan. The Gemara taught that if a person has the means for self-support but chooses rather to rely on the community, then the community may give the person <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> needs as a gift, and then make the person repay it. As requiring repayment would surely cause the person to decline assistance on a second occasion, Rav Papa explained that the community exacts repayment from the person's estate upon the person's death. Rabbi Simeon taught that the community need not become involved if a person who has the means for self-support chooses not to do so. Rabbi Simeon taught that if a person has no means but does not wish to receive support from the community's charity fund, then the community should ask for a pledge in exchange for a loan, so as thereby to raise the person's self-esteem. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the instruction to [...] "lend" [...] in [...] refers to the person who has no means and is unwilling to receive assistance from the community's charity fund, and to whom the community must thus offer assistance as a loan and then give it as a gift. Rabbi Judah taught that the words [...] "you [...] [...] [...] shall surely lend him" [...] in [...] refer to the person who has the means for self-support but chooses rather to rely on the community, to whom the community should give <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> needs as a gift, and then exact repayment from the person's estate upon the person's death. The Sages, however, said that the community has no obligation to help the person who has the means of self-support. According to the Sages, the use of the emphatic words [...] "you [...] [...] [...] shall surely lend him" [...] in [...] (in which the Hebrew verb for [...] "lend" [...] is doubled, וְהַעֲבֵט, תַּעֲבִיטֶנּוּ) is merely stylistic and without legal significance.|$|E
2500|$|Full nudity {{refers to}} {{complete}} nudity, while partial nudity refers {{to less than}} full nudity, with {{parts of the body}} covered in some manner. The term [...] "partial nudity" [...] is sometimes used to refer to exposure of skin beyond <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> using the expression considers to be within the limits of modesty. If the exposure is within the standards of modesty of a given culture and setting (e.g. wearing a bikini at a non-nude beach), terms such as nudity, partial or otherwise, are not normally used. If however, the degree of exposure exceeds the cultural norms of the setting, or if the activity or setting includes nudity as an understood part of its function, such as a nude beach, terminology relating to nudity and degrees thereof are typically used. Toplessness is regarded by most people as partial nudity.|$|E
2500|$|Wernicke’s is {{considered}} a more severe form of aphasia, and is more commonly seen in older populations. [...] Wernicke's area is in the left posterior temporal region of the brain, which is an important area for processing language comprehension. [...] Wernicke’s aphasia has shown a high recovery rate and frequent evolution {{to other forms of}} aphasia. Though some cases of Wernicke’s aphasia have shown greater improvements than more mild forms of aphasia, people with Wernicke’s aphasia may not reach as high a level of speech abilities as those with mild forms of aphasia. Wernicke's aphasia is also referred to as receptive or fluent aphasia, due to the ability to speak grammatically and use appropriate prosody. [...] However, much of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> with aphasia says does not make sense, and oftentimes they will produce non-existent words and be unaware what they have said. [...] People with Wernicke's aphasia have difficulties understanding the meaning of spoken words and sentences. Those with Wernicke's aphasia remain completely unaware of even their most profound language deficits.|$|E

50|$|Perspective taking is {{the ability}} to mentally put oneself in the shoes of another to imagine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other <b>person</b> might be {{thinking}} and feeling in a certain situation. Immersive virtual environments allow people to vividly share the perceptual experiences of others as if they are {{in the heat of the}} moment. In essence, our abilities to take the perspective of another person can be augmented by viscerally sharing their experiences - seeing, hearing, and feeling <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other <b>person</b> did in a particular situation. We can now literally climb into the skin of <b>the</b> other <b>person</b> to fully embody their body and senses. Current projects explore how novel affordances of interactive digital media such as immersion and interactivity can enhance the ability to understand other minds and how the virtual experience can influence our attitudes and behaviors.|$|R
2500|$|When Genie {{first moved}} in with the Riglers she still {{scratched}} and cut herself when angry, and researchers wrote that her speech was much more halting and hesitant than Butler had described. She infrequently spoke, and for reasons they could not discern she almost always a several minutes delay in her responses to speech. Typically she {{did not seem to}} listen to anyone unless she was being directly addressed and typically walked away from somebody who was speaking to her, and while she would stay with someone if specifically asked she rarely seemed attuned to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> was saying. In contrast to Butler's writings the scientists wrote that Genie only rarely used two-word sentences, and prior to [...] October 1971 they were all modifier-noun sentences, sentences indicating possession—none containing the possessive [...] 's [...] marker—or the two words of a compound noun such as [...] "number five". For the first few months linguists did not record any utterances longer than two words, and wrote that she did not use any negative sentences.|$|E
2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
