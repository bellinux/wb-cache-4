40|$|Detailed {{steady and}} {{unsteady}} numerical studies {{were performed to}} investigate tip clearance flow in an axial <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The primary objective is to understand physics of unsteady tip clearance flow, unsteady tip leakage vortex, and cavitation inception in an axial <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> Steady pressure field and resulting steady tip leakage vortex from a steady flow analysis {{do not seem to}} explain measured cavitation inception correctly. The measured flow field near the tip is unsteady and measured cavitation inception is highly transient. Flow visualization with cavitation bubbles shows that the leakage vortex is oscillating significantly and many intermittent vortex ropes are present between the suction side of the blade and the tip leakage core vortex. Although the flow field is highly transient, the overall flow structure is stable and a characteristic frequency seems to exist. To capture relevant flow physics as much as possible, a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculation and a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) were applied for the current investigation. The present study reveals that several vortices from the tip leakage vortex system cross the tip gap of the adjacent blade periodically. Sudden changes in local pressure field inside tip gap due to these vortices create vortex ropes. The instantaneous pressure filed inside the tip gap is drastically {{different from that of the}} steady flow simulation. Unsteady flow simulation which can calculate unsteady vortex motion is necessary to calculate cavitation inception accurately even at design flow condition in such a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{experiment}} {{was about to}} study of <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> with different diameters and nozzle-to-throat area ratios. Most experimental studies on <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the suction lift is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump, which implies, when the suction flow rate is maximum. However, suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate. But {{in the field of}} application there are many cases (such as drainage, dredging, well-pumping and other systems) where suction lift is more important factor than any other for <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pumps,</b> which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of suction lift of <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> Six different <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to carry out this experiment. The results revealed that the nozzle-to-throat area ratio was an important parameter to characterize the suction lift of the <b>jet</b> <b>pumps,</b> but nominal diameter had a negligible play role...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} how an artificial lift method {{in the oil industry}} works,and to compare its performance with other pump systems. Jet pumps are initially used in the oil industry for artificial lift and thus in order to do so one needs a good understanding of themechanics to predict the jet pumps’ performance. The project will begin with a review of how the jet pump operates, aiming to give the reader an insight and overview into the field of an artificial lift method. Primary literature was gathered by searching the SPE online library whereby the jet pump has received much attention in the literature. The project will first focus on the theoretical functioning of the jet pump and show how an optimum design can be achieved by changing different parameters. The second section involves case studies where the jet pump has been used as an artificial lift method. First when it is used in an inaccessible location, offshore and finally lifting heavy oils. In the case studies the design of the jet pump parameters were achieved by searching available literature and the use of in-house software. The use of in-house software and the lack of field data presented made it difficult to compare field results with theoretical performances. In all case studies the jet pump increased production. * The jet pump proved to be very reliable * Low installation and operation costs and * Can be placed in highly deviated wells The above reasons can to some extent justify the low efficiency of the jet pump. The jet pump performed with efficiencies lower than expected at the different fields. If we assume that the jet pump design is optimal and the assumptions and theoretical formulas are valid the theoretical and experimental efficiencies should be the same. To determine if this statement is correct an experimental study of the jet pump was conducted. An experimental test lop was designed and constructed to conduct the experimental study. The jet pump was constructed based on one-dimensional formulation. Water was used forboth the primary and secondary flow. The <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance was then investigated.

40|$|An ejector or <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is {{particularly}} suitable for {{pore water pressure}} relief applications in fine soils since it can operate at relatively low pumped flowrates, creating a vacuum at depth inside the well. A field trial of an ejector well dewatering system {{was carried out in}} laminated glacial lake deposits at Conwy, North Wales, in connection with the construction of the A 55 Conwy Crossing. During the trial groundwater extraction flow rates and pore water pressures were monitored. Some of the ejector wells terminated in the bedrock underlying the lake deposits: in many of these, the groundwater extraction flow rates were high and the drawdowns achieved were relatively low. Back-analysis using conventional methods modelled closely the observed response of near-by piezometers. On the other hand, wells terminating in the lake deposits yielded low groundwater extraction flow rates and vacuums at about 500 millibar developed. In this case, conventional analysis substantially overpredicted both the rate and magnitude of drawdown in the surrounding ground. The reasons for this are as yet uncertain: nonetheless, the results of the trial demonstrate clearly the influence of the hydraulic boundary conditions on the performance of a dewatering system. <br/...|$|E

Introduction: An injector is an instrument {{by means of}} which a jet of steam acting on a <b>jet</b> of <b>water</b> with which it mingles and by which it is condensed can impart to the resulting <b>jet</b> of <b>water</b> a velocity sufficient to overcome a pressure {{equal to or greater}} than the initial pressure of the steam. The ability of the injector to force water against a pressure equal to that of the working steam makes it a very valuable instrument for supplying a boiler with feed-water. The essential difference between the injector and the other forms of <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is that a great part of its energy is derived from the condensation of the steam by the <b>water.</b> The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> works on the principle that when a small volume of a fluid moving at a high velocity mingles with a larger volume it can move the whole volume at a low velocity. This principle enters into the working of the injector for a small amount of steam issuing from a boiler at a high velocity will impart to a large volume of water a considerable velocity but this {{only a small part of}} the energy developed in the injector. The greater part of the energy, as has already been stated, comes from the heat contained in the steam.

The geometrical complexity of the optical microstructures array surfaces makes them difficult to be fabricated. In this paper, a novel method named fluid jet-array parallel machining (FJAPM) is proposed to provide a new way to generate the microstructure array surfaces with high productivity. In this process, an array of abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> is <b>pumped</b> out of a nozzle, and each fluid jet simultaneously impinges the target surface to implement material removal independently. The jet-array nozzle was optimally designed firstly to diminish the effect of jet interference based on the experimental investigation on the 2 -Jet nozzles with different jet intervals. The material removal and surface generation models were built and validated through the comparison of simulation and experimental results of the generation of several kinds of microstructure array surfaces.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a new type of robotic underwater vehicle designed specifically for the inspection of critical infrastructures such as boiling water reactor nuclear power plants. These applications require vehicles that can access confined areas, maneuver precisely, and move easily in several directions. In addition, external appendages such as fins or propellers should be avoided in order to reduce the risk of damage through collisions. We propose a smooth, spheroid shaped vehicle that uses an internal propulsion system to generate and direct water-jets for propulsion and maneuvering. Drawing inspiration from aeronautics and ocean engineering, we treat this system as a control-configured vehicle (CCV) and design the system specifically for superior control performance. Like many modern CCV aircraft, our robot is designed to be open loop unstable in order to avoid bulky external stabilizers. We refer to this new type vehicle as a Control Configured Spheroidal Vehicle (CCSV). An integrated pump-valve maneuvering system is developed by combining powerful centrifugal pumps with compact Coanda-effect valves. This system is used to design and construct a compact, multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) prototype vehicle. To achieve precision orientation control, high speed valve switching is exploited using a unique Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control scheme. Dead zones and other complex nonlinear dynamics of traditional propeller thrusters and <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are avoided with use of integrated pump-valve control. Three simple control algorithms for coordinating valve switching and pump output are presented and are verified through experiments. Planar control is complicated by the presence of hydrodynamic instability. A dynamic control system that augments stability and achieves high maneuverability is outlined and implemented. A nonlinear hydrodynamic model is formulated, and its linearized dynamics are analyzed to attain insights into how physical design parameters, such as jet direction and body shape, influence controllability and stability. The integrated design method is implemented and shown to achieve high maneuverability and stability. Finally, this thesis concludes with a discussion on broader CCSV design approaches. The vehicle open loop dynamics are studied and a plant zero is shown to significantly influence closed loop performance. Jet angle and vehicle shape are explored through the lens of optimizing this plant zero location, and design recommendations are presented for both ideal and practical situations. These lessons can be used to design new CCSV systems for a variety of scales and applications. by Anirban Mazumdar. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|In this thesis, an {{experimental}} setup for {{the measurement of}} the contribution of air bubbles to gas exchange is presented. In the ocean, bubble clouds are generated especially by breaking waves and potentially contribute to the exchange of trace gases between ocean and atmosphere in a significant way. The lab experiments aim at modeling this contribution on a physical basis. In the experiment, ocean-like bubble clouds can be created with a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> in a glass tank (130 cm x 15 cm x 70 cm (H x D x W)), which was constructed for that purpose. The flow rate of air can be controlled, leading to a bubble distribution that is stationary in a statistical sense. For the measurement of the probability density of bubbles {{as a function of}} bubble radius and position in the tank, an imaging method was developed. It is based on the depth from focus principle and allows for the optical measurement of bubble radii between 100 and 1000 mum with simultaneous determination of the size-dependent measuring volume. The apparatus can be shifted automatically horizontally and vertically, allowing for capturing of the whole bubble cloud. For image evaluation, several image processing algorithms have been implemented and compared. A second optical setup for the measurement of bubbles penetrating the water surface was prepared and tested. Gas exchange rates were measured by integration of a UV absorption spectrometer in the water cycle. This allows the simultaneous measurement of the change of the concentration of multiple tracers (in the experiment: hexafluorobenzene, 1, 4 -difluorobenzene and phenylacetylene) in time.

The WSJP is operated with fuel as the primary motive fluid to pump sump water and offers a very complex flow difficult to investigate experimentally due to the opaqueness of the dense two-phase mixture. In an attempt to address this issue, a computational LES- VOF approach is used to investigate in detail the working of the WSJP. As part of this investigation, the current work aims {{to contribute to the}} understanding of liquid-liquid atomisation, lesser known than more common liquid-gas atomisation. In addition to providing a more accurate physical pic- ture, this work serves as a test of the LES- VOF methodology and its limitations. The LES- VOF calculations over a range of flow ratios presented confirm that for the stan- dard operational flow ratio, a mixture of fuel droplets into water is produced at the exit, contrary to the desired result of water drops in fuel dispersion. The occurrence of the water-in-fuel dispersion is shown to be more likely to occur at lower inlet flow rate ra- tios, through phase inversion. The turbulent break-up of the central fuel jet show clearly the important overlapping effects of small and large scale instabilities in the fragmen- tation process. Additionally, Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed using the same interface-capturing methodology in order to gain insight into the dynamics of a single fuel droplet decelerating through stagnant water, with a view towards better un- derstanding of the liquid-liquid dynamics involved in the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> computations, and especially the effect of grid resolution {{on the quality of the}} results.

Flow visualization is used to study the differences in vortex ring interaction from adjacent <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> orifices. The mutual orifice spacing is varied and the corresponding <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance is measured. The orifice spacing is shown to have less effect on the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance compared to increasing the number of orifice...|$|R
40|$|Issues {{related to}} <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> {{integrity}} {{in boiling water}} reactors (BWRs) have been of concern {{for a number of}} years. There {{have been a number of}} documents issued throughout the industry over the years related to <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> riser brace cracking, <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> riser cracking, and <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> riser elbow cracking. Based on these documents, recent field experience, and guidelines developed by the BWR Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP), <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> inspections are now being routinely conducted. As such, allowable flaw size data are of interest in order to disposition any reported indications on a real time basis. This paper describes plant-specific <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> flaw evaluation procedures that have been developed to support periodic examinations. The work presented herein is for Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. The purpose of these procedures is to develop allowable continuous throughwall flaw sizes for all of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> pressure boundary welds. These allowable flaw sizes can then be used as a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps).</b> The asymmetric shape of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> results in a time-averaged pressure drop {{that can be used}} to suppress Gedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. However, previous work has shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the time-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow separation in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are identified and coupled with the observed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother transition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting in more effective and robust <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> To make the proposed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> designs more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance is investigated. To validate the numerical results, they are compared with experimental results for one of the proposed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> designs.

40|$|A {{deep well}} <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> {{combines}} two principles of pumping; {{that of the}} centrifugal pump {{and that of the}} <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The performance of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has an impact on the deep well <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> directly, while previous studies on <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> have focused on the structure parameters, which ignored the effect of structural forms such as installation direction and the structural forms of the inlet. In this paper, three turbulence models were used to calculate a 3 D single-phase flow field in the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> and the results were compared with the experimental data to validate the simulation. Numerical simulations in different gravity fields were carried out to seek the differences of the performance between the horizontal installation and the vertical installation of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The optimum throat pipe length formulas were deduced from analysis of the simulation results. Three kinds of structural forms for suction inlet were compared by numerical simulation. The results showed that the efficiency of the vertical inlet was the highest, and some numerical results regarding flow fields and velocity distribution were shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{oscillatory flow}} through tapered {{cylindrical}} tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps)</b> {{is characterized by}} a numerical parameter study. The shape of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> results in asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects which cause a time-averaged pressure drop to occur under oscillatory flow conditions. Hence, <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are used as streaming suppressors in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. A two-dimensional axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics model is used to calculate the performance {{of a large number of}} conical <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries in terms of time-averaged pressure drop and acoustic power dissipation. The investigated geometrical parameters include the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> length, taper angle, waist diameter and waist curvature. In correspondence with previous work, four flow regimes are observed which characterize the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance and dimensionless parameters are introduced to scale the performance of the various <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries. The simulation results are compared to an existing quasi-steady theory and it is shown that this theory is only applicable in a small operation region. Based on the scaling parameters, an optimum operation region is defined and design guidelines are proposed which can be directly used for future <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> design.

40|$|The {{effect of}} flow {{separation}} and turbulence {{on the performance}} of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> in oscillatory flows is investigated. A <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> is a static device whose shape induces asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects when placed in an oscillatory flow. This will result in a time-averaged pressure drop which can be used to suppress acoustic streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. An experimental setup is used to measure the time-averaged pressure drop as well as the acoustic power dissipation across two different <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries in a pure oscillatory flow. The results are compared against published numerical results where flow separation was found to {{have a negative effect on}} the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance in a laminar flow. Using hot-wire anemometry the onset of flow separation is determined experimentally and the applicability of a critical Reynolds number for oscillatory pipe flows is confirmed for <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> applications. It is found that turbulence can lead to a reduction of flow separation and hence, to an improvement in <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance compared to laminar oscillatory flows...|$|R
