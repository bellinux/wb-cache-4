As a result, he is briefly jailed and both men are eventually fired from the travelling circus.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E
25|$|Clifford {{stated that}} <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> him {{was much more}} than just money - he said he could not stand {{hypocrisy}} in public life, reserved a particular disgust for lying politicians, and watched with growing anger what he thought happened to the NHS over the past 20 years. For this reason, and because of his working class background, Clifford was a traditional Labour supporter who worked to bring down the government of John Major because he felt that the National Health Service was being mismanaged.|$|E

25|$|Thematically, moral {{ambiguity}} is {{a prominent}} feature of Brian's work. Extreme cases of loyalty and antagonism are personified in characters such as Noelle Lange and Ivy Slade—to degrees that are sometimes questioned or denounced by the narrator. However, {{it is often}} only after the details of another character's background have been revealed that Brennan can understand <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> them, which will occasionally leave her conflicted in her judgments. The series has companion works, set {{in the past and}} the future, which are dedicated to further exploring character. These novels include the Private prequel collection, which focuses on various figures, and the spin-off series Privilege, which follows the resourceful but disturbed Ariana Osgood.|$|E

Rene Rodriguez wrote in the Los Angeles Times that this is Irving's [...] "most personal and revealing exploration of the writing process". In The Times Helen Rumbelow said Irving [...] "almost rivals Paul Auster for the mischievous way he inserts a thinly fictionalized version of himself into the tale".|$|E

500|$|James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer's work in {{creating}} more understanding into [...] "who [...] is and <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> him", something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton's film had lacked; {{at the same}} time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (Superman), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man) shared in their respective roles. According to Total Film, Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to [...] "the frisson of two people talking", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark [...] "refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining".|$|E

On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period. In another {{interview with}} Touré, D'Angelo said that he had lost his enthusiasm after Brown Sugars reception and [...] "was gettin' jaded, lookin' at what go on in the business".

500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E

2500|$|Although these {{specific}} indicia of California's intent in enacting 25524.2 {{are subject to}} varying interpretation, there are two further reasons why we should not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California's true motive. First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture. United States v. O'Brien, 391 [...] U.S. 367, 383 (1968). <b>What</b> <b>motivates</b> one legislator {{to vote for a}} statute is not necessarily <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> scores of others to enact it. Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when {{it is clear that the}} States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State so inclined to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing on economic grounds to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings. In these circumstances, it should be up to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.|$|E

The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions {{for the common good}} is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges Public sociology saying, [...] "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" [...] ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" [...] ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of <b>what</b> <b>motivates</b> altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies.
