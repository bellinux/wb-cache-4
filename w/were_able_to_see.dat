5|$|HBO aired {{the five}} seasons {{of the show}} in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008. New episodes were shown once a week, {{occasionally}} skipping one or two weeks in favor of other programming. Starting with the fourth season, subscribers to the HBO On Demand service <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each episode of the season six days earlier. American basic cable network BET also aired the show. BET adds commercial breaks, blurs some nudity, and mutes some profanity. Much of the waterfront storyline from the second season is edited out from the BET broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow {{on the rim of}} the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was no sign of the superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E
50|$|A tank {{behind a}} tall hill would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an enemy tank {{on the other}} side of the hill. Therefore, the first tank does not have a line of sight to the enemy tank. Conversely, a squad of {{soldiers}} atop the hill may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both tanks, though the tanks may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them (since the tank's upward line of sight is limited).|$|R

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers {{than it had been}} in the northern hemisphere, but southerners <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{first-hand}} what Perry did for {{a living}} before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{began at}} 2:15pm local time (06:15 UTC) around the tenth floor. The building, {{constructed}} in 1997, was {{located at the}} intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyao Road in Shanghai's Jing'an District, and was being renovated {{at the time of the}} fire. Witnesses said that the fire started with construction materials and spread throughout the building. It took over 80 fire engines and several hours to contain the fire. Shanghai residents <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> smoke from the fire several kilometres away. Firefighters were unable to hose water on the top of the -tall building from the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Being three-dimensional, we <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the world}} with our eyes in two dimensions. A four-dimensional being would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world in three dimensions. For example, it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all six sides of an opaque box simultaneously, and in fact, what is inside the box at the same time, just {{as we can see}} the {{interior}} of a square on a piece of paper. It would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all points in 3-dimensional space simultaneously, including the inner structure of solid objects and things obscured from our three-dimensional viewpoint. Our brains receive images in two dimensions and use reasoning to help us [...] "picture" [...] three-dimensional objects.|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, eye veils do not {{generally}} restrict vision {{any more than}} a dark pair of sunglasses would.

50|$|During {{the time}} that McKetta was a trooper and non-commissioned officer, he <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> first {{had some of the}} {{political}} influences on local and state police. When appointed Commissioner he <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> further into the corruption of the police force and how it attempted to affect him and his staff. One prime example was the downfall of his Deputy Commissioner, Lt. Colonel Dussia. While McKetta had high hopes and found him to be a likeable person, it was not long until he <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> “wired in” with the politicians and some questionable characters.|$|R
5|$|A few hip-hop dance shows {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the 1990s such as 1991's The Party Machine with Nia Peeples and 1992's The Grind. Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) Dance Fever, Dance 360, The Wade Robson Project, MTV Dance Crew, America's Best Dance Crew, Dance on Sunset, and Shake It Up. In 2006, MTV France documented {{the creation of a}} dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew. Viewers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste Debout, the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste Debout) all made appearances during the show.|$|E

25|$|Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979. He {{was excited}} by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the Xerox Alto and was keen to use these ideas back at Apple. By late 1979, Jobs {{successfully}} negotiated with Xerox for his Lisa team to receive two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC; when the Apple team saw the demonstration of the Alto computer they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in action {{the basic elements of}} what constituted a workable GUI. A great deal of work was put into making the graphical interface into a mainstream commercial product by the Lisa team.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} in Shanghai had {{two types of}} hippocampal {{neuronal}} cultures: In one culture, the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a glial conditioned medium (GCM), which inhibits {{the rapid growth of}} cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that astrocytes had a direct role in Long-term potentiation with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.|$|E
25|$|As {{close as}} they were, often their jobs kept them apart for long periods.

She had been an assistant mistress at Oxford High School and later became a headmistress in Brighton and his medical career had kept him in London. Even after their marriage they found it hard to spend time together as Head spent most weekends from 1903 to 1907 in Cambridge experimenting with Rivers. To cope with the long periods of separation, they started writing a joint diary and commonplace book. Each had a volume and they would exchange them from time to time so that they could comment on each other's experiences, thoughts and reading.|$|E

25|$|Viewers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the band's {{continued}} demise on {{the third}} season of Making the Band 4, which premiered on February 12, 2009. During the February 26, 2009 episode, {{as well as the}} continued season, viewers saw Richard and Fimbres eager to continue being a group together and hoping to work with Bex again. This eagerness eventually ended in the April 16, 2009 airing. Within the first five minutes of the episode, Combs told Richard and Fimbres during a meeting that he released O'Day and Woods, along with Bex, from their contracts, and would be releasing Fimbres as well. He told Richard that she will remain on the label and that if there are any future plans for a new Danity Kane, she would be the only returning member.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers who <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> downstream {{became aware of}} the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had run back to his vehicle, thinking he would be safer in his truck. After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found life jackets floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Gramsci's {{theories}} of hegemonic power, {{he argued that}} capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a counter-hegemony. By this he meant that, {{as part of the}} war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within the working-class, need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that the reason this had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling-class did not have genuine hegemonic power. So the Bolsheviks <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through a war of manoeuvre (the 1917 revolution), relatively easily, because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and the working-class building a counter-hegemony.|$|E
