Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|E

25|$|CBS, however, had {{signaled}} {{its intention}} to cancel the long-running Western series Gunsmoke, which had been airing late on Saturday nights during the 1966–1967 television season. Under pressure from CBS network president William S. Paley and his wife Babe, along with many network affiliates and longtime fans of Gunsmoke, CBS rescheduled the Western to an earlier time slot on Monday evenings at 7:30p.m. As a result, Gilligan's Island was quietly cancelled at practically the last minute, while the cast members <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> vacation. Some of the cast had bought houses based on Sherwood Schwartz's verbal confirmation that the series would be renewed for a fourth season.|$|E

He made his way back up through the field to the Top 5, but slipped back to 17th at the end.|$|E
25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> the rope, Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who was in front of him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing {{over the edge of the}} precipice.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} failed {{operations}} after that point, particularly the Battle of the Barents Sea—combined with the outstanding {{success of the}} U-boat fleet {{under the command of}} Karl Dönitz—led to his eventual demotion to the rank of Admiral Inspector of the Kriegsmarine in January 1943. The office of Admiral Inspector was only a ceremonial position with no power. After the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, Raeder, who had received confusing, misleading and incomplete reports from Admiral Oskar Kummetz, had at first reported to Hitler a great victory had been won above the Arctic Circle. Kummetz mentioned in his report that the sky was red – a reference to the Aurora Borealis – and Raeder misunderstood this as meaning that the sky was red because the British ships <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> fire. Later on the evening of 31 December 1942, Raeder called Admiral Theodor Krancke at the Wolf's Lair to explain the misunderstanding, but there was a New Year's party going on, and Krancke decided not to ruin the party by reporting the misunderstanding. Hitler during his New Year's Address delivered on the radio later that night mentioned the victory that the Kriegsmarine had won {{on the last day of}} 1942 with an entire British convoy said to had been destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Volador Jr. had {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of dressing up like various super heroes for significant matches, especially Marvel Comics super heroes such as Spider-Man, Venom and Iron Man, {{and for the}} 81st Anniversary continued the tradition coming to the ring dressed in black with a giant white skull on his chest to resemble the character The Punisher. While he wore a mask during his introductions, Volador Jr. removed it for the match as {{he was no longer}} allowed to wrestle while masked, due to a loss he suffered at the previous anniversary show. Mr. Niebla, along with his Mascota Perico came to the ring dressed in garb resembling members of the Rock band KISS, with Mr. Niebla's mask resembling the face paint that Gene Simmons wears when performing on stage. This was Thunder's first match as a rudo, showcasing a new mask that was primarily black with a few red and yellow highlights. Before the match Thunder attacked Volador Jr. again and threw him outside the ring. To sell the brutality of Thunder's attack Volador Jr. was on the floor {{for the majority of the}} first fall, leaving Máscara Dorada and Valiente to wrestle the first fall by themselves. During the first fall Thunder stayed on the apron, seemingly more focused on Volador Jr. than the other opponents. The first fall was won by Valiente and Dorada when Valiente pinned Euforia while Máscara Dorada pinned Mr. Niebla. Between the falls Volador Jr. returned to the match, ready to fight. During the second fall Thunder finally entered the ring, throwing his opponents around to showcase his greater size and strength compared to his opponents. At one point Dorada, Valiente, Eurforia and Mr. Niebla <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> the floor when Thunder grabbed Volador Jr. by the trunks and the throat and tossing him over the top rope onto the other four wrestlers. The brutality of his actions got Thunder's team disqualified, losing the match in two falls, something that did not bother Thunder as he was more interested in showing his physical dominance against the smaller opponents.|$|E
25|$|Roger Corbet had {{two older}} brothers, Thomas and John, {{as well as}} a younger brother, John, and sisters, {{including}} Joan, who was possibly the eldest of the siblings. Roger and Joan's parents, Robert and Elizabeth Corbet, had been concerned to keep the family estates together in a time of short life-spans and tortuous succession that affected many landowning families. As the eldest son, Thomas, predeceased his parents, the initial target had been to prevent the estates going to Elizabeth, his daughter, who had married Sir John Ipstones, a quarrelsome and sometimes violent man who served twice as MP for Staffordshire. In the 1360s they initiated a complex series of property transactions, using the device of fine of lands, and intended to keep the bulk of the Corbet lands effectively in tail, favouring in particular Fulk and Roger. The provisions of these fines were contested by Ipstones and Elizabeth from the outset. However, after the death of Fulk in 1382, much worse followed. Some of the provisions were revealed as mutually-contradictory. Fulk's daughter and sole heiress, also Elizabeth, contested effective ownership of property that had been assigned for life, under a fine of 1363, to Joan and her first husband, Sir Robert Harley of Willey, who died around 1370, with the remainder to Fulk and the heirs of his body. These lands at Yockleton, Shelve, Wentnor and Caus Forest, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> the western side of Shropshire, close to the Welsh border and Joan and Harley leased them for the remainder of their lives to Sir Fulk for a rent of £60 a year. However, in 1367, they levied a fine to ensure estates passed to Roger in the event of Fulk's death. As Joan was still alive when Sir Fulk died in 1382, his daughter, Elizabeth, had a reasonable expectation of continuing to lease the lands under the fine of 1363. Joan, however, intended the lands to go immediately to her younger brother, Roger, according to the fine of 1367. She had reiterated the position after Harley's death in a new fine in 1376, and this position was assumed by the inquisition post mortem following Sir Fulk's death. There was a series of legal claims and counter-claims, with the Crown intervening to try to secure an escheat while the young Elizabeth was still a minor. However, Roger emerged victorious in 1385.|$|E
