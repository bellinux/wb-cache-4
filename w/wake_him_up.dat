5|$|Within a dreamscape, hunter Bobby Singer (Beaver) {{searches}} {{around an}} old house and is suddenly attacked by a woman (Elizabeth Marleau). A maid tries to no avail to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> in his motel room. Meanwhile, Dean Winchester (Ackles) finds his brother Sam (Padalecki) drinking at a bar {{in the middle of}} the afternoon. When Dean questions him about it, a drunken Sam admits that he is upset about not being able to save Dean from his demonic pact, which left him only a year to live. What bothers Sam even more is that Dean, who has little self-worth, is not even concerned about his fate. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, during {{a night out}} with Dr. Whale (David Anders), Mary Margaret (Goodwin) tries {{to make a little}} {{conversation}} with him; however, he is busy ogling Ruby (Meghan Ory), prompting Mary Margaret to leave the cafe by herself. As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching for a place to stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E
25|$|Reyat later {{visited a}} {{television}} repair shop with a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He needed help {{so that the}} buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, {{so that it would}} turn on a light in his camper to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper, and it would even strike Justice J. Raymond Paris at Reyat's 1991 trial as an odd use for a timer.|$|E

25|$|One {{day after}} school, {{a young girl}} named Kilala Reno stumbles across a boy {{sleeping}} in her yard. After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up,</b> just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning how she would know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{was born}} as {{an only child}} to a middle-class family in Santa Monica, California. Grissom's father taught botany at a local college and passed his enthusiasm for natural {{sciences}} onto his son. His father died when Grissom was 9 years old. Grissom recalls the day his father died to Catherine Willows in the episode [...] "Still Life", [...] "He came home from school, one hot humid day, laid down on the couch. I was watching TV, my mom brought in some cold drinks, but she couldn't <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> No one would tell me why." [...] Consequently, as a young child, Grissom played doctor by performing necropsies on small, deceased animals in the local area.|$|E

Stewie tells Brian to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> after fifteen minutes of tanning but Brian falls asleep and wakes up {{six and a half}} hours later. Stewie is extremely sunburned, barely able to move and in great pain. When Stewie eventually begins to peel, Brian spots a mole on Stewie's stomach. Convinced it is skin cancer, Stewie begins to live out his dying wishes with Brian forced to help him since it was entirely his fault he caused the cancer in the first place. One of Stewie's requests was to visit the Chicago Museum of Art. As his last request he has Brian record his final thoughts. In the end, Stewie hears from Dr. Hartman that he does not have cancer and gives up tanning. Stewie then sees that Brian drew himself being hanged instead of his final thoughts, prompting the baby to quip [...] "Oh, you are just the worst type of person".|$|E

500|$|Her {{best known}} {{appearance}} on the battlefield is in the sixth century Devi Mahatmyam. The deity of {{the first chapter of}} Devi Mahatmyam is Mahakaali, who appears from the body of sleeping Vishnu as goddess Yoga Nidra to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> in order to protect Bramha and the World from two demons Madhu and Kaitabha. When Vishnu woke up he started a war against the two demons. After a long battle with Lord Vishnu when the two demons were undefeated Mahakaali took the form of Mahamaya to enchant the two asuras. When Madhu and Kaitabha were enchanted by Mahakaali, Vishnu killed them. In the later chapters the story of two demons can be found who were destroyed by Kaali. Chanda and Munda attack the goddess Durga. Durga responds with such anger that her face turns dark and Kaali appears out of her forehead. Kaali's appearance is black, gaunt with sunken eyes, and wearing a tiger skin and a garland of human heads. She immediately defeats the two demons. Later in the same battle, the demon Raktabija is undefeated because of his ability to reproduce himself from every drop of his blood that reaches the ground. Countless Raktabija clones appear on the battlefield. Kaali eventually defeats him by sucking his blood before it can reach the ground, and eating the numerous clones. Kinsley writes that Kaali represents [...] "Durga's personified wrath, her embodied fury." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E
2500|$|The {{animated}} series Legion of Super-Heroes has featured {{creatures with}} the same design as Bizarro's Krypto, though they are larger. A dog nearly identical in appearance to the standard version of Krypto appeared in the episode [...] "Message in a Bottle," [...] in the shrunken city of Kandor. He licks Superman's head to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> after he's been knocked out by Imperiex. When Brainiac 5 turns Kandor's sun from red to yellow, energizing the city's Krypton-descended inhabitants, this dog also receives superpowers.|$|E

Over the years, he has experimented with cooking, rocket science, music, electronics, decorating, telecommunication, chemistry and many other hobbies, all with uniformly catastrophic results. [...] His Peter Pan-like refusal {{to grow up and}} care about his work makes him very endearing, while ironically his antics account for half the stress experienced by his unfortunate co-workers.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{appears in}} Deadpool, again voiced by Steve Blum.

Deadpool apparently calls constantly to ask if he can take the Blackbird out for a joyride.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of Christmas morning, 25 December 2016, Michael died at his home in Goring-on-Thames, aged 53. He was found dead, lying in bed, by his partner Fadi Fawaz. No cause of death was {{immediately}} determined; although his manager Michael Lippman conjectured that heart failure was the cause of death, and that Michael [...] "passed away peacefully". Fawaz described, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, finding the performer on Christmas morning, [...] "I went round there to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> and he was just gone, lying peacefully in bed.

2500|$|The {{first day}} {{negotiations}} {{did not end}} until after midnight, and as Ford was waiting for a much-delayed meal to be served, he remembered that his alma mater, the University of Michigan, was playing the Ohio State University in football that day.

Ford then instructed his military aide Bob Barrett to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> at 6:00am the next morning with the result of the game, which he did: [...] "Twelve to ten". Ford responded: [...] "Wait a minute. Who had the twelve, and who had the ten?" [...] Barrett continued: [...] "I was afraid you'd ask me that." [...] It was clear to Ford that Ohio State had won, even before Barrett filled him in on the details of the game, including Michigan's last-second missed field goal.|$|E

He had been suffering from dyspepsia, aggravated by bronchial trouble, in previous years. McDonnell returned to the city on August 13, 1888, reportedly [...] "looking well and hearty", but intended to arrange to extend his leave of absence and return to Derby the following evening. He was on duty at the stationhouse that day and, leaving orders for a morning wake up call at 9 am, went to bed in the sergeants' room on the second floor at around 10:00 pm. He was seen [...] "sleeping peacefully" [...] by a Sergeant Reilly at 6 am, however he was found dead three hours later when a doorman came to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> A doctor was summoned, but physicians found that he had been dead for several hours.

2500|$|Cielo, 20, {{was found}} {{unconscious}} on December 7, 2008 by his mother. The night before, {{he was last}} seen playing an online video game up until 10 PM in an internet cafe in Quezon City. Marky {{is said to have}} made several unanswered calls to his manager-mentor. When he arrived home, he had a discussion with his mother about [...] "something personal". His mother advised Marky to sort out his problem saying that only he can solve his problems. The next morning, his mother entered his room in their house in Antipolo at around 6 AM to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> for a charity event. When he did not respond, she immediately rushed him to the nearby Antipolo Doctors Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. At present, the cause of Cielo’s death remains unknown. [...] This led to speculations of suicide precipitated by threats which allegedly came from the son of Governor Luis [...] "Chavit" [...] Singson, Ronald due to him being too close to Lovi Poe. These facts were never discussed or even became and angle for the police to dig more into the case because of their fear of getting caught up with the influence of Governor Singson.|$|E

2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up</b> {{to make sure he was}} still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I hear some of it because a lot of the lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to <b>wake</b> <b>him</b> <b>up.</b> As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
