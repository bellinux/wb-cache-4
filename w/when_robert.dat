5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> Hichens was {{appointed}} senior officer {{in command of}} the 6th MGB Flotilla from September 1941, he became the first RNVR officer to command a flotilla in the Second World War. Along with the new command came a promotion to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot <b>when</b> <b>Robert,</b> Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{studied at}} the Marischal College in Aberdeen from 1711–1715. He then studied law at Edinburgh University before {{completing}} his education at Groningen and Utrecht. He {{became a member of}} the Faculty of Advocates on his return to Edinburgh in early 1722. He was appointed as Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Advocates in January 1759 and became Dean <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Dundas was elevated to Lord President of the Court of Session in June 1760.|$|E
60|$|The sun sank red and a ruddy {{twilight}} fell. It soon passed. Darkness {{had about}} set in <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> {{came over to}} Joan, carrying bread, coffee, and venison.|$|R
25|$|Mutombo was {{to marry}} Michelle Roberts, a medical student, in 1994. However, {{the wedding was}} {{canceled}} <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> refused to sign a prenuptial agreement {{the day before the}} wedding.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>Roberts</b> arrived, it was patent {{that he was}} mildly drunk. He was a tall, lean, slack-jointed individual, and his walk, {{like his}} talk, was a smooth and languid drawl.|$|R
5|$|In 1705 he {{was elected}} a member of Parliament (MP) for Northallerton in a by-election. He {{remained}} an MP until 1713, usually voting with the Whigs and working on committees concerned with regulating servant wages and the naturalisation of foreigners. After leaving Parliament, he was appointed to a commission dealing with stamp duties, then later was a commissioner of excise. He remained in that position until 1735, <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Walpole had him removed to free the post for one of Walpole's friends.|$|E
5|$|Robert and Tracy {{are given}} more stories {{than in the}} first series. Their main story arc begins in the third episode <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> is caught {{by all of the}} main {{characters}} and his parents in a maid's outfit being spanked by a prostitute. The couple temporarily separate while Robert experiments with cross-dressing, but they are reunited {{by the end of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|Robert's father, William Tatton, {{drowned in}} the River Mersey <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> was 10 years old. As the only male heir Robert {{inherited}} his father's estate in Wythenshawe, but as a minor he was made a ward of the king, Charles I, until he came of age. On 9January 1628, Robert married Anne Brereton, the third daughter of William Brereton of Ashley. The couple went on to have four sons and two daughters.|$|E
5000|$|At the Final Seven, {{it seemed}} that Diaz-Twine and Hastie were doomed by this newly created alliance, but Diaz-Twine swayed Bradley and Johnson by spying on Roberts and Dalton to expose their {{intentions}} to eliminate the Morgan girls after getting rid of Diaz-Twine and Hastie. However, <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> and Dalton learned of this impending mutiny, they regained the trust of Diaz-Twine and Hastie (with the help of Dalton's infamous [...] "dead grandmother" [...] lie) to successfully blindside Tijuana. Soon after that, they were betrayed once again <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> and Dalton switched sides and Hastie was voted out next.|$|R
50|$|A {{short time}} later, WRJH was {{sold at a}} {{bankruptcy}} auction. That was <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> Broadcasting bought WRJH for $1,950,000.00, eventually moved its studios into TV station WRBJ's and changed the callsign to WRBJ.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, the barony is now {{considered}} to have been created <b>when</b> <b>Robert's</b> eldest son, William de Ros was summoned to Parliament from 6 February 1299 to 16 October 1315 by writs directed Willelmo de Ros de Hamelak.|$|R
5|$|At Geneviève's apartment, Robert says he {{must end}} their {{relationship}} but invites {{her to join}} them for a weekend retreat to Robert and Christine's country estate, La Colinière, in Sologne. Later, Octave induces Robert to invite André to the estate as well. They joke that André and Geneviève will begin a relationship, thereby solving everyone's problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds and trying to eliminate rabbits. Marceau (Julien Carette)a poachersneaks onto the estate to retrieve a rabbit caught in a snare. Before Marceau can escape, Schumacher catches him and begins to escort him from the property <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> demands {{to know what is}} happening. Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits and Robert offers him a job as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Lisette.|$|E
5|$|Between 1793 and 1800 the Grand Junction Canal was built, {{connecting}} London to the Midlands. The canal {{followed the}} course of the River Bulbourne through the Chilterns, and included a branch to Aylesbury. For the first time the coal and industrial products of northern England and London could be cheaply supplied to Buckinghamshire, and grain and timber from Buckinghamshire's farms could easily be shipped to market. The route taken by the Grand Junction Canal ran through the east of the county, leaving the Chiltern towns of southern Buckinghamshire isolated. <b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> Stephenson's London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 it paralleled the route of the canal through Buckinghamshire. Although the short 1839 Aylesbury Railway linked Aylesbury to the London and Birmingham Railway, the rest of central Buckinghamshire remained unconnected to the railway and canal networks.|$|E
5|$|Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, {{with whom}} he had seven {{children}} at Plas Mawr. <b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that would have put it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire. Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Roberts</b> began modeling, {{she began}} to work for {{magazines}} such as Elle, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Glamour, Marie Claire and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue of 2000, Victoria's Secret Country 1998, 1999 and Victoria's Secret lookbook 2000, 2001.|$|R
50|$|He died, aged 92, on 20 May 2013. A {{memorial}} service {{was held for}} him at the Lincoln's Inn Chapel on 12 November 2013. David Wilson, the Governor of Hong Kong <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> was Chief Justice, delivered an address.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, {{the call}} letters WRBJ were {{assigned}} briefly to WDBT radio (now WFOR) in Hattiesburg, Mississippi's first radio station. Only since September 2006 <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> Broadcasting bought out Urban radio station WRJH did those call letters {{return to the}} market.|$|R
5|$|First-class cricket {{was first}} played in South Africa in the {{previous}} 1888–89 season, <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Warton managed a side which toured the country, playing against representative teams {{from each of the}} provinces, and two matches against South Africa, which were later adjudged to have Test cricket status. During that tour, Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side; which was judged to be Kimberley. In other first-class matches during the 1889–90 season, Kimberley faced Natal twice, winning both matches. Transvaal did not play any first-class cricket prior to their Currie Cup contest with Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{was born}} in Watertown, Jefferson County, New York, on November 22, 1814 to Robert Collins Hastings and Patience Brayton. Robert Collins Hastings {{was a good friend}} and {{supporter}} of DeWitt Clinton, whom Serranus gets his middle name from. <b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> died in 1824, the family moved to St. Lawrence County, New York. He completed a six-year course at Gouverneur Academy, and in 1834, he became taught and became the principal at Norwich Academy, located in Chenango County, New York. He introduced the Hamiltonian system of instruction and the Angletean system of mathematics to the academy. In 1835, he resigned from his position at the academy to study law.|$|E
5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. <b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Pam's Replacement", Andy, Darryl and Kevin {{have another}} jam {{session in the}} {{warehouse}} where Robert joins them. But they're eventually phased out <b>when</b> <b>Robert's</b> more talented bandmates step in. The three end up having their own jam session outside.|$|R
50|$|Arizona News Service, {{which publishes}} the Arizona Capitol Times, {{was founded by}} Ned Creighton in 1906 before Arizona became a state. The {{operation}} was run and expanded by his son <b>Robert</b> until 1970, <b>when</b> <b>Robert's</b> son, also Ned, assumed control of the business.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Roberts</b> was CEO of Infinium, {{the company}} {{failed to report}} a {{substantial}} amount of interest and penalties on unpaid payroll taxes. From its inception, the company had consistently reported a small amount of cash on hand amid extensive (and increasing) debt.|$|R
5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in one session (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E
5|$|Initially Los Alamos was {{supposed}} to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Bacher and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Monteverdi revived in {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries among music {{scholars}} in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following {{the discovery of the}} L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Roberts</b> was in Europe he {{left his}} manuscripts and papers, {{including}} work not yet published, with a Dr. Wainwright in Saint John, who stored them in his basement. They were destroyed {{in the spring of}} 1919 when the Saint John River flooded.|$|R
50|$|William (Billy) Weston (1847-1935) was an Australasian billiards {{champion}} {{and was an}} early teacher of former world champion,Walter Lindrum. Billy, as he was usually known, toured Australia and New Zealand as playing partner to John Roberts Jr. (billiards player) <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> visited Australia.|$|R
50|$|Roberts interviewed Milton Friedman on EconTalk just a {{few months}} before Friedman's death in November, 2006. <b>When</b> <b>Roberts</b> was asked in 2015 to pick his most {{interesting}} episode, he mentioned two podcasts and included the Friedman interview he had conducted almost a decade earlier.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it had taken on a distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> II inherited the throne.|$|E
5|$|Narissa {{attempts}} to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realizing Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss {{is the only}} force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. After Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, he prompts Robert to do so instead. <b>When</b> <b>Robert</b> kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue dragon and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa {{to the top of}} the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.|$|E
5|$|On the Auburn {{possession}} that ensued, the Alabama defense collected {{their first}} turnover {{of the game}} <b>when</b> <b>Robert</b> Lester intercepted a Jonathan Wallace pass at the Tigers' 29-yard line. Five plays later the Crimson Tide led 28–0 after McCarron threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood. The Alabama defense held Auburn to their second three-and-out of the game, and then the Crimson Tide scored their fifth touchdown of the game on a one-yard Lacy run for a 35–0 lead. Auburn then committed their second turnover of the game when Nico Johnson forced a Tre Mason fumble that Dee Milliner recovered {{and returned to the}} Tigers' 35-yard line. Alabama then took a 42–0 halftime lead when McCarron threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Cooper.|$|E
25|$|Frisell's {{first group}} to receive much acclaim was a quartet with Kermit Driscoll on bass, Joey Baron on drums, and Hank Roberts on cello (later slimmed {{down to a}} trio <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> left). Many other albums with larger {{ensembles}} were recorded with this group as the core.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} memorable {{highlights}} of his career occurred on May 13, 1954, <b>when</b> <b>Roberts</b> gave up a lead-off home run to Cincinnati Reds (then known as the [...] "Redlegs") player Bobby Adams and then retired 27 consecutive batters to win 8-1, on a one-hit game.|$|R
