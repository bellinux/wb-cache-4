5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> another moving {{object in the}} vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Andriamasinavalona is {{credited}} with founding Ambohimanga, a site of spiritual and historical significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. Oral history recounts that Andriamasinavalona first remarked a distant hill named Ambohitrakanga <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> a bonfire lit on its southern face 24 kilometers away from his rova at Antananarivo; the visibility of the site from his capital led Andriamasinavalona to desire the hill as a residence for his son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriamasinavalona gave the hill its current name, and when he divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants in 1710, he gave the eastern quadrant of Avaradrano to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, who transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, the British {{began to}} land on the shore, Clinton's advance guard of 4,000 British light {{infantry}} and Hessian jägers landing first. Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of John Glover. Glover was atop a hill with a telescope <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> the British ships. (hill {{on the west side of}} the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Hutchinson River on East Sanford Blvd. in Mount Vernon, NY on the opposite side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and Pelham Memorial High School) Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to Charles Lee, Washington's second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders, and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack. Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the 14th, 13th, 3rd and the 26th Continental Regiments. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve. Glover had not closed half the distance when he ran into approximately 30 skirmishers. Glover ordered a Captain and his 40-man company forward as an advance guard to hold the British in check, while Glover organized the rest of the force.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating {{dinner in the}} detached dining room <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately. However, the fire quickly spread due to high winds. Despite the efforts of Wright and his neighbors to extinguish the flame, the living quarters of the second Taliesin were quickly destroyed. However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E
5|$|During England’s second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. {{fell for}} 43, lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side to end a {{partnership}} of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> the crowd reaction; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay {{isolated}} helium on Earth {{by treating}} the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite {{with at least}} 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun., One of the Lines in the Coronal Spectrum. Preliminary Note|author = Ramsay, William|author-link = William Ramsay|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume = 58|issue = 347–352|pages = 65–67|date = 1895|url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044106280316;view=1up;seq=79|doi = 10.1098/rspl.1895.0006}} These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It was independently isolated from cleveite {{in the same year}} by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight. Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>noticed</b> unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.|$|E
