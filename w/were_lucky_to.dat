25|$|The Patriots were a Cinderella team {{during the}} 1985 season because many sports writers and fans thought they <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> {{make the playoffs}} at all. New England began the season losing three of their first five games, but won six {{consecutive}} games to finish with an 11–5 record. However, the 11–5 mark only earned them third place in the AFC East behind the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets.|$|E

25|$|After 50 years Santos {{began to}} be seen as {{the best team in the}} world. When Pelé made his debut in the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team was already twice state {{champion}} (1955/56). The King had as fellow players Zito, Pagão, Formiga, Hélvio, Jair da Rosa Pinto, Urubatão, Tite and Pepe. Therefore, it is true that Santos <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> have Pelé. He was also fortunately only just beginning his career at Santos.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had just}} lost to New Zealand 2-1 at home during the 1985-86 season and <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> draw 0-0 against India. The team was greatly {{weakened}} by defections to the South African rebel tours. However they had just finished the home summer on a high note, having defeated India and New Zealand in the 1985-86 triangular one-day series. Allan Border was confident the team would win the one day series and bring back the Trans-Tasman Trophy.|$|E
25|$|England <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> win the toss and get {{a chance}} to bowl under cloudy skies at Headingley, as they beat Australia by nine wickets to take their second victory in five ODIs so far. Putting Australia in to bat, they didn't get {{immediate}} reward – as especially Darren Gough was smashed about by Adam Gilchrist, but the run rate at least stayed around four an over. And with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff removing the openers in successive overs, things looked brighter for the English. Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn added 39 for the next wicket, but in 11 overs, all while the English captain Michael Vaughan set attacking fields according to the new power play rules.|$|E

25|$|At Vimeiro, Junot {{sent the}} 3rd Dragoons {{with one of}} his {{flanking}} brigades, leaving Margaron with three cavalry regiments. After his first three frontal attacks failed, Junot sent Kellermann with his grenadier reserve to strike at Vimeiro village. After a hand-to-hand struggle, the grenadiers were beaten and Margaron sent one regiment to cover their retreat. At this moment, 240 troopers of the British 20th Light Dragoons charged, broke through the French cavalry and began cutting down the grenadiers. Excited by their success, the British horsemen got out of control and pressed their charge too far. When Margaron unleashed his last two regiments, the light dragoons <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> get away with only 21 killed, including Colonel Taylor, 24 wounded and 11 captured.|$|E
25|$|Of the 10 {{first-class}} matches, 6 were won, 3 {{lost and}} 1 drawn. Overall 11 matches were won, 3 lost and 6 drawn.

The tourists <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> draw the first match against Jamaica but the next week won heavily by an innings and 169 runs. The tourists lost the second match against Barbados and then twice to Trinidad. Both match against the combined XI were won. A number of the minor matches were drawn but the tourists did win by an innings in all their matches in St. Lucia with the home team never scoring more than 102 in any innings. St. Vincent took the first innings lead in both their games but both matches were drawn.|$|E
25|$|The club's European {{campaign}} {{concluded with}} a 4–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur; a result that meant that Rovers failed to pick up any points during the group stage. In what was only their second competitive fixture {{since the end of}} the domestic season, Rovers had the better of the opening minutes and should have taken the lead after only 2 minutes, but James Paterson's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Steven Pienaar's first goal for Tottenham was the first goal of the match. Andros Townsend and Jermain Defoe scored Tottenham's second and third goals respectively. Although Tottenham did score a fourth goal through Harry Kane, it was Rovers who had the best of the second half, while both Jake Livermore and Carlo Cudicini <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> avoid red cards after bringing down Rovers players when they were through on goal. This was Michael O'Neill's final match in charge of the club.|$|E

25|$|England {{got off to}} a {{good start}} in the ODI series, winning the first match by 114 runs. Kevin Pietersen hit an unbeaten 110 while Paul Collingwood took figures of 4-15. England <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> avoid defeat in the second match. After being bowled out for 162, New Zealand reached 127/2 of 19 overs. However, they did not win as 20 overs were needed to {{constitute}} the game. Although England bowled New Zealand out for 182 in the third ODI, they could only manage 160, meaning New Zealand won by 22 runs and levelled the series 1-1. The fourth match was another close encounter, with New Zealand winning by just one wicket after hitting the winning runs off the final ball of the match. New Zealand won the final match by 51 runs, securing a 3-1 series win for them, the same scoreline when the two sides had met in New Zealand earlier in the year.|$|E
500|$|By October 1977, Chaplin's health had {{declined}} {{to the point that}} he needed constant care. In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes. Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery. Among the film industry's tributes, director René Clair wrote, [...] "He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us."

500|$|For {{more than}} fifty years before the Severn Railway Bridge was opened, there had been {{discussion}} and various proposals for rail routes to cross the Severn, either by a bridge or a tunnel, but most of these did not leave the drawing board. The exception was a tunnel near Newnham-on-Severn in 1810; this had been excavated part-way under the river when water broke in, and the tunnellers <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> escape with their lives. The damage was irreparable and the project abandoned. In 1845, an ambitious project by Isambard Kingdom Brunel was to bridge the Severn near Awre for his projected South Wales Railway, bypassing Gloucester completely. This plan got as far as receiving the approval of Parliament but did not proceed. Other schemes were mooted and in 1871, six different schemes were under consideration. Finally the Severn Bridge Railway's scheme was approved by Parliament and received Royal Assent on 18 July 1872.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong was {{selected}} {{as part of the}} Australian cricket team to tour England in 1902. [...] He started the tour well, taking eight for 47 in the second innings against Nottinghamshire, his best bowling figures to that date. [...] The first Test, at Edgbaston was rain-affected and the Australians <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> come away with a draw, being dismissed for 36 in their first innings. The rest of the close-fought series was followed with interest by the English public. [...] The second Test at Lord's was rained off, and Australia won the third at Bramall Lane by 143 runs. [...] The final two Tests were nail-biters—Australia winning the fourth at Old Trafford by only three runs and England earning a consolation victory in the fifth Test at the Oval by one wicket, when last-wicket pair George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes eked out the final runs. [...] Armstrong had a good tour, making 1,075runs at 27.56 and taking 72 wickets at an average of 17.90, but the star for the Australians was Victor Trumper, who made 2,570 runs at an average of 48.49 including eleven centuries.|$|E
500|$|Rutigliano was a gambler: he {{tinkered with}} offenses, took chances on trick plays {{and was not}} afraid to break with the play-calling {{conventions}} of his time. The coach, who earned the nickname [...] "Riverboat Sam" [...] for his risk-taking approach, once said that security was [...] "for cowards". [...] "I believe in gambling", he said. [...] "No successful man ever got anywhere without gambling." [...] This seat-of-your-pants philosophy began to manifest itself on the field in 1979. The campaign started with a nail-biter against the New York Jets that the Browns won in overtime on a Cockroft field goal as time expired. [...] "If we continue to play 'em that way all year, I'll be gone before the 10th game because my heart just won't take it", Rutigliano said after the game. In the second week, Cleveland beat the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 on a Sipe touchdown to Rucker with 52 seconds left. The third game was an equally improbable 13–10 win against the Baltimore Colts. Cleveland Plain Dealer sports editor Hal Lebovitz wrote after the game that these [...] "Kardiac Kids" [...] <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> have pulled off the win after Colts kicker Toni Linhart missed three field goals.|$|E
500|$|The Cardiff City {{victory in}} the 1927 FA Cup Final remains {{the only time that}} the trophy has been won by a team outside England. At the time it had been {{referred}} to as the [...] "English Cup". This was a highlight of the coverage in the press afterwards, as was the volume of singing that took place during the proceedings. The article in the Hull Daily Mail even went as far as to suggest that the match would be remembered for the singing specifically, calling it the [...] "Singing Final". There was an open air radio broadcast of the match in Cathays Park attended by 15,000 fans, and after the victory the team's colours were strung throughout the city, and local shopkeepers made replicas of the trophy out of butter to display in shop windows. After the match, the Cardiff team headed to a hotel in Bloomsbury before heading to Windsor and Eton College on the following day. They toured the College, and some of the players visited Windsor Castle. They headed back to Cardiff later that day from Paddington station, where they arrived at 6:35pm. They were met by motor coaches and a band, and driven to the City Hall. Some 150,000 fans lined the streets of Cardiff to welcome the team back home. After leading some communal singing outside the City Hall, the team and their wives later attended a dinner and dance in the building. While some press reports claimed that Keenor had said that the team <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> have won, he refuted the claim, saying that the superiority of Cardiff's defence that led them to victory.|$|E
