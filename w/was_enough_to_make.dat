5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E

5|$|By 1440 he {{was firmly}} in the king's favour, being made in {{succession}} the first ever English viscount as Viscount Beaumont (1440), possibly because by then Boulogne was effectively lost to him and then granted royal lands in East Anglia, further official positions in royal castles, Lord Great Chamberlain, elected to the Garter and the feudal Viscountcy of Beaumont in France. In 1445 he was made premier viscount, and granted precedence over any other- as-yet unmade- viscounts. These consistent promotions and favouritism {{have been the subject}} of some speculation by historians; John Watts has questioned why he 'attracted such an extraordinary heap of honours and perquisites from the crown in these years.' He suggests that as a major noble in East Anglia- with all the territorial and regional significance that meant- <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him worthy of promotion. Beaumont commissioned a contemporary manuscript on chivalry, Knyghthode and Bataile, an adaption of Vegetius for presentation to the king, and was also a major benefactor of Queens' College, Cambridge which the king had granted by charter to his wife Margaret in 1448.|$|E

In June she was renamed Vindictive, the fifth ship of that name in the RN, to perpetuate {{the name of the}} old protected cruiser , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May. She commissioned on 1 October and, after briefly working up, joined the Grand Fleet's Flying Squadron on 18 October only {{a few weeks before the}} Armistice on 11 November. For the rest of the year she conducted flying trials and exercises, including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft, of which two were lost in accidents. The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet's last operational Sopwith Pup. Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels, had demonstrated that the turbulence from these <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> successful landings almost impossible at high speed. Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving.|$|E

25|$|On many lines, the new {{units were}} warmly welcomed. It is {{important}} to remember that while the first generation DMUs had given many years of service, in very many cases, they suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, the mere fact that the trains were clean and new <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them welcome countrywide.|$|E

The king of Cappadocia died too, whereupon Germanicus sent Quintus Veranius to organize Cappadocia as a province – a profitable endeavor as Tiberius was able to reduce the sales tax down to [...]5% from 1%. The revenue from the new province <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the difference lost from lowering the sales tax. The Kingdom of Commagene was split on whether or not to remain free or to become a province with both sides sending deputations, so Germanicus sent Quintus Servaeus to organize the province.|$|E
500|$|As {{a congressman}} for three months, Greeley {{introduced}} legislation for a homestead act {{that would allow}} settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported {{a bill that would}} have corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had [...] "divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it." ...|$|E

At one point, the umpire denied an appeal by Norman Yardley for lbw against Hassett, {{prompting}} a frustrated Neville Cardus to write, [...] "... he deserved to be {{the sight of a}} cricketer of his gifts continuing to deny his eye and technique in a Test match <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any umpire go mad and, like the judge in Chesterton's story, administer justice instead of law." [...] Hassett ended the Tests with 47 in the second innings as Australia stumbled to a five-wicket win on a deteriorating and spinning pitch in the Fifth Test in Sydney, in pursuit of 214. He finished the series with 332 runs at 47.43 and had difficulty against the leg spinner Doug Wright, who dismissed him five times in seven innings. He had added 126 for Victoria against Wally Hammond’s Englishmen just a week earlier.|$|E

Fay Maschler visited the new establishment in April 2010 for the Evening Standard, who disagreed with the idea that it was a reopening and said that it instead should be considered to be a new Ramsay restaurant. She was impressed by the majority of the food, especially the desserts, however felt that the service was a little alien. [...] Marina O'Loughlin for the Metro in June 2010, thought that the food was fine and although the restaurant seems to have been entirely designed with gathering Michelin stars, it seemed that everything on the menu had been done somewhere else but better.

500|$|In 1905, Georgii Pobedonosets briefly {{joined the}} Potemkin mutiny.

The next day the fleet {{approached}} Potemkin, then suddenly retreated. She then followed them, deliberately goading the officers to order the sailors to fire on their comrades. The crew of Georgii Pobedonosets refused: [...] "We won't fire! We won't man the guns! We refuse to engage the Potemkin." [...] Her sailors cheered the rebel sailors' bravery. Dorofey Koshuba, {{a member of the}} revolutionary sailors' organisation Tsentralka, broke into the armoury, ordered Captain Ilya Guzevich to halt the ship, pushing him away when he refused. The ship halted, Guzevich pleaded with the sailors to go to Sevastopol, even offering to let the 70 revolutionaries onto Potemkin. Afanasi Matushenko, the leader of Potemkins crew, arrived with several revolutionaries who made a speech that inspired the sailors to arrest the officers. This <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his second-in-command, Lieutenant Grigorkov, blow his own brains out. Apart from this, the seizure was bloodless. The sailors elected a committee (Koshuba and nine others), locked the officers in the stateroom and ripped off their epaulettes. The officers were put ashore in Odessa. It was decided that the petty officers should be put ashore too the next day. Senior Boatswain A. O. Kuzmenko became captain.|$|E
