5|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis {{said that}} the church <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> founded in about 605 by St Eugrad.

St Gallgo's and St Eugrad's have been in the same parish since at least 1253.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the myth can be found first in Rommel's drive for success as a young officer in World War I, and then in his popular 1937 book Infanterie Greift An (Infantry Attacks) that was written in a style that diverged from the German {{military}} literature of the time. The book became a bestseller, and <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> read by Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|A later popular Polish legend {{related to}} the history of the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is the tale of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs.

Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> canceled.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht's wife's name is unknown. A {{fifteenth century}} chronicle now held by Oxford University names Ecgberht's wife as Redburga who <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> a {{relation}} of Charlemagne that he married {{when he was}} banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date. He is reputed {{to have had a}} half-sister Alburga, later to be recognised as a saint for her founding of Wilton Abbey. She was married to Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and on his death in 802 she became a nun, Abbess of Wilton Abbey. He was believed at one time to also be the father of Saint Eadgyth of Polesworth and Æthelstan of Kent.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} loyalty of Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa.

Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E

5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be the {{daughter}} of an unspecified noblewoman, she <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> young, wealthy and living in fashionable Manchester Square. In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes <b>was</b> <b>supposedly</b> murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's {{departure}} is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
