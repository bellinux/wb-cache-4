500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (and I use the word advisedly) clever. It is also impressive, not merely {{as an act of}} impersonation but perhaps above all for the fiendish diligence with which it is carried out...presuppose(s) formidable research {{on the part of the}} author, who is American, educated in France and writing fluent, idiomatic and purposeful French. This tour de force, which not everyone <b>will</b> <b>welcome,</b> outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so for some time to come. No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks what it is that turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E
500|$|Finlay {{had been}} {{appointed}} on the conditions {{that he would not}} claim a pension (it was war-time, and there were already four retired Lord Chancellors claiming £5000 per year pensions) and that he would resign when required. Despite this he was surprised when he was dismissed after the 1919 general election, first hearing about it when it was mentioned in the newspapers. His replacement Lord Birkenhead was appointed on 14 January 1919, and was a controversial choice; he was only 46 when appointed and was unpopular with large sections of the Bar as a result; George V himself wrote to the Prime Minister before Birkenhead was appointed and said that [...] "His Majesty does not feel sure that [...] has established such a reputation in men's minds as to ensure that the country <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> him to the second highest position which can be occupied by a subject of the Crown". Birkenhead and Schuster established a strong partnership, and Schuster played a part in instituting Birkenhead's legal reforms, particularly those relating to the law of real property.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Onn Ja'afar {{proposed}} to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, {{which would have}} diluted its identity {{as a champion of}} ketuanan Melayu. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as [...] "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays." [...] Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: [...] "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races." ...|$|E

500|$|In another {{unqualified}} review, Time {{wrote that}} the film had [...] "a vitality that makes their efforts fully the equal of the original picture... Screenwriters Hurlbut & Balderston and Director James Whale have given it the macabre intensity proper to all good horror pieces, but have substituted a queer kind of mechanistic pathos for the sheer evil that was Frankenstein." [...] The Oakland Tribune concurred it was [...] "a fantasy produced on a rather magnificent scale, with excellent stagecraft and fine photographic effects". While the Winnipeg Free Press thought that the electrical equipment {{might have been better}} suited to Buck Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as [...] "exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome", declaring that [...] "All who enjoyed Frankenstein <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> his Bride as a worthy successor." [...] The New York Times called Karloff [...] "so splendid in the role that all one can say is 'he is the Monster. The Times praised the entire principal cast and Whale's direction in concluding that Bride is [...] "a first-rate horror film", and presciently suggested that [...] "The Monster should become an institution, like Charlie Chan." [...] Bride was nominated for one Academy Award, for Best Sound Recording (Gilbert Kurland).|$|E
500|$|... "Fakin' It" [...] opens side two {{and finds}} the protagonist mulling over his insecurities and shortcomings. It has been {{suggested}} that [...] "Fakin' It" [...] may be an allegory for Simon's relationship with Art Garfunkel. [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] employs breakfast-food images to lampoon Hollywood and the film industry. It improbably takes an [...] "abrupt left turn" [...] in its third verse, when the singer begins to fantasize himself an admired soldier. [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] collects wide-ranging images to address social milieu, with a constant reassurance that Jesus loves the eponymous character, God will bless her, and heaven <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> her. The song includes a famous reference to athlete Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees, one of Simon's favorite baseball teams. It also features an explicit homage to the Beatles, with Simon uttering the meaningless phrase [...] "coo-coo-ca-choo" [...] that John Lennon sings in [...] "I Am the Walrus". [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] is an older track that dates back to Simon's days in England in 1965. The song follows a hopeless poet, with [...] "manuscripts of unpublished rhyme", unsure of his achievements in life. In sharp contrast, the whimsical, Orwellian [...] "At the Zoo" [...] both concludes the album and what Simon described as the [...] "cycle of life". The song indicates that the personalities of certain zoo animals may represent particular walks of people. The song was originally intended as a possible children's book. According to rock journalist Bud Scoppa, [...] "the record is a meditation on the passage of life and the psychological impact of life's irreversible, ever-accumulating losses". The song cycle also describes {{the life and death of}} the romantic ideal of the American Dream.|$|E

This is where most players will find the fault with 2K16, as not every mode external to game time is as fleshed out or competent as the main course.

2500|$|The Reid Commission {{reported}} that Tunku Abdul Rahman and the Malay Rulers had asked that [...] "in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there {{must not be}} discrimination on grounds of race and creed." [...] At that time, Tunku Abdul Rahman {{was the leader of}} the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which led the Alliance coalition. Eventually the Alliance would become the Barisan Nasional and Tunku Abdul Rahman later became the first Prime Minister of Malaysia. When succeeding to the UMNO Presidency, Tunku had expressed doubts about the loyalty of the non-Malays to Malaya, and as a result, insisted that this be settled before they be granted citizenship. However, he also stated that [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> them as Malayans.

2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{promotion}} of women's rights in the secular sphere, women in Utah, like renowned poet Eliza R. Snow, spoke of women's equality in sacred matters.

The idea of a Heavenly Mother expanded to a loving mother who sent each of us off on our journey to this earth and who <b>will</b> <b>welcome</b> us back to her again after death. As written in poems by Mormon authors, [...] " [...] oversees key moments for individual souls in the Mormon progressive plan of salvation." [...] These ideas were expressed throughout the early 1800s. Today, church leaders continue to mention Heavenly Mother, although less frequently and embellished than in early church history. Neal A. Maxwell affirmed the ideas or a homecoming expressed in Snow's poetry about Heavenly Mother by saying, [...] "Could such a regal homecoming be possible without the anticipatory arrangements of a Heavenly Mother?" ...|$|E
