500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a [...] force you to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{year after}} his marriage, Ungaretti {{returned}} to Italy, settling in Rome as a Foreign Ministry employee. By then, Mussolini had organized the March on Rome, which confirmed his seizure of power. Ungaretti [...] joined in the National Fascist Party, signing the pro-fascist Manifesto of the Italian Writers in 1925. In his essays of 1926–1929, republished in 1996, he repeatedly called on the Duce to direct cultural development in Italy and reorganize the Italian Academy on fascist lines. He argued: [...] "The first task of the Academy will be to reestablish a certain connection between men of letters, between writers, teachers, publicists. This people hungers for poetry. If {{it had not been}} for the miracle of Blackshirts, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> leaped this far." [...] In his private letters to a French critic, Ungaretti also claimed that fascist rule did not imply censorship. Mussolini, who did not give a favorable answer to Ungaretti's appeal, prefaced the 1923 edition of Il porto sepolto, thus politicizing its message.|$|E

The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth. On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said [...] "This can {{be the beginning of}} my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in Chennai, in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image..." [...] Nadal was inspired by the Red Cross benefit match against malaria with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, recalling, [...] "We raised an amount of money that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> imagined.

[...] "Even the album title was misunderstood.", Billy Corgan wrote on the band's website that the title Adore “was a joke that no one ever got,” explaining that Adore was meant as a play on “A Door,” meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band’s career. [...] By the end of 1998, Corgan, who would later call the making of Adore [...] "one of the most painful experiences of my life", was already writing material for the band's next album, and Jimmy Chamberlin was readmitted into the band.|$|R

[...] Bono spoke in advance of President Bush at the 54th Annual National Prayer Breakfast, held at the Hilton Washington Hotel on 2 February 2006. In a speech containing biblical references, Bono encouraged the care of the socially and economically depressed. His comments included a call for an extra one percent tithe of the United States' national budget. He brought his Christian views into harmony with other faiths by noting that Christian, Jewish, and Muslim writings all call for the care of the widow, orphan, and stranger. President Bush received praise from the singer-activist for the United States' increase in aid for the African continent. Bono continued by saying much work is left to be done {{to be a part of}} God's ongoing purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest Germanic {{languages}} {{have the}} typical complex inflected morphology of old Indo-European languages, with {{four or five}} noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order. [...] The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing. [...] There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE optative mood) and imperative. [...] Gothic verbs {{had a number of}} archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE mediopassive voice), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect). [...] The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. In three months, the house will still be being built or If you had not acted so stupidly, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been caught) is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, McCaughey was {{assigned}} to the RUC Special Patrol Group, a specialist [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] unit, based in Armagh. McCaughey co-operated extensively with the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade and carried out a number of attacks on their behalf, along with SPG colleagues. He [...] "expressed virulently anti-Catholic views ... and made it known ... that he had strong links to the UVF. A Special Branch recommendation that he be excluded after his probationary period was overridden by an inspector's report that described him as 'one of the best, if not the best, constables attached to my section (of the B Specials)'". McCaughey said of his RUC Special Patrol Group unit: ”Our colour code was Orange and it was Orange by nature and several of us were paramilitaries. Our proud boast was that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a Catholic in it. We did actually have a Catholic once, a guy called Danny from Dungannon. The day after he joined we had him dangling out from the back of a Land Rover with his chin inches from the road. He lasted a week”. In 1977 he was charged with stealing a table from the Mayor of Lisburn Elsie Kelsey's home. McCaughey had been on escort duty for Ulster Unionist Party politician John Taylor, who was attending a party in the house at the time.|$|E
