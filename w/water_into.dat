5|$|The {{classical}} elements {{change into}} one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction. Fire first becomes solidified into air; then air into water; and lastly, <b>water</b> <b>into</b> earth. The process of dissolution {{takes place in the}} reverse order: earth being rarefied into water, <b>water</b> <b>into</b> air and air into fire.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of <b>water</b> <b>into</b> their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting <b>water</b> <b>into</b> irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift <b>water</b> <b>into</b> pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of waste {{products}} produced by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may also help to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping <b>water</b> <b>into</b> {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|More recently, on the International Space Station, the Zvezda module {{includes}} a humidity control system. The water it collects is usually used {{to supply the}} Elektron system that electrolyses <b>water</b> <b>into</b> hydrogen and oxygen, {{but it can be}} used for drinking in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out <b>water</b> <b>into</b> a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject <b>water</b> <b>into</b> wells to be {{heated and}} pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged mine <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, {{the water was}} clear.|$|E

5|$|On Berrow Road, {{near the}} High Lighthouse, numbers 4, 6 and 8 {{were part of}} a terrace built between 1838 and 1841. Number 31 was {{previously}} a lodge. On the corner of Berrow Road and Sea View is a drinking fountain from 1897 with a single dressed stone pier and moulded plinth, topped by a cast iron urn. Each side has the lions head design with those on the north and south sides giving <b>water</b> <b>into</b> a Purbeck Marble bowl.|$|E

5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert <b>water</b> <b>into</b> a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour <b>water</b> <b>into</b> the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
