They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single genus Sitta. Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a superspecies with the chestnut-vented, Indian, chestnut-bellied and Kashmir nuthatches and {{has in the past}} been considered conspecific <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> pieces {{available}} by the 1930s, Gustav Embden proposed a detailed, step-by-step outline of that pathway we now know as glycolysis. The biggest difficulties in determining {{the intricacies of the}} pathway were due to the very short lifetime and low steady-state concentrations of the intermediates of the fast glycolytic reactions. By the 1940s, Meyerhof, Embden and many other biochemists had finally completed the puzzle of glycolysis. The understanding of the isolated pathway has been expanded in the subsequent decades, to include further details of its regulation and integration with other metabolic pathways.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{straightening}} the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as relaxers containing lye, which {{needed to be}} applied by an experienced hairstylist {{so as to avoid}} burning the scalp and ears. In the late 1890s/early 1900s, Madam C. J. Walker also popularized the use of the hot comb in the United States. Those who chose not to artificially treat their hair would often opt to style it into tight braids or cornrows. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> hairstyling methods, one ran the risk of damaging the hair shaft, sometimes resulting in hair loss.|$|E

25|$|It thus fell to Moscheles to {{lead the}} {{counter-attack}} on Wagner after the latter's snide attack on Mendelssohn (and Meyerbeer) in his notorious article Das Judenthum in der Musik ("Jewry in Music"), which he did by requesting the resignation from the conservatory's board of Wagner's editor, Brendel. Like Mendelssohn, Moscheles believed that music had reached its Golden Age during the period Bach to Beethoven, and was suspicious of (although not necessarily antagonistic towards) new directions such as those shown by Wagner, Liszt and Berlioz. Nevertheless, his personal relations <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> (except perhaps Wagner) remained cordial. The Mendelssohn legacy in Britain meant that the Leipzig Conservatory had a high reputation amongst English musicians and amongst those who studied there during Moscheles's time were Arthur Sullivan and Charles Villiers Stanford.|$|E
25|$|Ludovico Cardinal Madruzzo, {{who was the}} {{designated}} leader of the Spanish faction, then arrived in Rome and had conversations with the Spanish and Imperial ambassadors before he entered conclave. Meeting immediately with d' Este, Madruccio learned of d' Este's dislike of his own favorite, Sirleto. Considering that a completely pro-Spanish pope would be as unpalatable as a completely pro-French one, he therefore declared himself to d'Este to be against Cardinal Albani, and thus in favor of Montalto. Altemps, Medici and Gesualdo then put pressure on Madruccio as well, and he was won over. As leader of the Spanish interest, he brought his own influence to bear on Andrew of Austria, Colonna, Deza (Seza), Gonzaga, Sfondrati and Spinola. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> adherents, Medici and d'Este still needed four votes. These could only be had {{in the group of}} Gregory XIII's cardinals organized by Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals. During that night, Cardinal Ferrero arrived.|$|E
25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the way in}} which computer scientists perform risk management, and compares it with risk management in other fields. We find that there are three major problems with risk management: false precision, bad science, and the confusion <b>of</b> facts <b>with</b> values. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> problems can lead to bad decisions, all in the guise of more objective decision-making. But we can learn from these problems and improve the way we do risk management...|$|R

25|$|With {{time as a}} {{critical}} aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration. Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the route of administration, absorption, distribution and metabolism of the medication. A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug {{must be able to}} get to the stomach and stay there. In cases of vomiting and nausea this method of administration is not an option. Suppositories can, in some situations, be administered instead. Medication can also be administered through intramuscular injection, or through intravenous injection. The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug solubility, gastrointestinal motility and pH. If a medication is administered orally the amount of food in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption. Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the blood–brain barrier to the brain. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotics, especially Haloperidol, as well as assorted benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.|$|E

500|$|David Balls from Digital Spy noted Gaga's {{homage to}} her Italian-American {{roots in the}} video, but {{wondered}} if Gaga would [...] "overexpose herself" [...] with the video. Like his review of the single, Moralde found the video to be complimenting the simplistic composition of the song. He believed that with the videos for previous singles, [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga. He explained: [...] "What's striking about it is how much it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and spaghetti and meatballs." [...] He noted that <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> activities, Gaga created an essential fashion dollhouse, by playing feminine characters.|$|E

The crew added an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon and a few misleads as to {{who was trying to}} kill Bart. Even <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> additions, the episode still ran short of time.
