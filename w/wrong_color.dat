The magazine described Gumball as a [...] "strategy-action" [...] game and considered it a useful aid in developing faculties of logic and hand-eye coordination. David Hunter of Softalk asked whether the game was satirical commentary [...] "on the Great American Dream of climbing the corporate ladder" [...] {{depending on whether the}} factory work inculcated [...] "good work habits" [...] or [...] "Disney-esque automatons". He wrote that the game had what corporate trainers would want: an introduction to repetitive tasks and a sense of nervous energy. Three decades later, Jason Koebler of Motherboard summarized that the game never became popular and that copies of it became rare.|$|E
500|$|... "Monty Can't Buy Me Love" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Mark Ervin. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1999. The inspiration for the episode came from the concept of [...] "thrillionaires", a term the Simpsons writers found in an issue of The Economist to describe millionaires who [...] "do really incredible stunts" [...] and [...] "go on amazing adventures". The episode's third act went through several incarnations, and the writers {{had a lot of}} ideas about what Burns should do once he has captured the Loch Ness monster. Eventually, the staff settled on the act's current iteration, which was conceived by Simpsons writer George Meyer. According to current showrunner Al Jean, the color of the Loch Ness monster would originally be green, but when the overseas animation was completed, the Loch Ness monster had a [...] "kind of pinkish" [...] color. Because it would be too expensive to re-color all the cels in which the monster appears, the staff decided to air the episode as it was, even though the monster was in the <b>wrong</b> <b>color.</b> Inside the Fortune Megastore, Simpsons staff writer Ian Maxtone-Graham can be seen.|$|E

[...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, You Have No Idea). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

6000|$|A rule which forbids social {{intercourse}} {{between members}} of different corps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street, and anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group themselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant places, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the green caps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor seem {{to be aware that}} there was such a table in the grounds. The student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore the white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but to none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who were strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and speak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine some of the swords, but an American student said, [...] "It would not be quite polite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will bring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handle freely."

6000|$|... 152. MY DEAR READER,--If {{you have}} been obedient, and have {{hitherto}} done all that I have told you, I trust {{it has not been}} without much subdued remonstrance, and some serious vexation. For I should be sorry if, when you were led by the course of your study to observe closely such things as are beautiful in color, you had not longed to paint them, and felt considerable difficulty in complying with your restriction to the use of black, or blue, or gray. You ought to love color, and to think nothing quite beautiful or perfect without it; and if you really do love it, for its own sake, and are not merely desirous to color because you think painting a finer thing than drawing, there is some chance you may color well. Nevertheless, you need not hope ever to produce anything more than pleasant helps to memory, or useful and suggestive sketches in color, unless you mean to be wholly an artist. You may, in the time which other vocations leave at your disposal, produce finished, beautiful, and masterly drawings in light and shade. But to color well, requires your life. It cannot be done cheaper. The difficulty of doing right is increased--not twofold nor threefold, but a thousandfold, and more--by the addition of color to your work. For the chances are more than a thousand to one against your being right both in form and color with a given touch: it is difficult enough to be right in form, if you attend to that only; but when you have to attend, at the same moment, to a much more subtle thing than the form, the difficulty is strangely increased,--and multiplied almost to infinity by this great fact, that, while form is absolute, so that you can say at the moment you draw any line that it is either right or <b>wrong,</b> <b>color</b> is wholly relative. Every hue throughout your work is altered by every touch that you add in other places; so that what was warm a minute ago, becomes cold when you have put a hotter color in another place, and what was in harmony when you left it, becomes discordant as you set other colors beside it; so that every touch must be laid, not with a view to its effect at the time, but with a view to its effect in futurity, the result upon it of all that is afterwards to be done being previously considered. You may easily understand that, this being so, nothing but the devotion of life, and great genius besides, can make a colorist.|$|E
50|$|In the {{remaining}} combinations of material, bishop and champion, champion and wizard, bishop and knight, and knight and wizard, {{the requirement for}} winning is that the enemy king should be {{kept out of the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>colored</b> corner since the knight alone, or the champion alone cannot defeat the king. Having met this requirement, the mating technique for bishop and champion, and wizard and champion are fairly straightforward, while the technique for bishop and knight is somewhat more complicated. As for knight and wizard, it is possible to set up positions in which the enemy king is corralled, leading to checkmate, but there doesn't seem to be a way of forcing these positions.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is set in}} a world {{polluted}} by microbes {{of different}} colors, which the player must clean up by absorbing them into a UFO. Players control up to 3 UFOs colored red, green and blue that individually can only absorb microbes of their own color. However, by fusing together their UFOs, players can absorb other colors based on additive color mixing. For example, to absorb yellow microbes the red and green UFOs must fuse, while a fusion of all three UFOs will allow the player to absorb white microbes. Players must also avoid absorbing the <b>wrong</b> <b>colored</b> microbe with their UFOs. The game also features a co-operative mode for up to three players that sees each player controlling an individual UFO.|$|R

This paper handles the problem of possible unmatched colors between two stereo views. Based on an approach for multi-view coding efficiency, we present an advanced cumulative histogram matching method for narrow baseline stereo vision. In general results from basic cumulative histogram matching suffers from quantization errors in low dynamic range images. But also <b>wrong</b> <b>colors</b> might be introduced. To avoid such visible errors, we identify depopulated histogram ranges in color matched images. In detected ranges we adjust the mapping function by a constant value which leads to a linearized gradation curve, preserving the dynamic range of the image. Finally, we obtain an artifact free color matched image. Our approach can be applied as a pre- or a post-processing step...|$|R

These unauthorized flags displayed stylized eagle feathers, incorrectly shaped crosses, an incorrectly shaped calument, <b>wrong</b> <b>colors,</b> or combinations of these and other errors. In 2005, an Oklahoma boy scout leader designing patches for a National Jamboree contingent was looking for an image of the Oklahoma state flag and noticed that there were multiple unauthorized designs of the Oklahoma state flag displayed on state government, historical, and educational websites. With some research he was able to identify the official design to use, but because of the prevalence of unauthorized designs, he contacted his state representative, and was the impetus to standardize the colors and shapes by Oklahoma Senate Bill 1359 and signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on May 23, 2006, taking effect on November 1, 2006. A new specialty license plate honoring the first flag was authorized by the legislature and signed into law. A minimum of 100 pre-orders were required and fulfilled.|$|R

When targeting companies is preferred, the style of the commercials should be simple and high-class.
