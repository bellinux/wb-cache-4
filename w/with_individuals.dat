5|$|After a tour in Vienna, Austria and Russian {{language}} {{training at the}} U.S. Army Russian Institute in Oberammergau, Matlock arrived in Moscow {{for the first time}} in 1961. Initially a Vice Consul, Matlock met <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> seeking to visit or emigrate to the United States. His most famous case was Lee Harvey Oswald, who applied for a repatriation loan to return to the United States after having previously moved to the Soviet Union. Indeed, according to the records received by the Warren Commission, in May 1962, Jack Matlock conducted the exit interview which enabled the Oswald family to leave the USSR and return to the USA.|$|E
5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee. Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by Illacme plenipes, <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E

500|$|The Nomura Research Institute (NRI) {{has made}} two major studies into otaku, {{the first in}} 2004 and a revised study with a more {{specific}} definition in 2005. The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of otaku interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, <b>with</b> 350,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥83 billion market scale. Idol otaku were the next largest group, <b>with</b> 280,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥61 billion. Travel otaku <b>with</b> 250,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥81 billion. PC otaku <b>with</b> 190,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥36 billion. Video game otaku <b>with</b> 160,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥21 billion. Automobile otaku <b>with</b> 140,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥54 billion. Animation (anime) otaku <b>with</b> 110,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥20 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment otaku, <b>with</b> 70,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥8 billion; Audio-visual equipment otaku, <b>with</b> 60,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥12 billion; camera otaku, <b>with</b> 50,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥18 billion; fashion otaku, <b>with</b> 40,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥13 billion; and railway otaku, <b>with</b> 20,000 <b>individuals</b> and ¥4 billion. These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the [...] "unique psychological characteristics" [...] of otaku used in the 2005 study.|$|R

5|$|The round ribbontail ray {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in the Indo-Pacific region: it is found from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa northward along the East African coast to the Red Sea, including Madagascar and the Mascarenes; from there, its range extends eastward through the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and Micronesia, occurring {{as far north as}} Korea and southern Japan, and as far south as Australia, where it is found from at least Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia to Stradbroke Island off Queensland, including Lord Howe Island. In the easternmost portion of its range, it has been reported from Cocos Island and the Galápagos Islands, <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> possibly dispersing as far as Central America.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females {{both within and outside}} their core areas, but do not affiliate <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

5|$|While {{the book}} focused on ancient civilizations, the {{majority}} of the film addresses environmental impacts of our current 'global civilization', including the impact of concentrating wealth {{in the hands of the}} 'financial class'. It is filmed as a mixture of interviews <b>with</b> <b>individuals,</b> from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world. Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright's book into a succinct film.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, {{and that they could}} be detected using pendulum dowsing. In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement {{for the establishment of}} an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order. The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{census data}} {{available}} on demographic history or trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary {{on the relative}} number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus. In contrast, Galvin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> revering gods and goddesses henotheistically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati {{and other aspects of}} the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.|$|E
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant, while Moyer's foundation raised US$6million to support underprivileged children. Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 11 attacks, while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
