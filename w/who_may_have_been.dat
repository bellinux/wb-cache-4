5|$|Anna's hold on {{the western}} limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that {{surrounded}} the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (or slightly later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a {{people living in the}} fens <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> settled in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E

5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E
5|$|Ecgfrith succeeded Oswiu as king of Northumbria in 670. Soon after, the Picts rose in {{rebellion}} against Northumbrian subjugation at the Battle of Two Rivers, {{recorded in the}} 8th century by Stephen of Ripon, hagiographer of Wilfrid. Ecgfrith was aided by a sub-king, Beornhæth, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a leader of the}} Southern Picts, and the rebellion ended in disaster for the Northern Picts of Fortriu. Their king, Drest mac Donuel, was deposed and was replaced by Bridei mac Bili.|$|E
5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a sub-king {{until the}} abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, {{seems to have}} remained a pagan. There {{is no evidence that}} Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a Christian, in contrast to his praise of the devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{within a few}} years to decades of the {{destruction}} of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders. Both accounts were compromised at best, and are often taken to be worthless, but they are the only accounts from people <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> familiar with the script first-hand.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht was {{probably}} either a younger son of Rædwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from Rædwald's {{marriage to a}} pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (perhaps in the aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E

Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered certain elements of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a legatus legionis (who had {{an officer}} staff of 6 tribuni militum and one praefectus castrorum), an {{auxiliary}} praefectus {{does not appear}} to have enjoyed the support of purely staff officers. The possible exception is an attested beneficiarius ("deputy"), <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the praefectus' second-in-command, if this title was a regular rank and not simply an ad hoc appointment for a specific task. Also attached to the praefectus were the regiment's vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole unit) and cornucen (horn-blower).|$|E
5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa {{is known}} to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith's date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf's father's name was Cuthberht, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the same person as an ealdorman of that name who {{witnessed}} charters during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa's reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{are divided}} on Hugh Bardulf's ancestry. Katharine Keats-Rohan {{says that he}} was the son of Hamelin Bardulf, a tenant of Hugh Bigod, who held land in Suffolk. Ralph V. Turner, {{revising}} John Horace Round's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says that Hugh was the son of a Hugh Bardulf that died around 1176. According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire. The younger Hugh acquired land at Waddington, Lincolnshire as a tenant of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, sometime in the middle 1140s.|$|E
