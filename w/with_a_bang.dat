5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 2011, Chopra penned {{a three-year}} deal with Ipswich Town signing for an {{undisclosed}} fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be £1.5 million. Manager Paul Jewell revealed {{that he was the}} type of player the club was searching for. After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals. He started his Ipswich years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City. He also scored a goal in each of the two match =es against his former club Cardiff City. He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club. Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.|$|E

I {{was lucky enough to}} work with Arnthor Birgisson, one of the incredible writers from Max Martin’s famous Maratone Studios in Stockholm. We had one day together. He had a huge collection of vintage synths and we ended up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>banging</b> electro club track.".|$|R
25|$|Arkansas {{began the}} season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> as Dennis Johnson {{returned}} the opening kickoff 91 {{yards for a}} touchdown. The Razorbacks also threw for over 400 yards as a team {{for the first time}} in school history.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009, before spring training, {{third baseman}} Alex Rodriguez {{admitted}} to using steroids while {{playing for the}} Texas Rangers during the 2001–2003 seasons. This happened right before a hip injury to Rodriguez, and that stopped his playing time from early March until mid-May. A-Rod would come back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang,</b> having a 3-run homer on the first pitch he had seen since early spring training.|$|E
25|$|The second chapter, Mindwarp, {{was written}} by Philip Martin. Martin's {{character}} Sil, introduced in Vengeance on Varos, was popular among the production team, who asked Martin to feature the character in the cancelled Mission to Magnus. Nathan-Turner asked Martin to include Sil in his chapter, and asked confidentially for Peri to be killed in accordance with Nicola Bryant's wishes to leave the show <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang.</b>|$|E

Though his results were not been spectacular (one Top 5 and four Top 10's), Dillon's results were very consistent (0 DNF's), remaining {{in the hunt for}} a low-end chase berth, and finishing 20th in points, losing Rookie of the Year to Kyle Larson.|$|E
25|$|The Dynamo {{played their}} first seven MLS regular season matches {{on the road}} because BBVA Compass Stadium, the new home of the Dynamo, was being {{constructed}} and eventually opened on May 12, 2012.

25|$|The year 1993 began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang.</b> In January it was {{reported}} that Silja Line had chartered , a ship under construction for Rederi AB Slite, one of the owners of Viking Line. Due to financial troubles Slite could not pay for their new ship, and the shipyard decided to charter it to Silja instead. Later in the same year Silja joined forced with Euroway on their Malmö–Travemünde–Lübeck route. The route proved to be unprofitable and was terminated in spring 1994.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{started off}} the 2007 season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang.</b> They began {{the season with}} a 12–1 start, {{including}} winning their first five games. Their only loss during that time span came against New England, who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first round bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Cowboys lost in the divisional round 21–17 to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle were {{promoted}} {{out of the}} non-league {{conference at}} the first time of asking in 2005, winning the play-off final at the Britannia Stadium, Stoke. Carlisle's excellent form under manager Paul Simpson continued into the following season as {{they returned to the}} Football League <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang,</b> clinching the League Two title. Simpson then departed for Preston North End, and was succeeded by Neil McDonald. The following few seasons saw Carlisle achieve their highest league finishes for 22 years and the highest average crowds for 30 years. This coincided with several seasons at the top half of League One including a playoff finish in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Once {{they had}} decided on their 23 characters, they {{returned}} to London {{for a meeting with}} the BBC. Everyone agreed that EastEnders would be tough, violent on occasion, funny and sharp—set in Margaret Thatcher's Britain—and it would start <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> (namely the death of Reg Cox). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, Nick Cotton was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray. When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.|$|E
25|$|The race started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang,</b> as Senna's hopes {{at a home}} Grand Prix victory were dashed after a {{clash with}} Berger in the first turn. In what {{would prove to be}} a regular {{occurrence}} during the season, the semi-automatic transmission in the Ferrari 640 allowed Berger to get a lightning start from 3rd on the grid and he attempted to go inside of Senna and Patrese into the turn. Patrese got through unscathed and in the lead of his record breaking 177th Grand Prix start whilst Berger was out on the spot (the first of 10 straight retirements for the Austrian driver) while Senna was forced to pit for repairs and would finish the race 2 laps down in 11th place.|$|E
25|$|The game {{opened up}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> for the Hawkeyes, as C.J. Jones took the opening kickoff 100-yards for the touchdown. But {{as it turns}} out, {{it would be the}} only time until late in the fourth quarter that the Hawkeyes would see the endzone. Although the game was tied at halftime, USC blocked Iowa's last-second field goal, {{preventing}} a possible Iowa lead at the half. From there, Heisman winner Carson Palmer went to work. The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession. The USC defense was suffocating and Iowa's miscues were proof. The Hawkeyes had two turnovers, 13 penalties, and multiple missed opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Ryan {{signed a}} lucrative free-agent {{contract}} with the Houston Astros after the 1979 season. The normally light-hitting Ryan got his Houston years started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> in a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 12, 1980, when he hit a three-run home run off Don Sutton. It {{was the first of}} two homers in Ryan's career and produced half of the six RBI he would get that year. On July 4 of that season, at Riverfront Stadium, Ryan recorded his 3,000th career strikeout, the victim being César Gerónimo of the Cincinnati Reds (Gerónimo had also been Bob Gibson's 3,000th strikeout victim, in 1974). Ryan got his third taste of postseason play in 1980, but the Astros were stopped one game short of the World Series.|$|E
25|$|The series {{started out}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang</b> in game one, with Dany Heatley scoring only 28 seconds into the game. That game was later on won by Joe Pavelski in overtime, {{but a good}} {{response}} by the Kings in game two gave them a 4-0 shutout victory in San Jose. In game three, San Jose became the fifth team in NHL playoff history to win a game after facing a 4–0 deficit, where Devin Setoguchi of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime, to make the final score 6-5. Still, at home, Los Angeles lost game four by a score of 6–3. In game five, at San Jose, Los Angeles would win by a score of 3–1. However, {{that would not be}} enough, as Joe Thornton of San Jose scored the game-winning goal in overtime of game six to eliminate Los Angeles from the playoffs, in a 4-2 series win.|$|E
25|$|After scoring 100 not out for Gloucestershire's Second XI in 1964, Shepherd had a {{reasonably}} successful, though late-starting, first class playing career for Gloucestershire, stretching from 1965 to 1979, {{and though he}} never came close to international selection he was popular both with his team-mates and the Gloucestershire supporters. He started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bang,</b> scoring 108 on debut against Oxford University in April 1965, and made eleven more hundreds over the years, though only twice (in 1969 and 1975) did he average over 30. Mainly a middle-order batsman, and never the slimmest of men even in his younger days, he relied more on his fine shot placement than speed across the ground, and his bowling was almost non-existent: he took only two wickets in his entire first-class career. One famous incident at the Gloucestershire Cricket Club saw Shepherd hitting the ball so hard into the crowd that it knocked out a spectator reading a newspaper. The spectator was taken to hospital and recovered with only minor injuries.|$|E
60|$|The captain shut up the {{telescope}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emphatic <b>bang,</b> {{by way of}} termination to his remark, and, turning on his heel, paced the deck rapidly {{by the side of}} his mate.|$|R
