5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a <b>wagon</b> with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the <b>wagon</b> to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the <b>wagon</b> and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Rose–Baley Party was {{the first}} European American {{emigrant}} <b>wagon</b> train to traverse the 35th parallel route known as Beale's <b>Wagon</b> Road, established by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico to the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 the Deutsche Bahn {{had about}} 12,000 hopper <b>wagons,</b> 10,000 saddle-bottomed <b>wagons</b> and 1,000 side-tipping <b>wagons.</b> In {{addition}} to hopper and saddle-bottomed <b>wagons</b> {{there were also}} <b>wagons</b> with opening roofs.|$|R

5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a <b>wagon</b> train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned <b>wagon.</b> When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Charles and Ames {{established}} the Holt Brothers Company in San Francisco. The company sold hardwood, lumber, and <b>wagon</b> and carriage materials, primarily manufacturing <b>wagon</b> axles, wheels, and frames. W.Harrison Holt and Ames both temporarily returned around 1871 to New Hampshire – where both were married – {{to manage the}} eastern business. The brothers built a factory in Concord, New Hampshire, to manufacture <b>wagon</b> wheels, wheel components, bodies and running gear. In 1872, at age 23, Benjamin was given an interest in his father's business, and he assumed more responsibility for the company's operations. W.Harrison Holt moved to Tiffin, Ohio, to manage the company's lumber business there, where he remained until the early 1880s. Their mother died in 1875, and their father died eight years later in 1883. After his father's death, Benjamin Holt left New Hampshire in 1883 to help Charles build the business in California.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the railway era, the vast majority of goods <b>wagons</b> were four-wheeled vehicles of simple construction. These were almost exclusively small covered <b>wagons,</b> open <b>wagons</b> with side-boards, and flat <b>wagons</b> with or without stakes.

5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} <b>wagon</b> master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the <b>wagon</b> her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E

50|$|Introduction of the VHHY class <b>wagons</b> allowed {{cascading}} of {{the older}} <b>wagons</b> for then-new rice traffic, developing in the north-eastern areas of the state; these <b>wagons</b> were coded VHRF/X. Records {{are hard to find}} but it appears a fairly random assortment of <b>wagons</b> were converted, totalling at least 23 <b>wagons.</b> Photographed <b>wagons</b> include 12 and 16 as VHRX and 22, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 36, 39, 40, 43, 44, 59-61, 65-67, 69, 70, 72 and 78 as VHRF; based on this it seems reasonable to assume that other conversions, if any, would have come from the aluminium-built group of <b>wagons.</b> Since the Pacific National takeover these <b>wagons</b> have all reverted to their previous grain classifications.|$|R
5000|$|One {{arrangement}} {{used at the}} Dinorwic Quarry {{was known}} as the [...] "Ballast" [...] method. This involved a two track incline with one track reserved for fully loaded <b>wagons</b> and the second used by partially loaded <b>wagons.</b> The line used by the partially loaded <b>wagons</b> {{was known as the}} [...] "ballast" [...] track and it had a stop placed on it part way down. The distance {{from the top of the}} incline to the stop was the same as the distance that the fully loaded <b>wagons</b> needed to travel. Empty <b>wagons</b> were hauled up the incline, counterbalanced by the descending ballast <b>wagons.</b> These empty <b>wagons</b> were replaced by fully loaded <b>wagons</b> ready to descend. The descending loaded <b>wagons</b> then returned the ballast <b>wagons</b> to the top of the incline. One of the major inclines at Dinorwic had four parallel tracks, two worked by the ballast method and two as conventional gravity balance.|$|R

5|$|A {{slightly}} later route {{along the}} parallel was a <b>wagon</b> road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19thcentury, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who {{stayed in the}} area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} artwork is {{displayed}} on {{the exterior of the}} building. Sculptor Leo Friedlander used Vermont marble for the large relief sculptures {{on both sides of the}} main entrance. One sculpture depicts Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and Sacagawea, with a map of their expedition's route on the reverse (Lewis and Clark); the other (Covered <b>Wagon)</b> shows pioneers and a covered <b>wagon,</b> with a map of the Oregon Trail on the reverse. Additionally, Ellerhusen created five marble relief sculptures on the exterior, and a metal sculpture by Tom Morandi sits above the south entrance. Ellerhusen also cast six bronze sculptures arranged above the building's main entrance, three on the inside and three on the outside.|$|E

5|$|After 1860 handcarts were {{no longer}} used.

5|$|Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors {{attacked}} the first emigrant <b>wagon</b> train to use Beale's <b>Wagon</b> Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman to pacify the tribe. Following {{a series of}} confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed {{near the site of}} the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's Aha macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.|$|E
5|$|Angus McKinnon and Morris A. Ruffner {{filed the}} first copper mining claims at this {{location}} in 1876. In 1880, Frederick A. Tritle, {{the governor of}} the Arizona Territory, and Frederick F. Thomas, a mining engineer from San Francisco, bought these claims from the original owners. In 1883, with the aid of eastern financiers including James A. MacDonald and Eugene Jerome of New York City, they created the United Verde Copper Company. The small adjacent mining camp on Cleopatra Hill was named Jerome in honor of Eugene Jerome, who became the company secretary. United Verde built a small smelter at Jerome and constructed <b>wagon</b> roads from it to Prescott, the Verde Valley, and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad depot at Ash Fork. However, transport by <b>wagon</b> was expensive, and in late 1884 after the price of copper had fallen by 50percent, the company ceased all operations at the site.|$|E

For mineral traffic four wheeled steel sided dropside open <b>wagons</b> were used. Some had brake-huts. There were also ten bogie opens. Another fifty bogie <b>wagons</b> were ordered by the Mines de Barbery in 1914, {{but it is not}} known if these were delivered.|$|R

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his <b>wagon</b> while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the <b>wagon,</b> grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
