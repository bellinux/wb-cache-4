5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> {{dictatorship}} {{finance minister}} Martinez de Hoz assumed power, inflation was equivalent {{to an annual}} rate of 5000%, and output had declined sharply. In 1976, the era of import substitution was ended, and the government lowered import barriers, liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing, and supported the peso against foreign currencies.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> junta came to power, the IAe 33 {{project was}} thrown into disarray. The new {{government}} released many of the leading air force staff; similarly, most of Tank's team {{was forced to leave}} Argentina with Tank himself going to India, where he worked for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and later developed the HF-24 Marut supersonic fighter.|$|E
5|$|Portions of JSOC {{units have}} made up the {{constantly}} changing special operations task force, operating in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as Task Force 121, it was formed {{in the summer of}} 2003, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E

5|$|While {{waiting for}} help to arrive, they make phone calls to their {{respective}} families. A lone creature silently approaches the station. Hiding, Samantha observes several tentacles exploring {{the inside of the}} store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. Samantha quickly unplugs the television and the creature loses interest. Another creature appears, and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. The chronological ending takes place {{at the beginning of the}} film, filmed in green night vision sight, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> rescue team is attacked by a single creature.|$|E
5|$|Air Europe {{fell under}} {{financial}} distress in 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in Norway Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had to refinance the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally {{to operate the}} charters. The aircraft were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on the aircraft expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but Norway Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coward {{acquired}} Goldenhurst Farm, in Aldington, Kent, {{making it}} his home {{for most of}} the next thirty years, except <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> used it during the Second World War. It is a Grade II listed building. In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press. He first settled in Bermuda but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of Les Avants, near Montreux), which remained his homes {{for the rest of his}} life. His expatriate neighbours and friends included Joan Sutherland, David Niven, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards in Switzerland and Ian Fleming and his wife Ann in Jamaica. Coward was a witness at the Flemings' wedding, but his diaries record his exasperation with their constant bickering.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1926, Hu Lanqi left home for Guangzhou to work for He Xiangning, Minister of Women's Affairs of the Kuomintang (KMT) government. The {{following}} year, she became a cadet of the Whampoa Military Academy in Wuhan and enlisted in the KMT's National Revolutionary Army, which was then waging the Northern Expedition against the warlords. She {{was one of a}} small number of women recruits, which included Xie Bingying and Zhao Yiman. After initial success, the KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek turned against the Communists, who had been until then allied with the KMT, and committed the Shanghai massacre in April 1927. The Wuhan-based left wing of the KMT, who were sympathetic to the Communists, capitulated to Chiang's right wing. Hu Lanqi was discharged from the army <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> academy was dissolved in July 1927. Instead of returning home, she continued to work for the left-wing KMT leader He Xiangning, helping her unionize female workers. She broke up with her second husband whose political views differed from hers.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} independence and {{sovereignty of the}} Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960. Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991. The armed forces are {{under the direction of}} the Minister of the Interior and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.|$|E

5|$|Wilder-Neligan's initial {{role was}} as a deputy {{district}} officer for the garrison of Rabaul {{on the island of}} Neupommern (later renamed New Britain). In May 1921, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> administration of the former German colony was handed over to an Australian civil one mandated by the League of Nations, he was transferred to the administration of the newly created Territory of New Guinea as district officer for Talasea in west New Britain. Early in January 1923, the Administrator, Evan Wisdom, summoned him to Rabaul to answer allegations of financial malpractice that had been made against him by a former German planter. It appears that he resigned and sailed for Rabaul. Going ashore to rest for a few days at the village of Ekerapi before continuing his journey, he died during the night of 9/10 January. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died intestate and with debts.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, amidst heavy {{fighting}} in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, General Ngô Quang Trưởng flew out to Saigon {{for a meeting with}} President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. In this meeting, President Thiệu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps Tactical Zone, and ordered General Trưởng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division (South Vietnam) would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Trưởng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thiệu to reverse his decision in the belief that he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions. After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Trưởng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thiệu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince the President that most South Vietnamese units were still intact, and that they still had the time to recapture lost territories. And secondly, General Trưởng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> situation in I Corps was still under control.|$|E
