[...] But {{he got out of}} the clutches of white thieves finally for fifty dollars instead of the three hundred which they had decided to mulct him of. He had sold a fat steer and had to wait the month to get his check and that delay he was ‘sorry’ for. [...] Had the Indian collected a drove of ponies from a white man’s ranch and tied them in a livery 20 miles away, and tried the same kind of ruse on the owner, do we guess that he would escape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuckle,</b> as these whites did? [...] No indeed, the law would make good the white man’s claims against the Indian, sure and to the limit, but laws were made by the white man for the white man! ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 11, 1970 Cavett {{hosted a}} tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Along with Coward, the other guests were Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, [...] and Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford (who were enjoying a {{successful}} run on Broadway in the revival of Coward's play Private Lives). In reviewing the show for The New York Times, television critic Jack Gould said [...] "The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett's show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show…and the badinage was warm and delightful...a fun night, and to take out of context a line or here or there could not convey the whole. To go to bed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuckle</b> provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough." [...] (Jack Gould, The New York Times, February 12, 1970, p.59) ...|$|E
