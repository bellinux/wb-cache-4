25|$|The colony {{system is}} {{succeeding}} because it isn't simply church for an hour, but working {{together all the}} time for mutual good. We are not making empty members. All the ministers {{and many of the}} members have helped in the building of this SRF Lake Shrine. That is the secret. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> for God and commune with Him. I believe that America is a wonderful country in which to try out brotherhood colonies, wherein mankind can learn that the first principle of life is happiness.|$|E
25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>work,</b> and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, 2008, Secretary Paulson said in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “As we {{work our}} way through this turbulence, our highest {{priority}} is limiting {{its impact on the}} real economy. We must maintain stable, orderly and liquid financial markets and our banks must continue to play their vital role of supporting the economy by making credit available to consumers and businesses. And we must of course focus on housing, which precipitated the turmoil in the capital markets, and is today the biggest downside risk to our economy. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> to limit the impact of the housing downturn on the real economy without impeding the completion of the necessary housing correction. I will address each of these in turn. Regulators and policy makers are vigilant; we are not taking anything for granted.” ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{some will}} say: [...] "He {{does not give}} freely; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> and struggle. Why do you mock poor hard-worked creatures with such words as these?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But we {{will talk}} more of this afterwards. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> set to <b>work</b> to {{separate}} the galleys, or we shall have them grinding each other to pieces. Then <b>we</b> <b>must</b> hasten to the assistance of our friends." ...|$|R
60|$|Do we not, {{from this}} very principle, {{prohibit}} the planting tobacco in England, though our own land would produce it? Do we not {{know there are}} coals in Blackheath, Muzzle-hill, and other places, but that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not <b>work</b> them that we may not hurt the navigation? The reason {{is exactly the same}} here.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is sad, I confess, but not hopeless, Herr Westervelt. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> {{the harder}} {{to let the}} {{thoughtful}} people of the city know {{what we are trying}} to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we haven't an understudy," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "There's {{something}} in that. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work!</b> My goodness, that kid's a bad study. I've known deaf-mutes {{who would have}} learned the part quicker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rippin'! Oh, rippin'!" [...] said Dick Four. [...] "Only we shan't {{have any}} piano on the night. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> {{it with the}} banjoes--play an' dance at the same time. You try, Tertius." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{news that}} there will be trouble to-night, so <b>we</b> <b>must</b> set to <b>work</b> at once to place the chests in safety. First let them clear out the wood- cellar." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd have telegraphed {{to you if}} I'd known {{where you}} were. But there's no help for spilt milk. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> get to <b>work</b> now,--that's all. I suppose you're for disestablishing the Church?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "D'ye think so," [...] said Roy with a grin, [...] "well, that bein' the case, let's go and fix our camp, {{for the sun}} is {{not given}} to sitting up all night in these parts, so <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> while it shines." ...|$|E
40|$|Through its {{innovative}} operations, and its facilitation {{of dynamic}} communities of researchers, development experts, policy makers, producers and consumers, this CGIAR Challenge Program goes beyond research for development as usually practiced. Yet, paradoxically {{for a program}} well-versed in technical and social complexity, the CPWF approach is simple: to effectively address a shared problem, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> first <b>work</b> together. 2008 CGIAR Annual Report. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious, Bill! Why, {{the ship}} is ever so far behind. It is two miles, I should think, from the town. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> set to <b>work</b> or we shan't be back in time for dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No matter," [...] {{said the}} Captain, {{laughing}} at Alf's forlorn look, [...] "the sun will soon dry it. So long as nothing is broken or torn, we'll get on very well. But now, boys, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> go to <b>work</b> with oars. There must be no flagging in this dash for the Pole. It's a neck-or-nothing business. Now, mark my orders. Although we've got four oars apiece, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> only <b>work</b> {{two at a}} time. I know that young bloods like you are prone to go straining yourselves at first, an' then bein' fit for nothing afterwards. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> keep it up steadily. Two in each boat will pull at a time for one hour, while the other two rest or sleep, and so on, shift about; till another breeze springs up. Don't fold it up tight, Alf. Leave it pretty slack till it is dry, and then put on its belt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, captain," [...] replied Ned; [...] "but I fear you'll {{have to go}} by yourself, for <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> {{out this}} claim {{as fast as we}} can, seeing that the miners further down won't be long of scenting out our discovery." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> fast if {{we would}} have all those fetters cut before the door gave way. Now a panel crashed inward upon the floor, and Mors Kajak sprang to the opening to defend the way until we should have time to release the others.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{my mission}} has failed.

6000|$|... "Perhaps, some day, a {{different}} {{system will be}} employed. There will be special schools for lads intended for various professions, and careers. Till that is done, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> all <b>work</b> upon a common basis; which has at least the advantage of forming the mind, for the after work of acquiring the special branches of knowledge required, by us, in the careers we may adopt.|$|R

And, besides, that wouldn't do. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> our own line, {{especially}} at the very beginning.

6000|$|... "He {{might seem}} that, but I {{happen to know}} other things about him. He is an unmitigated scoundrel. Of course, not a word must be said about it, Lady Greendale.

6000|$|... "From {{morning to}} night; and now <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>work</b> harder than ever, {{with one of}} the boys in Montreal and wheat going down.

5000|$|... "Demand {{for natural}} gas is not going away, and neither is {{hydraulic}} fracturing. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> be clear-eyed about this, and fight to protect {{public health and the}} environment from unacceptable impacts. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> also <b>work</b> hard to put policies in place that ensure that natural gas serves as an enabler of renewable power generation, not an impediment to it. We fear that those who oppose all natural gas production everywhere are, in effect, making it harder for the U.S. economy to wean itself from dirty coal." ...|$|R
