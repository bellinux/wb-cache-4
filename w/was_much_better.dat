With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet.

5|$|Having now gained {{experience}} with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, Final Fantasy V (1992), <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that of IV. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like IV, the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album {{in addition to the}} main soundtrack album.|$|E

5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{historians of}} this period, such as Hans-Jürgen Lüsebrink, Simon Schama and Monique Cottret, concur {{that the actual}} {{treatment}} of prisoners in Bastille <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the public impression left through these writings. Nonetheless, fuelled by the secrecy that still surrounded the Bastille, official as well as public concern about the prison and the system that supported it also began to mount, prompting reforms. As early as 1775, Louis XVI's minister Malesherbes had authorised all prisoners to be given newspapers to read, and {{to be allowed to}} write and to correspond with their family and friends. In the 1780s Breteuil, the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi, began a substantial reform of the system of lettres de cachet that sent prisoners to the Bastille: such letters were now required to list the length of time a prisoner would be detained for, and the offence for which they were being held.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes's most {{successful}} seasons {{in terms of}} wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902. In these years, Rhodes took 725 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.07, taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times, assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive County Championships. In 1900, Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made pitches helpful to his bowling. In 1901, the weather <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> leading to pitches that were good for batting, but Rhodes took 251 wickets, an achievement described by Wisden as astonishing. Against MCC that year, Rhodes scored his maiden first-class century, batting at number nine. In the 1902 season, Rhodes took 213 wickets, fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable pitches in a wet summer. This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{suffered}} an injury-hit and frustrating {{season in the}} 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only fivegoals in 19games in the league. The 2001–02 season <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> though; Shearer bagged 23goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they would qualify for the following season's Champions League competition. One {{of the most memorable}} incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4–3 win over the Red Devils in September 2001. Shearer also saw red {{for the second time in}} his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic. The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{resistance}} was fortunate for the Allies due to unexpectedly poor beach conditions. While the limited pre-invasion intelligence suggested that Red and White beaches {{were capable of}} supporting an amphibious landing, they were in fact highly unsuitable for this purpose. Both beaches were muddy and difficult for landing craft to approach owing to rocky ridges and coral reefs. As a result, soldiers and equipment had to be landed through deep surf. This delayed the operation and caused a large quantity of equipment to be damaged. Like many of his soldiers, General MacArthur was forced to wade through chest-high surf when he came ashore. On the morning of D-Day a survey party determined that a beach on the south coast of Morotai <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> suited to LSTs. This beach, which was designated Blue Beach, became the primary Allied landing point from 16 September.|$|E
5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed {{to reduce the number}} to 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles for all of the tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that he would have preferred to keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time as the group was {{rejected}} by Nintendo, Romero was approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software, who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous Pyramids of Egypt—an adventure game where the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee's shareware model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero said he could not, as Pyramids of Egypt was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better,</b> and sent Miller the Mario demo. Miller was impressed, and the Ideas from the Deep agreed to create a new game for Apogee before Christmas of 1990—only a few months away—split into three parts to match Apogee's shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole. Hall suggested a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme, and developed a short introduction that convinced the team to make Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the World War, {{two governments}} claimed to be the {{legitimate}} governments of Poland: Dmowski's in Paris and Piłsudski's in Warsaw. To {{put an end to the}} rival claims of Piłsudski and Dmowski, the composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski met with both men and persuaded them to reluctantly join forces. Both men had something that the other needed. Piłsudski was in possession of Poland after the war, but as the Pole who had fought with the Austrians for the Central Powers against the Russians, he was distrusted by the Allies. Piłsudski's newly reborn Polish Army, formed from his Polish Legions, needed arms from the Allies, something that Dmowski <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> suited to persuade the Allies to deliver upon. Beyond that, the French were planning to send the Blue Army of General Józef Haller — loyal to Dmowski – back to Poland. The fear was that if Piłsudski and Dmowski did not put aside their differences, a civil war might break out between their partisans. Paderewski was successful in working out a compromise in which Dmowski and himself were to represent Poland at the Paris Peace Conference while Piłsudski was to serve as provisional president of Poland. Not all of Dmowski's supporters accepted this compromise, and on 5 January 1919, Dmowski's partisans (led by Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Eustachy Sapieha) attempted a failed coup against Piłsudski.|$|E
5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> understood, {{and a new}} {{attempt was}} made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, {{who had been the}} engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, to carry out a survey. The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, all rightist {{parties had}} been outlawed, {{and a new}} pro-government Democratic Bloc was formed in 1947 which {{included}} only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the first parliamentary elections took place featuring primarily PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party, whose strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution. Results were adjusted by Stalin himself to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords. The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics. After the referendum dress rehearsal, the vote fraud <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, a NKVD colonel charged with the election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new Sejm, out of 444 seats, 27 were given to Mikołajczyk's party. Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who declared the results to be falsified and was threatened with arrest or worse, fled the country and other opposition leaders also left. Western governments did not act further and the Poles felt abandoned again. In the same year, the new Sejm created the Small Constitution of 1947. Over the next two years, the communists monopolized their political power in Poland.|$|E

5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E
