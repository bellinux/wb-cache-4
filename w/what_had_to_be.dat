In general, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rejected {{is not necessarily}} the complement of <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accepted. This phenomenon is commonly known as the heterogeneous bipolar nature of expressing information needs. Satisfaction degrees in regular fuzzy querying approaches are based on the 'symmetric' assumption that {{the extent to which a}} database record respectively satisfies and does not satisfy a given query are complements of each other and are therefore less suited to adequately handle heterogeneous bipolarity in query specifications and query processing. In this paper we present a bipolar query satisfaction modelling framework which is based on couples that consist of an independent degree of satisfaction and degree of dissatisfaction. The use and advantages of the framework are illustrated in the context of fuzzy query evaluation in regular relational databases. More specifically, the evaluation of heterogeneous bipolar queries that contain both positive and negative criteria is studied...|$|R

500|$|Nomura {{remained}} as co-director alongside Tabata so the project could remain as true {{to the original}} vision as possible, after which he was reassigned to other projects within the company including Kingdom Hearts III, while Tabata took up full directorial duties to bring the project to completion. The separate engine, gameplay, graphics and design sections of the team were also merged into one unit to help with development. Tabata officially became director in December 2013. Development initially followed the pattern of previous high-budget games, but the team eventually realized that such techniques had become dated. During the later part of development, Tabata's main concern was keeping the game on schedule instead of letting the development become delayed by experimentation with the technology. The company also kept the game's budget under strict control, despite the prolonged development. A major issue was deciding what elements to carry over and <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed or discarded, as the project was already known and fans had expectations. When describing his attitude to development, Tabata described the team set-up as [...] "horizontal", using a non-hierarchical staff structure to help speed up the exchange of information and feedback between departments. This drastic shift was unheard of for major Japanese game developers, and was met with a mixed reaction from staff: some were elated at their new freedom, while others felt downgraded. Including the initial work on Versus XIII, the game's development spanned approximately ten years from conception to release: despite its origins, Tabata considers Versus XIII and XV to be two separate entities.|$|E

2500|$|In The Methods of Ethics, Henry Sidgwick asked, [...] "Is it total or average {{happiness}} that {{we seek to}} make a maximum?" [...] He {{noted that}} aspects of the question had been overlooked and answered the question himself by saying that <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maximized was the average multiplied {{by the number of}} people living. He also argued that, if the [...] "average happiness enjoyed remains undiminished, Utilitarianism directs us to make the number enjoying it as great as possible." [...] This was also the view taken earlier by Paley. He notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, [...] "the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions" [...] and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, [...] "the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever." [...] A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that all other things being equal a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.|$|E

40|$|Foreign {{policy is}} usually over-determined. The “national interest” often appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{immutable}} dictation {{of the international}} system and of domestic politics. As Henry Kissinger put it when he was Secretary of State, “the essential outlines of U. S. policy will remain the same no matter who wins the U. S. Presidential election” (Wittkopf, 2003, 524). Yet sometimes, “reality” is more malleable than it first appears. Not so long ago, it seemed “unimaginable” that the Soviet Union would disappear and Germany would be peacefully reunited. As former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft put it in 2003, the main divisions in foreign policy today are not between liberals and conservatives, but between the traditionalists and the transformationalists. 1 The transformationalists believe that “we know <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and <b>have</b> the power <b>to</b> do it. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>is</b> <b>to</b> transform the Middle East into a collection of democracies.
