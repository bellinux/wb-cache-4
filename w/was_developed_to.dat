5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|All GameCube {{systems support}} {{the display of}} {{stereoscopic}} 3D, and Luigi's Mansion <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> utilize this feature. However, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was never enabled outside of development.|$|E

40|$|An {{interdigital}} {{capacitive sensor}} has <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> characterize the permittivity of wire insulation. A theoretical model has <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> calculate the capacitance {{of such a}} sensor that is in intimate contact with {{the surface of a}} double-layer cylindrical dielectric surrounding a conductive core. The cylindrical form of the electrostatic Green’s function due to an exterior point source is utilized, with the final capacitance value being calculated using the Method of Moments.

5|$|Despite {{the seaside}} location, few {{residents}} {{make their living}} on the sea, and fishing {{is not a major}} industry. In the early 1970s, when fish stocks ran low, a system of rotating access <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> preserve this sector. This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. In 2007, locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores, which have opened branches in Alanya.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Horace Holly – protagonist and narrator, Holly is a Cambridge {{man whose}} keen intellect and {{knowledge}} <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> compensate for his ape-like appearance. Holly knows {{a number of}} ancient languages, including Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, which allow him {{to communicate with the}} Amahagger (who speak a form of Arabic) and She (who knows all three languages). Holly's interest in archaeology and the origins of civilisation lead him to explore the ruins of Kôr.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 a new {{master plan}} called 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> guide future campus development. Amongst the {{recommendations}} {{it called for}} the removing of central campus parking to parking garages replacing it with green space, the removal of head-in parking around West and East Circle Drives, adding more bike lanes and planting more trees on south campus {{in order to give}} it {{the look and feel of}} north campus.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Navy {{unveiled}} a $4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island. The Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> save on training costs with a reusable facility which could emulate electronic, mine and anti-air warfare scenarios instead of real-world training requiring fuel, logistics and deployment costs for ships.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{developments}} in the military sphere during the Late Middle Ages was {{the increased use of}} infantry and light cavalry. The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears.|$|E

5|$|Public {{transport}} in the county, {{including the}} extensive network of trams, buses and the London Underground came under {{control of the}} London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 and a New Works Programme <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> further enhance services during the 1930s. Partly because of its proximity to the capital, the county had a major role during the Second World War. The county was subject to aerial bombardment and contained various military establishments, such as RAF Uxbridge and RAF Heston, which {{were involved in the}} Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The A320 family <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> {{compete with}} the 737 Classics (-300/-400/-500) and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80/90 series, and has since faced {{challenges}} from the Boeing 737 Next Generation (-600/-700/-800/-900) and the 717 during its two decades in service. As of 2010, {{as well as the}} 737, the A320 family faces competition from Embraer's E-195 (to the A318), and the CSeries being developed by Bombardier to the A318/A319.|$|E
5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles {{large volumes}} of data which pose a {{significant}} storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E

The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.|$|E
5|$|The Territory officially {{became the}} Australian Capital Territory in 1938. Canberra {{was built to}} {{accommodate}} the government, while the surrounding area <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> support the city, including the construction of dams, the establishment of plantation forests {{and the creation of}} protected areas. An advisory council was established in 1930, with some elected representation.|$|E
5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light {{on to the}} sides of a ship so as to make its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E
