40|$|Forging, milling, turning, {{grinding}} {{and shaping}} etc. are the various industrial manufacturing processes which generate the metal <b>waste.</b> <b>Grinding</b> is extensively {{used in the}} finishing operation. The waste generated contains significant impurities apart from the metal particles. Due to these significant impurities, it becomes difficult to process and gets usually dumped in the landfills which create environmental problems. Therefore, it becomes essential to reuse metal waste to create value added products. Powder injection molding process is used for producing the porous metal matrix framework. This paper discusses the presented design of the porous framework {{to be used for}} the liquid filter application. Different parameters are optimized to obtain the better strength framework with variable porosity. Carbon nanotubes are used as reinforcing materials to enhance the strength of the metal matrix framework...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 82) This study {{attempted to}} determine the physical and microbiological effects of ground hospital solid waste materials on a selected part of the sanitary sewerage system of the City of Los Angeles. The quality of the sewage {{and the effect of}} the sewage on the sewer pipelines were examined during the study. Ground solid waste materials were introduced into the disposal system of two hospitals. Two specially designed solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> units were installed in a major hospital which was connected to a relatively large, fast-flowing sewer line. A third grinder was installed in a smaller facility which was connected to a sewer line of minimum size and flow. A small number of sewage samples were withdrawn {{prior to the start of}} solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> and samples were withdrawn monthly for the duration of the investigation. Existing criteria and methods for physical and microbiological analyses of sewage were employed for all samples. Existing methods for evaluation of sewer pipelines were also employed. All sewage samples were analyzed by the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Standards Laboratory. Pipeline tests were performed by the City's industrial waste control officials. Sewage samples were withdrawn from a point slightly downstream from each hospital's connection to the sewer line. The results of analyses of sewage samples taken before and during the grinding operations were compared to one another and to the Los Angeles City's maximum legal levels allowed for discharge of sewage into a sewer. The same results were also compared to the average results of similar tests performed on sewage entering the City's main sewage treatment plant during the year 1968. Based on the comparative results of these analyses, it was concluded that addition of ground hospital solid wastes apparently had no significant effect on the sewage. Additional tests of this type are needed, however, before positive conclusions may be drawn. Several recommendations for similar future studies were made. Based on the results of pipeline evaluations, it was concluded that heavier solid waste materials may tend to settle in sewers with a slow rate of flow. There appeared to be no deleterious effects of ground hospital wastes on the sewer lines, however. Recommendations were made for this phase of future studies, including evaluating the condition of the pipelines prior to the start of grinding (which was not done in this study). The study results must be considered provisional in nature. Further investigation into this method of hospital solid waste disposal, however, could lead to a potential solution for a major public health problem...|$|E

This report describes a hydrometallurgical process that demonstrated on a laboratory scale that 79 pct of the chromium, 97 pct of the cobalt, 99 pct of the manganese, 99 pct of the nickel, and 90 pct of the tungsten could be recovered in chemical form from hardface alloy <b>grinding</b> <b>waste.</b> The process involved deoiling the <b>grinding</b> <b>waste,</b> followed by chloride-based dissolution of the deoiled material.

Amine extractants were used to extract the iron, cobalt, and manganese; decanal oxime was used to extract the nickel.

Unfortunately, such thicknesses emphasize the limitations of the process, which are overcome by plating extra thickness then grinding down and lapping to meet requirements or to improve the overall aesthetics of the [...] "chromed" [...] piece. [...] Increasing plating thickness amplifies surface defects and roughness in proportional severity, because hard chrome does not have a leveling effect.

The effluent (permeate) from the ultrafiltration system is usually of sufficient quality for discharge to a sanitary sewer system.

The recycled glass powders are prepared by crushing and <b>grinding</b> <b>waste</b> glass bottles to a particles size distribution below than 75 µm. The raw materials (recycled glass powder and ball clay) are characterised by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and its composition is determine by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). The recycled glass powder are then mixed with the ball clay according to the ratio of SLSG to ball clay of 95 : 5 wt. %, 90 : 10 wt. % and 85 : 15 wt. %. Green samples of glass ceramic are then fabricated using Cold Isostatic Pressing (CIP) with constant pressure at 40 MPa. Sintering process is conducted at three different temperatures at 750 °C, 850 °C and 950 °C with 1 h holding time.

Tramp oil originates as lubrication oil seeping out from the slideways and washing into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which the steel supplier coats the bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases, it {{can be seen as a}} film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating specks of oil. A tramp oil level above 2 % could cause health issues due to emulsification [18]. Scenario 3 {{consists of the}} basic coolant mixed with 10 % oil and around 10 g of ferrous material chips in near-powdered form [19]. Generally the effluent <b>waste</b> from a <b>grinding</b> machine includes minute particles of iron and worn-out or burnt-out abrasives from the wheel, which are difficult to segregate from the used coolant. The complexity of the fluid is compounded by contamination from a combination of substances from the manufacturing process, such as tramp oils, hydraulic fluids, and particulate matter from the machining operations [19]. Scenario 4 consists of 10 % sludge mixed with the basic coolant. Sludge is a heavy residue that lies at the bottom of the sump or in a drum where the used coolants are stored before disposal. Microorganisms such as bacteria tend to multiply and grow in the sludge that is present in the effluent waste. Scenario 5 consists of the basic coolant mixed with 10 % sludge and 2 % solvent.
