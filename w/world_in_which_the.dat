5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|The Cohen {{family home}} was shot on {{location}} in Malibu. A mock pool house was built {{for use in the}} pilot, and taken down after filming completed. The Cohen's home was recreated on a soundstage at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach for filming {{during the rest of the}} series; external shots of the house remained in use. The fashion show was filmed at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre; though it did not advance the story, Schwartz described it as necessary to show the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> characters lived. The party at Holly's beach house following the fashion show was filmed at a beach house in Malibu over three consecutive nights.|$|E
5|$|Dwarf Fortress (officially called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) {{is a part}} {{construction}} and management simulation, part roguelike, indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. Freeware and in development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. The primary game mode {{is set in a}} procedurally generated fantasy <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> player indirectly controls a group of dwarves, and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy underground fortress. Critics praised its complex, emergent gameplay but had mixed reactions to its difficulty. The game influenced Minecraft and was selected among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming in 2012.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{agent-based}} model of virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> have agency, that is, the objects can sense their environment, reason about their goals, and make {{changes to the}} environment. The agent-based model has the following reasoning processes: interpretation, hypothesizing, and action activation. This agent model is described and illustrated using a wall agent in a multi-user virtual world. We extend the illustration through a demonstration of a multi-agent <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> many of <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> the <b>world</b> interactively reason {{about the use of}} the world and respond specifically to the people <b>in</b> the <b>world...</b>|$|R

This {{is probably a}} reference to New Zealand Golf Club (founded 1895) on Woodham Lane - the road from Woking to Addlestone - and not the Abbey Moor Golf Course which was only established in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Super Mario 64 DS is a 3D {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls four different characters through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars, 30 more than the original game. Each level is an enclosed <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask for help. The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at {{by the name of}} the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As the player collects stars, more areas of the castle become accessible.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional <b>world,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} higher {{dimensional}} models (brane <b>worlds)</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> scale of quantum gravity M ∗ {{is much smaller}} than the apparent scale MP ∼ 10 19 GeV are in conflict with bounds arising from holography and black hole entropy. The thermodynamic entropy of astrophysical black holes and sub-horizon volumes during big bang nucleosynthesis exceed the relevant bounds unless M ∗> 10 (4 − 6) TeV, so a hierarchy relative to the weak scale is unavoidable. We discuss the implications for extra dimensions as well as holography...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the application of}} scenario planning techniques to the detailed and daunting challenge of city re-positioning when policy makers {{are faced with a}} heavy history and a complex future context. It reviews a process of scenario planning undertaken in the Edinburgh city region, exploring the scenario process and its contribution to strategies and policies for city repositioning. Strongly rooted in the recent literature on urban and regional economic development, the text outlines how key individuals and organisations involved in the process participated in far-reaching analyses of <b>the</b> possible future <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Edinburgh city region might find itself...|$|R

25|$|When Evelyn Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited, portraying {{life in the}} English country house, was {{published}} in 1945, its first few chapters offered a glimpse of an exclusive and enviable world, a world of beautiful country houses with magnificent contents, privileged occupants, a profusion of servants and great wealth. Yet, in its final chapters, Brideshead's author accurately documented a changing and fading world, a <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> country house {{as a symbol of}} power, privilege and a natural order, was not to exist.|$|E

Adventures, monsters and story of the games are usually drawn from legends of the respective mythology on which a title is based, although there are several cross-over exceptions, like the Eastern European Baba Yaga also appearing in the first game, which is distinctly German.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 a Satanic {{group based}} in Toledo, Ohio, part of the United States, came to public attention. Called the Our Lady of Endor Coven, it was led {{by a man named}} Herbert Sloane, who {{described}} his Satanic tradition as the Ophite Cultus Satanas and alleged that it had been established in the 1940s. The group offered a Gnostic interpretation of the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> creator God was regarded as evil and the Biblical Serpent presented as a force for good who had delivered salvation to humanity in the Garden of Eden. Sloane's claims that his group had a 1940s origin remain unproven; it may be that he falsely claimed older origins for his group to make it appear older than Anton LaVey's Church of Satan which had been established in 1966.|$|E

Ged's journey through the series has been compared to the traditional heroic quest, including a [...] "descent into the underworld" [...] represented by the labyrinth in The Tombs of Atuan. It has drawn comparisons to the character of Alvin in Arthur C. Clarke's novella The City and the Stars.|$|E
