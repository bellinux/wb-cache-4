5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Lee traveled throughout Korea to find new subject matters for his art. He found them in nature—seas, beaches, fields and agricultural products—in artificial environments—stone walls in Jeju Island as well as manufactured architectural items—and in unfamiliar areas such as seaweed farms. In 1964, he created an installation work called The <b>Wind</b> <b>Fence</b> in the Han River on Nanji Island. The work was inspired by color rope fences around garlic fields in the countryside. The <b>Wind</b> <b>Fence</b> (1964) is composed of wood sticks and fabric. The wood sticks are firmly embedded to the ground in a circular orientation. The fabrics are tied to every stick and they horizontally connect each wood stick to another, forming four zig-zagged circles. Overall, they form a shape of a fence. Lee considers finding new subject matters significant for inventing new concept and method for his art. In the same year, he did some performance art such as The Burning Canvas Floating on the River (1964). He burned his old paintings and let them drift away in the Han River to demonstrate his defiant drive to [...] "escape from the bonds of the past".|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on truck {{aerodynamic}} analysis under crosswind conditions by means of numerical modeling. The truck was located {{on the crest of}} an embankment during the study. In order to analyze the performance of three <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> models, the truck's aerodynamic coefficients were obtained and compared in two different situations either with or without the wind fences installed. In addition, the effect of both height and porosity of <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> models on the aerodynamic coefficients acting on truck with respect to separation distance between the truck and the <b>wind</b> <b>fence,</b> was analyzed. A finite volume (or computational fluid dynamic) code was used to carry out the numerical modeling. The Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes (RANS) equations along with the k?? SST turbulence model were used to predict the behavior of turbulent flow. With respect to the results, the influence of the distance on the rollover coefficient is soft for all height values studied except for the lowest value (1 m of fence height), where the maximum value of rollover coefficient was obtained for the truck position closer to the fence. Regarding fence porosity, its effect on rollover coefficient is stronger for truck positions on road closer to the <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> model.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{improving}} traffic safety on bridges under crosswind conditions, as adverse wind conditions can {{increase the risk of}} traffic accidents. Two ways to improve traffic safety are investigated: improving vehicle stability by means of wind fences installed on the bridge deck and by modifying the design parameters of the infrastructure. Specifically, this study examines the influence of different parameters related to the bridge deck configuration on the aerodynamic coefficients acting on a bus model under crosswind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients related to side force, lift force and rollover moment are obtained for three classes of bridge deck (box, girder and board) by numerical simulation. FLUENT was used to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier?Stokes (RANS) equations along with the shear stress transport (SST) k?? turbulence model. Two crash barriers located on the box bridge deck were replaced with an articulating <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> model and the effect of the angle between the <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> and the horizontal plane on the bus aerodynamic was investigated. The risk of rollover accidents was found to be slightly influenced by the bridge deck type for a yaw angle range between 75 ° and 120 °. In order to study the effect of the yaw angle on the aerodynamic coefficients acting on bus, both the bus model and the bridge model were simultaneously rotated. The minimum value of the rollover coefficient was obtained for an angle of 60 ° between the <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> slope and the horizontal plane. The only geometry parameter of the box bridge deck which significantly affects bus aerodynamics is the box height. The present research highlights the usefulness of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for improving traffic safety, studying the performance of the articulating <b>wind</b> <b>fence,</b> and determining which geometry parameters of the box deck have a significant influence on the bus stability.

Despite a wealth of studies investigating the impact of vegetation and windbreaks on windflow in controlled wind-tunnel and modelling environments, there is still a paucity of empirical field data for accurately parameterising the effect of vegetation in wind and sediment transport models. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a general parameterisation of wind flow recovery in the lee of typical dryland vegetation elements (grass clumps and shrubs), based on their height (h) and optical porosity (θ). Spatial variations in mean wind velocity around 8 isolated vegetation elements in Namibia (3 grass clumps and 5 shrubs) were recorded at 0. 30 [*]m height, using a combination of sonic and cup anemometry sampled at a temporal frequency of 10 [*]s. Wind flow recovery in the lee of the elements was parameterised in an exponential form, (see article). The best-fit parameters derived from the field data were u 0 [*]=[*]uref(0. 0146 θ - 0. 4076) and u 0 [*]=[*]uref(0. 0146 θ - 0. 4076). By comparing this parameterisation to existing models, it is shown that wind recovery curves derived from two-dimensional <b>wind</b> <b>fence</b> experiments may not be suitable analogues for describing airflow around more complex, three-dimensional forms. Field-derived parameterisations such as the one presented here are a crucial step for connecting plant-scale windflow behaviour to dryland bedform development at landscape scales...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDryland {{vegetation}} {{is often}} spatially patchy, and so affects wind flow in complex ways. Theoretical models and wind tunnel testing {{have shown that}} skimming flow develops above vegetation patches at high plant densities, resulting in little or no wind erosion in these zones. Understanding the dynamics of skimming flow is therefore important for predicting sediment transport and bedform development in dryland areas. However, no field-based data are available describing turbulent airflow dynamics {{in the wake of}} vegetation patches. In this study, turbulent wind flow was examined using high-frequency (10 Hz) sonic anemometry at four measurement heights (0. 30 m, 0. 55 m, 1. 10 m and 1. 65 m) along a transect in the lee of an extensive patch of shrubs (z= 1. 10 m height) in Namibia. Spatial variations in mean wind velocity, horizontal Reynolds stresses and coherent turbulent structures were analysed. We found that wind velocity {{in the wake of the}} patch effectively recovered over ∼ 12 patch heights (h) downwind, which is 2 – 5 h longer than previously reported recovery lengths for individual vegetation elements and two-dimensional <b>wind</b> <b>fences.</b> This longer recovery can be attributed to a lack of flow moving around the obstacle in the patch case. The step-change in roughness between the patch canopy and the bare surface in its wake resulted in an initial peak in resultant horizontal shear stress (τr) followed by significant decrease downwind. In contrast to τr, horizontal normal Reynolds stress (u′ 2 ‾) progressively increased along the patch wake. A separation of the upper shear layer at the leeside edge of the patch was observed, and a convergence of τr curves implies the formation of a constant stress layer by ∼ 20 h downwind. The use of τr at multiple heights is found to be a useful tool for identifying flow equilibration in complex aerodynamic regimes. Quadrant analysis revealed elevated frequencies of Q 2 (ejection) and Q 4 (sweep) events in the immediate lee of the patch, which contributed to the observed high levels of shear stress. The increasing downwind contribution of Q 1 (outward interaction) events, which coincides with greater u′ 2 ‾ and wind velocity, suggests that sediment transport potential increases with greater distance from the patch edge. Determining realistic, field-derived constraints on turbulent airflow dynamics in the wakes of vegetation patches is crucial for accurately parameterising sediment transport potential in larger-scale dryland landscape models. This will help to improve our understanding of how semi-vegetated desert surfaces might react to future environmental and anthropogenic stresses...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on the crosswind field on the circulation of railway vehicles became noteworthy in the 90 s {{with the development of}} high-speed trains. The European project TRANSAERO (Schulte-Werning et al., 2002) was the starting point since it was able {{to attract the attention of}} both the scientific community and the rolling stock manufacturers. Crosswinds are a safety matter and one of the key factors that are able to stop the continuous speed increase requested to the rail transportation. The study of the effect of crosswinds on vehicles problem requires a global vision since it involves both the dynamics and the aerodynamics of the vehicle. It is a coupled problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach and therefore the thesis addresses the problem from both perspectives. The sections centered on the vehicle dynamics firstly study 2 D models and their benefit to extract conclusions in regard to the vehicle safety and comfort. The wheel unloading ratio is the factor used by standards to guarantee the safeness of the vehicle in the crosswind context. Conclusions show that a simplified model is able to provide wheel unloading factors with small rates of error. Moreover, crosswinds can also become a problem from the point of view of the vehicle’s comfort. By using full multibody models, we checked that the case of circulation on a curved track under lateral wind sets especially adverse conditions that can constraint the vehicle to reduce the travel speed in cases of high wind speeds. We observed that the vehicle described a yawing movement that made it to become instable, which reduced significantly the ride quality. The thesis describes previous aerodynamic {{research on}} the three-dimensional flow around high-speed trains in a crosswind scenario. However, the effect of the infrastructure is important and any modification at the surroundings of the vehicle alters the flow. At this respect, the thesis studies the sheltering effect of <b>wind</b> <b>fences.</b> Firstly, 2 D computations have been used to carry out a parametric study of the fence design and to validate the value of simplified models. This work shows that 2 D models are valid to find a set of fence designs to carry more detailed simulations in the 3 D space. The goal of measuring the sheltering effect of wind-breaking devices in the 3 D space was to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients of the vehicle using some of the fence designs that were used in the 2 D model. The proposal herein presented is based on the use of a meshless CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that is based on the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). Results prove that these codes provide results with a reasonable margin of error at the range of yaw angles of interest for this investigation...|$|R

The Unicameral also repealed the water checkoff on corn and sorghum, and opened up the integrated management plan process to all NRDs. LB 862 may help NRDs get closer to where they need to be in the Republican Basin. Will this fix everything in the Republican Basin? Bill LB 862 is a big step in the right direction. The $ 10 /acre tax will likely be challenged in court, so that may cause a delay. But aside from that, Republican Basin NRDs should {{be able to use the}} taxes to issue bonds to purchase or lease surface and ground water rights, to the extent needed to keep Nebraska in compliance with the Republican Compact Settlement Agreement...|$|R
