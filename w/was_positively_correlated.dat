The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E

The study explored leadership style as a predictor in students' ratings of overall teaching effectiveness, learning, breadth, examinations, and assignments. A Pearson product-moment correlation was conducted to examine the inter-correlations between the leadership styles, the inter-correlations between the four SEEQ factors of Learning, Breadth, Examinations, and Assignments, {{and the relationship between}} the four SEEQ factors and the leadership styles. Transformational leadership was highly correlated with transactional leadership and passive avoidant leadership style was negatively correlated with transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The inter-correlation of the SEEQ factors showed that the four factors were highly correlated. Learning and transformational leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Breadth and transformational leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Examinations and transformational leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Assignments and transformational leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Breadth and transactional leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Examinations and transactional leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Assignments and transactional leadership <b>were</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated.</b> Passive Avoidant leadership negatively correlated with all four dimensions of the SEEQ. Multiple regression indicated that transformational leadership was a predictor all 4 dimensions – Learning, Breadth, Examinations, and Assignments. Transactional leadership was a predictor for Breadth and Examinations. Student age was a predictor for three dimensions of the SEEQ – Learning, Examinations, and Assignments...|$|R

If X <b>is</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Y and Y <b>is</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Z, it {{does not}} {{necessarily}} follow that X <b>is</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Z. In this article we nd ranges for the correlation coecients rXY and rY Z that guarantee that X and Z have a specied level of correlation. We explore the implications of these results to nding relationships between variables investigated in dierent studies. 1. Introduction. Suppose X, Y, and Z are random variables with X <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Y, and Y <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Z. It is very tempting to conclude that X <b>is</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> to Z. In fact, this conclusion is not always valid; it is possible for the correlation coecients rXY and rY Z to be positive but for X and Z to be totally uncorrelate...|$|R

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and vitamin B2 concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E

25|$|Within the Big Five {{model of}} personality, need for {{cognition}} {{has been found}} to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. Need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. Need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it <b>was</b> <b>positively</b> <b>correlated</b> with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. Need for cognition has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. It is also negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although {{it is also possible that}} higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. Need for cognition may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. Regarding absorption, people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation.|$|E
