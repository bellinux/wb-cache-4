500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
2500|$|Reitman had Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin in {{mind for}} the lead roles. In June 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Winslet and Brolin had joined the cast of the film. On casting the actors, he said, [...] "I know what actors I want for it. I'll {{be able to go to}} them easily" [...] and that [...] " [...] makes those characters beautiful and sexual. I don’t know another actor who does that. I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if she’d said no." ...|$|E

2500|$|Corine Barande-Barbe, trainer of Cirrus des Aigles, magnanimously {{said after}} the race: [...] "It was a great day {{and it was like}} a victory to make Frankel gallop." [...] Teddy Grimthorpe commented: [...] "The way {{everyone}} has reacted to Frankel and Henry {{has been one of the}} great sporting stories of the year if not for many years. It was just brilliant and totally deserved." [...] Tom Queally said: [...] "You never see an F1 car win on anything but tarmac but for him to win on ground like that shows how special he is. There was a bigger crowd at Royal Ascot but this was more intense. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if he didn't win." [...] Sir Henry Cecil commented: [...] "He's the best I've ever had, the best I've ever seen. I'd be very surprised if there's ever been a better." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{when asked}} about the {{possibility}} of someone else making Star Wars films, Lucas said, [...] "Probably not, it's my thing." [...] In a 2008 interview in Total Film, Lucas ruled out anybody else making Star Wars films. Asked if he was happy for new Star Wars films to be made after his death, he said: [...] "I've left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features. There will definitely be no Episodes VII–IX. That's because there isn't any story. I mean, I never thought of anything. And now there have been novels about the events after Episode VI, which isn't at all <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with it. The Star Wars story is really the tragedy of Darth Vader. That is the story. Once Vader dies, he doesn't come back to life, the Emperor doesn't get cloned and Luke doesn't get married..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a turn of events, a {{settlement}} was reached between Infinity and the FCC that dismissed all outstanding indecency cases on September 1, 1995. Infinity {{agreed to make}} two payments totaling $1.715 million to the United States Treasury as a [...] "voluntary contribution" [...] while its five indecency NALs were cleared from the FCC's record. An additional $9,000 was given to settle all pending complaints. Though Infinity admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement, Stern accused the FCC of extortion, and called the payout [...] "the biggest shakedown in history... the bullies have won. I lost. That means we all lost." [...] Stern, however, praised his employer. [...] "They fought {{as long as they}} could. Honestly, I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in their shoes... they got jerked around plenty." [...] With its clean record with the FCC, Infinity announced on September 22, 1995 the purchase of seven radio stations owned by Alliance Broadcasting for $275 million that expanded its number of outlets to 34. The Howard Stern Show was syndicated to 26 stations across the country by December 1995.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong. The column was the all-consuming Moloch, when it had been put to bed, there was nothing left of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is {{a highly}} {{encouraging}} circumstance in Edward's illness, I am thankful to think, and gives one the greatest confidence in his sense not being impaired, or his proper spirit weakened--down {{to the time of}} poor dear papa's death at all events--that he paid off Mrs General instantly, and sent her out of the house.

[...] She intimated that if Kenton did not act with more {{self-restraint}} she should do little less than take Ellen ashore, and abandon him to the voyage alone. Under the intimidation he promised not to speak of Ellen again.|$|E
6000|$|... "It has pleased neither Heaven nor you, Tisbina," [...] exclaimed {{the unhappy}} young man, [...] "to put my best {{feelings}} to the proof. Often have two lovers perished for love; {{the world will}} now behold a sacrifice of three. Oh, why did you not make a request to me in your turn, and ask me to free you from your promise?

Never did I think of giving you displeasure; and I now do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> at any time to prevent it, I absolve you from your oath.

We are alternately on the watch (quite unsuspected, I am certain, by the people opposite) day and night. All my feelings, as a gentleman and a clergyman, revolt from such an occupation as I am now engaged in; {{but there is no}} other choice. I must either do this violence to my own self-respect, or I must leave Allan, with his easy nature, and in his assailable position, to defend himself against a wretch who is prepared, I firmly believe, to take the most unscrupulous advantage of his weakness and his youth. His mother's dying entreaty has never left my memory; and, God help me, I am now degrading myself in my own eyes in consequence.|$|E
