500|$|According to the {{producers}} of House, Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House. The writers chose to start off Stacy's story arc [...] "very subtly", but to end it with a [...] "big blowout". Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part {{because it was the}} first person the writing staff of House came up with, adding that she acts in a [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "convincing way". Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>kids,</b> which is why she had also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives. However, she changed her mind when she saw tapes of the show, because as she watched she realized that House [...] "would be fun to be a part of".|$|E

60|$|Now Chiron {{delineated}} σχηματα ολυμπου the Asterisms, as {{the ancient}} Author of Gigantomachia, cited by [72] Clemens Alexandrinus informs us: for Chiron was a practical Astronomer, {{as may be}} there understood also of his daughter Hippo: and Musæus, the son of Eumolpus and master of Orpheus, {{and one of the}} Argonauts, [73] made a Sphere, and is reputed the first among the Greeks who made one: and the Sphere it self shews that it was delineated in the time of the Argonautic expedition; for that expedition is delineated in the Asterisms, together with several other ancienter Histories of the Greeks, and without any thing later. There's the golden RAM, the ensign of the Vessel in which Phryxus fled to Colchis; the BULL with brazen hoofs tamed by Jason; and the TWINS, CASTOR and POLLUX, two of the Argonauts, with the SWAN of Leda their mother. There's the Ship ARGO, and HYDRUS the watchful Dragon; with Medea's CUP, and a RAVEN upon its Carcass, the Symbol of Death. There's CHIRON the master of Jason, with his ALTAR and SACRIFICE. There's the Argonaut HERCULES with his DART and VULTURE falling down; and the DRAGON, CRAB and LION, whom he slew; and the HARP of the Argonaut Orpheus. All these relate to the Argonauts. There's ORION the son of Neptune, or as some say, the grandson of Minos, with his DOGS, and HARE, and RIVER, and SCORPION. There's the story of Perseus in the Constellations of PERSEUS, ANDROMEDA, CEPHEUS, CASSIOPEA and CETUS: That of Callisto, and her son Arcas, in URSA MAJOR and ARCTOPHYLAX: That of Icareus and his daughter Erigone in BOOTES, PLAUSTRUM and VIRGO. URSA MINOR relates to one of the Nurses of Jupiter, AURIGA to Erechthonius, OPHIUCHUS to Phorbas, SAGITTARIUS to Crolus the son of the Nurse of the Muses, CAPRICORN to Pan, and AQUARIUS to Ganimede. There's Ariadne's CROWN, Bellerophon's HORSE, Neptune's DOLPHIN, Ganimede's EAGLE, Jupiter's GOAT <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>KIDS,</b> Bacchus's ASSES, and the FISHES of Venus and Cupid, and their Parent the SOUTH FISH. These with DELTOTON, are the old Constellations mentioned by Aratus: and they all relate to the Argonauts and their Contemporaries, and to Persons one or two Generations older: and nothing later than that Expedition was delineated there Originally. ANTINOUS and COMA BERENICES are novel. The Sphere seems therefore to have been formed by Chiron and Musæus, {{for the use of the}} Argonauts: for the Ship Argo was the first long ship built by the Greeks. Hitherto they had used round vessels of burden, and kept within sight of the shore; and now, upon an Embassy to several Princes upon the coasts of the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas, [74] by the dictates of the Oracle, and consent of the Princes of Greece, the Flower of Greece were to sail with Expedition through the deep, in a long Ship with Sails, and guide their Ship by the Stars. The People of the Island Corcyra [75] attributed the invention of the Sphere to Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, King of the Pheaces in that Island: and it's most probable that she had it from the Argonauts, who [76] in their return home sailed to that Island, and made some stay there with her father. So then in the time of the Argonautic Expedition, the Cardinal points of the Equinoxes and Solstices were in the middles of the Constellations of Aries, Cancer, Chelæ, and Capricorn.|$|E

40|$|A first {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to verify whether a goat may label <b>her</b> <b>kid</b> through licking and nursing in order to discriminate between her own and two alien kids. Furthermore, it was assessed how long after birth a kid needs to be along with its mother {{in order to be}} rejected by another goat and to be recognized by its own dam. All the 18 goats tested at 2 h accepted their own kid, whereas ten of them rejected both aliens; all the 20 goats tested at 4 h accepted their own young, whereas 17 rejected the alien isolated kid and 18 refused the alien labelled kid. In a second experiment physical contact, licking and nursing were prevented. All the 25 maternal goats accepted their own kids, whereas 11 of them rejected the alien. These two studies indicate that when the goat is left undisturbed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>kid</b> after kidding, maternal selectivity is developed within 4 h...|$|R
