5|$|Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872– 8 June 1913) was a suffragette {{who fought}} for votes {{for women in the}} United Kingdom in the early twentieth century. A member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on hunger strike seven times and was force fed on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by King George V's horse Anmer at the 1913 Epsom Derby when she <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the track during the race.|$|E
5|$|On December 30, 2014 newly hired Michigan Wolverines head {{football}} coach Jim Harbaugh {{was introduced to the}} public during a brief halftime ceremony with the song playing as he <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> center court.

5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began in}} similar fashion to the earlier contest; the Non-Smokers won the toss, and their captain Arthur Shrewsbury chose to bat first. The Smokers, led by the Australian Harry Boyle, <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the pitch smoking cigars. Despite the strong bowling attack boasted by the Smokers, which {{included}} Johnny Briggs and George Lohmann, the Non-Smokers took advantage of a good batting wicket and accrued 196 runs before the first wicket fell, that of William Bruce for 131. Billy Bates was dismissed shortly thereafter for four, bringing in Billy Gunn. Shrewsbury and Gunn batted together {{for the rest of}} the day, and the following morning, building a partnership of 310 runs; Shrewsbury was eventually caught off the bowling of Briggs for 236, while Gunn was bowled by Boyle for 150. Fifties from Richard Houston, Harry Musgrove and Jack Worrall in the middle-order boosted the score to 803, a new record for the highest innings total in first-class cricket. The previous record, 775 runs, had also been set in Australia, by New South Wales. The score fell some way short of the highest innings score in any cricket, which was believed to have been the 920 scored by Orleans Club against Rickling Green in 1882. The score has since been surpassed over twenty times.|$|E

He also made frequent appearances on The Dean Martin Show and became a fixture on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast specials.|$|E
25|$|For all this, Roose's {{popularity}} as a goalkeeper {{was based}} only {{in part on}} his abilities; he {{was also one of}} the great crowd-pleasers of the Edwardian period. Supporters recall him putting on gymnastic displays from his crossbar when play was safely at the other end of the pitch. At a time when other goalkeepers <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the pitch at the beginning of a game, Roose was also unusual in running on briskly, acknowledging the applause of the crowd. When a penalty was awarded, he frequently waved to spectators both before and after completing a save.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday, July 23, 1989, much of America {{learned of}} the AFL for an {{unintended}} reason, when the Pittsburgh Gladiators' head coach, Joe Haering, made football history by punching commissioner Jim Foster during a game with the Chicago Bruisers. The national media ran with the story, including a photo in USA Today. The game was played between the two teams in Sacramento's Arco Arena, {{as part of the}} AFL's 'Barnstorming America' tour. Foster had <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the field of play to mediate an altercation between the two teams when Haering, a former NFL assistant, punched him in the jaw. Haering was suspended without pay.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Galán's staff {{received}} {{information from}} the Colombian intelligence services advising him of the presence in Bogotá {{of a group of}} hitmen with the intention to kill him. His staff advised him not to travel to the town of Soacha and that the trip to Valledupar was more suitable since he was also scheduled to attend a football match in nearby Barranquilla for a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification match in which the Colombian team was going to play. At the last moment, Galán changed his mind and ordered his staff to prepare to go to Soacha. Galán was killed as he <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the stage to give a speech in front of 10,000 people in Soacha. At least ten others were wounded in the gunfire.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Police Force {{previously}} had an Anti-Corruption Branch, {{but it did}} little to reduce corruption. Public perception was that Anti-Corruption police, following the discovery of corrupt practices, would then enter into the dealings themselves. One example was Peter Godber, a senior officer stationed at Wanchai police station and later at Kai Tak Airport police station. Before his retirement in 1973, he had amassed at least 4.3million Hong Kong dollars (approximately 600,000 US dollars) in overseas bank accounts. The police's Anti-Corruption Branch investigated his wealth and ordered him to explain his source of income. In response, Godber immediately arranged for his wife to leave the colony, then used his police airport pass to bypass Immigration and Passport checks and <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> a plane for London. Godber's escape led to a large public outcry over the integrity {{and quality of the}} police's self-investigation and called for reforms in the government's anti-corruption efforts. Godber was later extradited back to Hong Kong to face trial and was convicted.|$|E

500|$|During the 1950s, Szigeti {{began to}} develop {{arthritis}} {{in his hands and}} his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria!

500|$|On Christmas Day, Brigadier-General Walter Congreve, then {{commanding}} 18 Infantry Brigade, stationed near Neuve Chapelle, wrote {{a letter}} recalling the Germans initiated by calling a truce for the day.

[...] Officers and men shook hands and exchanged cigarettes and cigars, one of his captains [...] "smoked a cigar with the best shot in the German army", the latter no more than 18 years old. [...] Congreve admitted {{he was reluctant to}} personally witness the scene of the truce for fear he would be a prime target for German snipers.|$|E
500|$|The {{tradition}} of having goats {{in the military}} originated in 1775, when a wild goat <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the battlefield in Boston during the American Revolutionary War and led the Welsh regimental colours {{at the end of}} the Battle of Bunker Hill. Another Welsh military goat, TaffyIV, served in the First World War. Taffy, of 2nd Battalion, Welsh Regiment, is officially recorded as [...] "The Regimental Goat". He embarked for the war on 13 August 1914 and saw action in the Retreat from Mons, the First Battle of Ypres (including the Battle of Gheluvelt) and the Battles of Festubert and Givenchy, before dying on 20 January 1915. He was posthumously awarded the 1914 Star, British War Medal and the Victory Medal.|$|E

The male pop singer reasoned that the liplock, which was dubbed [...] "The Kiss of the Century", would be talked about for decades, with people playing the clip over and over. Jackson's attempts at placating his wife proved futile; she told the singer not to [...] "fucking even come near me" [...] and remained angry for several days.|$|E

The Nixons <b>walked</b> <b>onto</b> the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford. The outgoing president would depart from the White House on Marine One. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, [...] "You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em."
