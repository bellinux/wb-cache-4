5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots {{who seek to}} kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek {{to make it through}} high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

25|$|The TV 21 strips {{portray the}} {{opposing}} sides in Skaro's war as the Thals and the Daleks, shown as diminutive blue men with large heads somewhat similar in appearance to Dan Dare's Mekon. The Thals are a peaceful race <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> continent of Davius. Across the Ocean of Ooze, the Daleks inhabit Dalazar. According to the comic, these humanoid Daleks build neutron bombs which are accidentally detonated by a meteorite storm. (The {{idea of the}} war having an accidental, rather than deliberate origin, goes back to an earlier draft of the first Dalek television story.) The Daleks' chief scientist, Yarvelling, had built Dalek casings as war machines prior to the nuclear holocaust. After the neutron bombs explode, Yarvelling and Zolfian, the warlord of the humanoid Daleks, explore their continent and contract radiation sickness. They discover that a mutated Dalek had survived in the war machine casing. This Dalek persuades Yarvelling and Zolfian to build more Dalek casings for their mutated descendants. Before the last two humanoid Daleks die, it declares itself the Dalek Emperor, and has a new casing built to reflect its new rank, slightly shorter than the other Daleks, with a disproportionately large spheroid head section and in gold rather than grey.|$|E
500|$|The Mamluks {{contributed to}} Gazan {{architecture}} by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths. They also allowed Jews {{to return to}} the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller Meshulam of Volterra wrote:Gazza is called by the Moslems Gaza. It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses. They had already begun to make the new wine. ... The Jews live {{at the top of the}} hill. May God exalt them. There are also four Samaritan householders <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillside.|$|E

500|$|Production {{moved to}} Longcross Studios in the UK on November 11, and was {{scheduled}} to stay there until March 2016. The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as [...] "very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it’s steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with {{the shape of the}} streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge." [...] For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> real Kathmandu street. The inside of Kamar-Taj was also constructed at Longcross, with [...] "sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary." [...] Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a [...] "truly spiritual, truly magical" [...] feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street [...] "complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Sun Trail, prey {{is scarce}} in the {{mountain}} home of the Tribe of Pointed Stones, so a cat named Gray Wing and his companions must leave to find more food and a better home. Once they reach their new forest home Gray Wing {{falls in love with}} a rogue cat there named Storm. The Tribe cats start to live in the forest and take in rogue cats.

Gray Wing discovers that Storm is pregnant by Clear Sky and that she is going to live with him, breaking Gray Wing's heart. When Turtle Tail, another one of the Tribe cats, who becomes a kittypet later in The Sun Trail tells Gray Wing that Storm is in trouble, Gray Wing does not believe her. When he finds Storm, she is dead along with two of her three kits.
