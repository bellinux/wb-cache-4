On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, {{at some point during the}} war, he received an injury to his knee.

The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

Louis Armstrong was, in fact, baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans, and he met popes Pius XII and Paul VI, though there is no {{evidence}} that he considered himself Catholic. Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.|$|E

25|$|In Paris, Morphy {{suffered}} from a bout of intestinal influenza. In accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing {{a significant amount of}} blood. Although too weak to stand up unaided, Morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting German master Adolf Anderssen, {{considered by many to be}} Europe's leading player. Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> defeat, Anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion La Bourdonnais.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> weight gain, Boyd claimed {{that he had been}} eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E
25|$|Belaney enlisted {{with the}} Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force (CEF) on May 6, 1915 during the First World War. His Regimental number with the CEF was 415259. On his {{attestation}} papers, {{he claimed to}} be born in Montreal on September 18, 1888, and listed no next of kin. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> marital status, it appears some confusion may have occurred; the word 'yes' was written and then crossed out, then the word 'no' was written and crossed out, leaving his marital status unclear to the military {{at the time of}} enlistment. He stated his trade was a 'trapper' and that he previously served as a 'Mexican Scout' with the 28th Dragoons, although this is unclear since the U.S. was not in any significant military actions in the region (other than small operations, in which he could not have served; {{he would have had to}} serve between 1904 and 1915). Belaney joined the 13th (Montreal) Battalion of the Black Watch. His unit was shipped to France, where he served as a sniper. His comrades accepted his self-presentation as Indian and generally praised his conduct. Belaney was wounded in January 1916, and then more seriously on April 24, 1916, with a shot through the foot. When the wounded limb developed gangrene, Belaney was shipped to Britain for treatment.|$|E

25|$|On August 27, 2009, Gillispie {{was arrested}} at 2:45am in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky for driving under the influence. A {{passenger}} in the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300, Charles O'Connor, {{was arrested and charged}} with alcohol intoxication. According to the police report, an officer saw the vehicle swerving and stopped the driver. The officers who were at the scene smelled a strong odor of alcohol, describing Gillispie's eyes as being red and glassy, with his speech slurred. <b>When</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> proof of insurance, Gillispie stated that it was in a golf bag in his trunk. He then refused a blood test and a breathalyzer on the scene and was subsequently arrested and taken to the Franklin County jail. Gillispie pleaded not guilty. A judge had scheduled a trial for February 10, 2010 in the case. However, on November 2, 2009, Gillispie changed his plea to guilty under a plea agreement. He was fined $1,028 and must complete an alcohol and drug education course before his Kentucky driver's license can be renewed. He has had two prior DUI arrests, the first in 1999 when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and improper use of a lane in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. He was arrested again in 2003 in his first year at the University of Texas at El Paso on suspicion of drunken driving, although it was later dismissed based on a lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|For the 1997–98 season, the {{retirement}} of Eric Cantona saw Cole emerge as first choice striker once again, and he discovered his best form ever for the club. He became the joint top goalscorer in the Premier League {{during the course of}} the season with 18 goals, including a slew of spectacular goals, one of which (a chip against Everton) had the fans' vote as the Manchester United goal of the season. Cole also developed a strong partnership with Teddy Sheringham (despite considerable personal friction between the two), but United finished trophyless for only the second time in nine seasons as they lost to Arsenal in the end. Cole achieved several personal landmarks in this campaign, scoring his first European hat-trick for the club in an away match at Feyenoord, as well as ending the season as runner-up in the PFA Players' Player of the Year award to Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp. Despite this accreditation, and being the leading goalscorer in all competitions that season with 25, Cole was omitted from England's 1998 FIFA World Cup squad by then-manager Glenn Hoddle. Cole remained upbeat when interviewed and <b>when</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> new-found return to success, he claimed he had found freedom in his life after the injuries of the previous season, saying he had great joy with his newborn son and lived for him and his family in his faith as a Born again Christian. He also claimed the friendship of Ryan Giggs, his roommate on away matches, was a major motivating factor through the tough times when fans doubted him at United.|$|E
