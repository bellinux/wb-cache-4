5|$|According to Russian sources, the {{official}} decision to launch Sputnik 2 {{was made on}} 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik 2, therefore, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a rush job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E

5|$|Being like Lofty <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I {{aspired to}} without {{realising}} it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E

This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E

5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic <b>was</b> <b>something</b> the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit.

Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God <b>was</b> <b>something</b> to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|The Ottawa-based council {{eventually}} grew {{sensitive to}} the needs of the territory residents. Democracy returned to the territories in the sixth general election in 1951. After the election, the council <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a vagabond body, with alternating sittings in Ottawa, and various communities in Northwest Territories. The council held meetings in school gymnasiums, community halls, board rooms, or any suitable infrastructure. The council even transported ceremonial implements to conduct meetings with such as the speakers chair and mace. Both are traditional artifacts common to Westminster style parliaments.|$|E

5|$|The album <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a stopgap for the band, who {{had already}} started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was {{recorded}} in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event pitted Raven against P.J. Polaco. This match {{occurred}} because Raven refused to quit the company, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko had requested in the storyline. Since Raven refused to quit, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle Polaco. Cassidy Riley interfered in the match by attempting to aid Raven. The duration of the bout was 5 minutes and 45 seconds. Raven won the contest by forcing Polaco's head into the mat with his signature Even Flow DDT maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough {{to give him a}} second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that {{everyone}} around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Kamo, {{none of the}} {{organizers}} of the robbery were ever brought to trial, and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid, but after the arrest of Kamo, Litvinov and others, the Bolshevik involvement became obvious. The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress. The leader of the Mensheviks, Georgi Plekhanov, called for separation from the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov's colleague, Julius Martov, said the Bolshevik Centre <b>was</b> <b>something</b> between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang. The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery. The party's investigations into Lenin's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
