5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky and they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look like tight skin {{wrapped around a}} very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E

Having endured enough of the local hookers and transvestites, they moved out and Castillo began living in his pick-up truck. On the recommendation of another former Albuquerque musician, singer/songwriter Michael Goodroe, he joined pop band The Motels, whom Goodroe played bass for, when their drummer fell sick with a heart condition {{just as they were}} about to go on tour. Castillo embarked on his first major arena tour with The Motels in support of The Cars.|$|E

Out of our four records, I thought {{this might be}} the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day." [...] Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, [...] "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, but we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more fun".|$|E
500|$|The test footage {{was leaked}} online in July 2014, and {{was met with}} an {{overwhelmingly}} enthusiastic response. That September, Fox officially gave Deadpool a release date of February 12, 2016. Production was set to begin in March 2015, and Simon Kinberg joining as producer. Reynolds [...] "100 percent" [...] attributed Fox's greenlighting of the film to the leak. He, Miller, and the writers had discussed leaking the footage themselves before, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had leaked the footage. He later believed that the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange {{for being able to}} make the film how they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a test case in court." ...|$|E

For Olivia's spinal tap scene, Toye attempted to create a [...] "creepy and weird" [...] atmosphere. He explained, [...] "She's strapped down, she's in a gurney. They're going to pull fluid out of her spine. It's creepy and weird. That's what we're going for, to try and set it up as a really awkward, horrible environment to be trapped in." [...] Toye and the crew <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> [...] "as visually interesting and dramatic as possible," [...] and added in dripping water and [...] "creepy" [...] lighting to emphasize Olivia's [...] "terrible circumstances." [...] First assistant director Gary Rake noted that the episode [...] "took the character Olivia to a higher level... She's a lot more active, which is very exciting for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Paramount made a {{decision}} early on to use existing ship models for filming, meaning the old models—some {{more than a decade}} old—had to be refurbished, adapted, and reused. As some ships had not been examined for some time, electrical problems had developed. The Klingon cruiser first seen in 1979's The Motion Picture was altered to suggest an important flagship, with a flared design applied to the underside of the vessel. Effects supervisor William George <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> distinct from the earlier ships, since {{it was one of the}} few models that could be altered: [...] "We did some research into military costuming, and came up with the concept that when these ships return victorious from battle, the Klingons build some sort of epaulet onto their wings or paint a new stripe on." [...] The model was repainted brown and red and etched with brass.|$|E

He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do you come out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} noted {{there were}} a history of [...] "sexy, pneumatic, hydraulic women" [...] in science fiction, and wanted to [...] "tap into that." [...] To make the cyberwoman costume, the props department <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "sexy" [...] as they can. Director James Strong {{wanted to make the}} costume look [...] "amazing," [...] but threatening and scary as well. There were discussions about which parts of Lisa would be human, and which parts would be cyborg. Made out of rubber, it was custom made to fit Chikezie as much as possible. It took an entire day for the actress to get her body cast. After the costume was completed, it would take an hour to apply each morning, and an hour to remove by lunch break. Chikezie found it difficult to hear anything from the helmet while shooting scenes. It was also uncomfortable for her, but the producers noted she remained stoic throughout filming.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello.

They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E

In an interview with Q magazine, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band could not {{make up their minds}} about the track listing, as they had discussed that they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks and an intended length of under 42 minutes. Champion further stated, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> almost impossible for you to not listen to it all in one go." [...] In addition, vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the band had wanted to have a [...] "two-in-one" [...] song title, as American recording artist Justin Timberlake had done the same on his album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).|$|E
