The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys {{within the range}} of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society’s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.|$|E

The 2,000 successful ancestors that arrived at Kohala evolved into about 8,500 to 12,500 unique species, resulting in a very high ratio of the species present being found nowhere else on Earth. Only about 2.5% of the world's rainforest is cloud rainforest, making it a unique habitat as well.|$|E

In response to what was deemed a [...] "crisis in public relations", Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall assembled the Special Advisory Board on Wildlife Management in 1962 to conduct thorough studies to be conducted on its science and resource management. The purpose of the board was to collect scientific data and investigate the necessity of <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> control. Chairing the board was A. Starker Leopold, the eldest son of noted conservationist Aldo Leopold. A respected zoologist, professor of ecology, and Assistant to the Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, Leopold was joined on the board by other prominent scientists and conservationists: Professor Stanley A.

Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.|$|E

40|$|As long linear {{features}} on the landscape, railways, roads and highways have impacts on wildlife and wildlife habitat that are disproportionate {{to the area of}} land that they occupy. In addition to impacts on habitat, highways and railways are sources of road mortality that threaten <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations.</b> Indirect effects on wildlife include reduced access to habitat due to road avoidance and human exploitation. Transportation infrastructure also undermines ecological processes through the fragmentation of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> restriction of <b>wildlife</b> movements, and the disruption of gene flow and metapopulation dynamics. A variety of techniques have been used to mitigate the impacts of transportation systems on wildlife movements with mixed success. To make progress on these issues wildlife biologists must: 1) recognize the potential long-term effects of highways and railways on <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> and advocate more strongly for appropriate mitigation measures, 2) document the impacts of transportation infrastructure on <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> 3) conduct landscape analyses to identify “connectivity zones” and use these analyses to engage transportation planners earlier in the planning process, 4) enlist transportation engineers to help solve technical problems, and 5) design and conduct good monitoring studies to effectively evaluate various mitigation techniques...|$|R
