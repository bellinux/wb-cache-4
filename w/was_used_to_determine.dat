5|$|Use of the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph (FIES) at the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands on June 4, 2009 {{provided}} {{data that}} <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the star's stellar classification. The W.M. Keck Observatory's High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), {{which was used}} on June 3–6, 2009, and July 2–4, 2009, determined radial velocity measurements for the star, which helped to further define stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine}} the mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E

5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} {{accumulated}} through free throws or field goals. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) scoring title is {{awarded to the}} player with the highest points per game average in a given season. The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the leader instead. Players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any two point field goals because the three-point line was first implemented in the NBA during that season. To qualify for the scoring title, the player must appear in at least 70games (out of 82) or have at least 1,400points. These have been the entry criteria since the 1974–75 season.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, {{as well as other}} receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E

5|$|The thirty-five Tribes {{were not}} ethnic or kinship groups, {{but rather a}} generic {{division}} into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost. The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which Tribe should vote next. The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that {{the order of the}} lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods. Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{competitions}} around the world, the Copa Libertadores historically {{did not use}} extra time, or away goals. From 1960 to 1987, two-legged ties were decided on points (teams would be awarded 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss), without taking goal difference into consideration. If both teams were level on points after two legs, a third match would be played at a neutral venue. Goal difference would only come into play if the third match was drawn. If the third match did not produce an immediate winner, a penalty shootout <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> a winner.|$|E

5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, {{but when it was}} ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.|$|E
