Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary for any one of us to persuade anybody else; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> of a mind that there really wasn't any choice." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 June 2017 reggae group Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30, with BBC Four {{scheduled}} to show highlights from their set. When {{they did not}} show it was suspected they missed their time slot, and BBC broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologized on their behalf stating, [...] "If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> – {{it seems like they}} were on Jamaican time or something because they didn't make it to the site on time." [...] The group credited with coining the term [...] "reggae" [...] in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the book}} Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays, [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] has an [...] "unusually somber tone" [...] for an {{animated}} Disney film. Performed [...] "as a prayer for deliverance from [...] pain and suffering," [...] lyrically, [...] "God Help the Outcasts," [...] a song about faith, explores themes such as discrimination. Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds." [...] Midler's shorter rendition, considered a reprise of Mollenhauer's original, features modified lyrics, replacing [...] "to a gypsy's prayer" [...] with [...] "to a humble prayer." ...|$|E

He {{and his younger}} brother Rafi would often sing together, notably songs composed by Haim Hefer. During the Six-Day War, the street adjacent to his home was hit by Arab artillery. Levy describes his political views as a teenager as typically mainstream.

2500|$|R.L. Shaffer of IGN {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 8 out of 10, taking [...] "a moment to thank The Hunger Games for {{reminding}} us how awesome Battle Royale really is" [...] and concluding that Battle Royale is [...] "a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama." [...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many [...] "reviews of Battle Royale focus on the violence, which is extreme to be sure, {{and not so much}} on the humanity of the film." [...] He stated that [...] "cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective" [...] and that [...] "the story of Battle Royale is the story of those teenage years and just how wrong <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> about the extent of our emotional turmoil." [...] DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 for the Director's Cut, concluding that it gives [...] "a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it's everyone for themselves. There's enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close) – but most importantly it makes you think." [...] Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as [...] "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" [...] and [...] "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece." [...] Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as [...] "savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny" [...] and [...] "a bleak commentary on humanity and society." ...|$|E
