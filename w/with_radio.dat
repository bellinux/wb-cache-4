5|$|An {{example of}} notable shortwave {{programming}} was the Happy Station Show, popularly called the “world’s longest-running shortwave radio program”. The show originated on Philips Radio's PCJJ shortwave station in 1928, continuing until 1940. After World War II Radio Netherlands broadcast the show from 1946 until it terminated in 1995. Producer and presenter Keith Perron “resurrected” Happy Station on March 12, 2009. Although no longer associated <b>with</b> <b>Radio</b> Netherlands, the new effort proclaims itself as “transmitted globally via shortwave, podcasting and Internet streaming radio”.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped <b>with</b> <b>radio</b> set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938.

5|$|Frank {{was posted}} to the 1. Ergänzungsstaffel (1st Supplemental Training Squadron) of Nachtjagdgeschwader 3 (NJG 3—3rd Night Fighter Wing) on 5 February 1941. The unit was {{stationed}} at Stuttgart-Echterdingen (now Stuttgart Airport). Initially he flew <b>with</b> <b>radio</b> operator (Bordfunker) Gefreiter (Private) Willimowski before Hans-Georg Schierholz was assigned as his permanent radio operator. Frank and Schierholz had already formed a crew at the Nachtjagdschule 1 at Schleißheim. The two were then assigned to 1. Staffel (1st Squadron) of NJG 3 stationed at Vechta. 1. Staffel {{was under the}} command of Staffelkapitän Oberleutnant Walter Milius. This unit was equipped with the C-variant of the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter. Both Frank and Schierholz were promoted to the rank of Gefreiter on 1 March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Leslie never advertised his speakers. After {{demonstrating a}} {{prototype}} with Bob Mitchell, an organist <b>with</b> <b>radio</b> station KFI in Los Angeles, a contract {{was made to}} install another prototype in the station's studios, where Mitchell {{would be the only}} organist authorized to use it. Mitchell was so impressed that he tried to patent the speaker, but discovered that he could not. Soon afterwards, Mitchell became an organist with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and played a Hammond with the Leslie on its shows, ensuring national exposure for the sound. The Leslie was subsequently a standard component of several notable jazz organists, including Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott. Graham Bond was the first notable British organist to play a Hammond through a Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along <b>with</b> <b>radio</b> and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October {{the weather}} was more {{uncooperative}} than on the previous day. Even though a wider array of targets {{was assigned to the}} task groups, from the Pescadores to northern Luzon and Formosa, far fewer enemies were encountered in the air. Results of the day's strike operations were hard to ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days of strikes helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined <b>with</b> <b>radio</b> intercepts and the dusk strikes fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E
