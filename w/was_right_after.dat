25|$|On October 31, 1999 David Gamkrelidze became {{member of}} the Parliament of Georgia. At the first session sitting, he got elected as {{chairman}} of the Healthcare and Social Issues Committee. Gradually, David Gamkrelidze and his friends realized that the ruling party did not actually care for their professionalism and commitment to the matters of national importance. The period of disenchantment began, which reached its peak in the spring of 2000. That <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the ruling party presented to the Parliament the budget for ratification in 1999 and demanded from the majority of the party to endorse it.|$|E
25|$|During interbellum period Lwów {{had grown}} {{significantly}} from 219,000 inhabitants in 1921, to 312,200 in 1931 {{and an estimated}} number of 318,000 residents in 1939. Although Poles constituted a majority, Jews formed more than a one-fourth of population. Ukrainian minority was also sizable one. There were also other minorities, including Germans, Armenians, Karaims, Georgians etc. maybe numerically not significant, but enriching Lwów's multicultural character and heritage. The city <b>was,</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> capital Warsaw, {{the second most important}} cultural and academic centre of Poland (in academical year 1937/38 there were 9,100 students, attending 5 higher education facilities including widely renowned university and institute of technology). Together with Poznań, Lwów was Poland's trade fairs centre, with internationally renowned Targi Wschodnie (The Eastern Trade Fair) held annually since 1921, which had fostered city's economical growth.|$|E
500|$|... {{all came}} down to one {{sentence}} in the [...] "X" [...] article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should {{do everything possible to}} contain it and not let them expand any further. I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it.|$|E

500|$|The five [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{are often}} {{interpreted}} as representing Wordsworth's opposing views {{of nature as}} well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy {{can be seen as}} a connection between humanity and nature, as a [...] "boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence." [...] Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy's life—she was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), [...] "not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature", while [...] "her death <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> <b>after</b> all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby".|$|E
500|$|In 1938 Enugu {{became the}} {{administrative}} {{capital of the}} Eastern Region. The number of employed coal miners in Enugu grew from 6,000 (of mostly Udi men) in 1948 to 8,000 in 1958. Enugu's population rose sharply with its industrialisation; {{the population of the}} city reached 62,000 in 1952. Mining in Enugu was sometimes turbulent, as demonstrated by the events of 18 November 1949 when 21 striking miners were shot and killed and 51 wounded by police under British governance. The massacre that {{came to be known as}} [...] "The Iva Valley Shooting" [...] fuelled nationalist or [...] "Zikist" [...] sentiments among most Nigerians, and especially amongst Eastern Nigerians. [...] "Zikisim" [...] was a post World War II movement that was created out of admiration for Nnamdi Azikiwe who was a prominent nationalist of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). The shooting <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> a period of unrest when miners were angered by the belief that their full pay was being held back by the colliery management, a belief that was pushed by the nationalist press. Many of the Zikists tried to use the Iva Valley shooting to fuel their nationalistic agenda and push the British imperial administration, out of Nigeria.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E

2500|$|Emil Isac's {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} modernist literature in Romanian-speaking areas was pioneering: deemed [...] "the first 'modernist' Transylvanian poet" [...] by critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, he was also called [...] "a [...] exception {{on the other side of}} the Carpathians" [...] by literary historian Paul Cernat. Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of isolationism: [...] "I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that I <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> all, in maintaining that, to us Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory. [...] The world is not aware of us, because our nationalism has sealed us hermetically in front of all propitious influences." ...|$|E
2500|$|Called [...] "3 {{percent at}} 50," [...] it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 {{percent of their}} highest year's pay for every year of service. Before it was {{approved}} and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> Sept. 11," [...] said Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach. [...] "All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion." [...] He called it [...] "one of the biggest shifts of money {{from the private sector}} to the public sector." [...] Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal. [...] Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a [...] "nuclear bomb" [...] for deputies.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, he {{is known}} to have resorted to extreme {{measures}} of sense control which involve self-abnegation methods like fasting for months together (having just a cup of tea a day) while taking huge quantities of food at other times. During this time, he confined himself in a dark room with a lamp that used to be lit up at all times. He would often be found lying on bed while facing the wall. He did not allow very many people in his room during this period. Whole room and his bed used to be covered with a lot of dust and one could find cobwebs and spiders around the room but he wouldn't bother cleaning it or let anyone else clean it. A rat is said to have nibbled a hole into one of his heels during this time though he {{is said to have been}} oblivious to its pain. His only constant companion in the room besides the burning lamp was his pipe. During this time he would take intoxicants like opium and sometimes vomit a lot of blood. His whole body had swollen and had become weak. On one occasion his sister reminded him of the financial difficulties they were going through but he is said to have responded by saying (translated here into English) [...] "our boat is in the middle of ocean right now, either we would reach ashore safe or drown". Some religious writers think he might have practised some form of tantric spiritual practice like pranabhasya during this time. After seven such years of his spiritual practice, his devotees affirm that he had become, what they call in Hinduism, a siddha purusha (one who attains spiritual powers) as it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> this period that people started flocking him to get their worldly problems solved.|$|E
