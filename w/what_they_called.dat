Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|When the Aryans first {{settled in}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the Āryāvarta (or Madhyadesha), Allahabad (then Kaushambi) was an {{important}} part of their territory. The Kurus, rulers of Hastinapur (near present-day Delhi), established the town of Kaushambi near Allahabad. They shifted their capital to Kaushambi when Hastinapur was destroyed by floods.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the city center, then make a 120° turn and return along {{the route of the}} Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Birmingham {{was one of}} the most racially divided cities in the United States, both as {{enforced}} by law and culturally. Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted to draw attention to their problems. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country. Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end segregation in public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> Project C, a series of sit-ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, {{and the only}} demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the {{abolition}} of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> slavery: they objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) {{and the use of}} whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high carbon steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the term}} Germanic has a {{linguistic}} definition today, Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus did not clearly divide the Celts from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> the Germans based on languages.
