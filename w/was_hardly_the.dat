25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but it <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E

[...] Eric Ditzian of MTV News desired for the contestant to tap into his R and soul music roots further and concluded, [...] "Last night's performance <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> stuff of Luther Vandross, as Randy Jackson and Simon Cowell maintained, but it's a comparison that Mike should take to heart." [...] Leslie Grey Steeler of The Palm Beach Post acknowledged Lynche was usually cheesy in his performances, but favored his rendition of [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", saying, [...] "I loved it" [...] and calling it [...] "awesome". Mary T. Kelly of Salon.com commented, [...] "Big Mike went back to good, ole country basics and sang the song sweet, simple and pure. Tammy Tyree would have been proud." [...] Lynche {{was placed in the}} bottom three that week, and later eliminated.|$|E

500|$|The death scenes {{attracted}} over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to}} {{the television}} watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. In the wake of the complaints, BBC insiders had admitted that the scenes [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] some of the viewers, but also defended their decision to show the scene as it would show the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated that despite the shocking content; [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative," [...] however the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come. Garrett refuted this, stating: [...] "Not only was there a clear warning before the programme began, but for anyone who missed that, {{the subject matter of the}} episode (a conspiracy to stir up inter-racial violence perpetrated by a man who clearly beat his wife) <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oceania" [...] was [...] "spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal whoopings", {{according}} to David Hooper from BBC Music. The Guardians writer David Peschek {{said that when}} the singer sings in the song, [...] "choral swoops [...] like fireworks behind her". AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the song, along with Medúllas lead single [...] "Who Is It", [...] "have an alien quality {{that is all the}} stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human (except for the odd keyboard or two)". Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought [...] "Oceania" [...] <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> most obvious choice for a promotional single release, despite its [...] "bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples". Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song, stating that it was the best Olympic theme song, but during the Olympics performance, [...] "when she sang 'Every pearl is a lynx is a girl' we think you could hear the world collectively sigh, 'Where's Celine Dion?'". In 2005, the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones' [...] "Sunrise".|$|E

[...] Jon Bershad of Mediaite commented, [...] "It’s as tense and exciting as expected." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author [...] "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist". Joe Flint of Los Angeles Times commented about changes in the media industry since Carter's prior book The Late Shift, [...] "The only difference is that the media world has changed a lot then, and while [...] "The Late Shift" [...] had a lot of inside dirt and drama that was news to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote, [...] "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: the guy with the best contract, wins", and called the book, [...] "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher". Writing for ABC News, journalist Sheila Marikar commented, [...] "Bill Carter's new book, 'The War for Late Night,' reveals what happened behind the scenes, the expletives that were hurled during closed-door discussions, the roller coaster that O'Brien, Leno, and their cohorts rode during that tumultuous time." ...|$|E

500|$|Retrospective {{reception}} of the Sega CD is mixed, praising certain titles in its game library but criticizing its low value for money and limitations on the benefits it provides to the Genesis. GamePro listed the Sega CD as the 7th-worst selling video game console of all time, with reviewer Blake Snow noting that [...] "The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn't do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience." [...] Snow went on to note, however, that the Sega CD did have in its library [...] "the greatest Sonic game of all time" [...] in Sonic CD. IGN's Levi Buchanan criticized Sega's implementation of CD technology for the Genesis, noting, [...] "What good is the extra storage space if there is nothing inventive {{to be done with}} it? No new gameplay concepts emerged from the SEGA CD—it just offered more of the same. In fact, with few exceptions like Sonic CD, it often offered some of the 16-bit generation's worst games, like Demolition Man." [...] Jeremy Parish of USgamer pointed out that [...] "Sega <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> only company to muddy its waters with a CD add-on in the early '90s" [...] and highlighted some [...] "gems" [...] for the system, but cautioned [...] "the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against the fact that the add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [...]" [...] Writing for Retro Gamer, Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD's limited sales, including the add-on's high price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis console, and lack of ability to function without a console attached. Retro Gamer writer Aaron Birch, however, defended the Sega CD and wrote that [...] "the single biggest cause of the Mega-CD's failure was the console itself. When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing in The Independent, Neela Debnath praised Coleman's performance, {{articulating}} {{that she}} [...] "impressed again with her fury {{as she held}} the Doctor to account. This is the grown up assistant the Time Lord needs {{to keep him in}} check" [...] and ultimately closed her review by saying [...] "'Kill the Moon' was an enclosed space adventure with all the claustrophobia that an episode like this demands [...] It <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> strongest episode of the series but it was no car crash either.". Radio Times heavily praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5/5. They also praised Coleman's performance, stating that [...] "Coleman expertly conveys Clara’s terrible dilemma – and later her tearful fury at the Doctor’s behaviour". They described the episode's writing as [...] "audacious, highly imaginative, and is well matched by Paul Wilmshurst’s supremely eerie, cinematic direction", and closed their review by noting [...] "Portentous dialogue, sharp direction, urgent music and a powerhouse performance from Peter Capaldi make this one of the defining moments of the season".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{science fiction}} fans felt {{compelled}} to condemn the Shaver Mystery as [...] "the Shaver Hoax". These fans, already distressed by Palmer's shift away from the literary or hard science fiction of earlier years to often slapdash space opera, organized letter-writing campaigns {{to try to persuade}} the publishers of Amazing Stories to cease all Shaver Mystery articles. In fact, Palmer printed a number of critical or skeptical letters sent to Amazing Stories, and he and other contributors occasionally rebutted or replied to such letters in print. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, [...] "he young Harlan Ellison, later a famously abrasive writer, allegedly badgered [...] into admitting that the Shaver Mystery was a 'publicity grabber'; when the story came out, Palmer angrily responded that this <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> same thing as calling it a hoax". Dash writes that the [...] "critics of the 'Shaver Mystery' were {{quick to point out that}} its author was suffering from several of the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, and that many of the letters pouring into Amazing recounting personal experiences that backed up the author's stories patently came from the sorts of people who would otherwise spend their time claiming that they were being persecuted by invisible voices or their neighbor's dog".|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Brando {{appeared}} in The Young Lions, dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a German accent for the role, which he later admitted was not convincing. The film {{is based on}} the novel by Irwin Shaw, and Brando's portrayal of the character Christian Diestl was controversial for its time. He later wrote, [...] "The original script closely followed the book, in which Shaw painted all Germans as evil caricatures, especially Christian, whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about Nazism; he was mean, nasty, vicious, a cliché of evil... I thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently 'bad' people in the world, but they can easily be misled." [...] Shaw and Brando even appeared together for a televised interview with CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun and, during a bombastic exchange, Shaw charged that, like most actors, Brando was incapable of playing flat-out villainy; Brando responded by stating [...] "Nobody creates a character but an actor. I play the role; now he exists. He is my creation." [...] The Young Lions also features Brando's only appearance in a film with friend and rival Montgomery Clift (although they shared no scenes together). Brando closed out the decade by appearing in The Fugitive Kind (1960) opposite Anna Magnani. The film was based on another play by Tennessee Williams but <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> success A Streetcar Named Desire had been, with the Los Angeles Times labeling Williams's personae [...] "psychologically sick or just plain ugly" [...] and The New Yorker calling it a [...] "cornpone melodrama".|$|E
