5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that <b>while</b> <b>for</b> many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice.

Males reach maturity after around 9 months, <b>while</b> <b>for</b> the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the extent of wage mobility both <b>while</b> working <b>for</b> the same firm and when moving to a new firm. We find that mean wage growth between jobs is large in comparison to wage growth <b>while</b> working <b>for</b> the same employer, especially for less educated workers who experience low mean wage growth between jobs but even lower wage growth <b>while</b> working <b>for</b> the same employer. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity in wage growth both within and between firms. We, therefore, focus on both the means of the wage change distributions and on the probability that a worker does not experience real wage growth either <b>while</b> working <b>for</b> the same employer or moving to a new employer. We find that while real wages do grow with experience on the average job, a substantial proportion of workers experience real declines in wages <b>while</b> working <b>for</b> the same employer or moving to a new employer. ...|$|R
