25|$|The {{original}} {{release of}} Barber's Symphony No. 2 was widely criticized for various reasons. Several critics {{felt that the}} work {{was little more than}} war time propaganda. Many people complained about the inclusion of the electronic tone-generator in a symphonic work. Despite much criticism, the work also received many positive reviews. The work was generally viewed as Barber's most ambitious and contemporary work. There was a great sense of tension and energy in the work that <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> to audiences.|$|E
25|$|University Chancellor Wesley Posvar {{took action}} {{to revive the}} {{football}} program and hired Johnny Majors from Iowa State to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7–7. The excitement in the city <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6–5–1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. The stage was thus set for the 1976 edition of the Panthers {{to make a run}} for the National Championship.|$|E
500|$|Brynner termed Rodgers' account [...] "very picturesque, but totally inaccurate". He {{recalled}} {{that as an}} established television director (in CBS's Starlight Theatre, for example), {{he was reluctant to}} go back on the stage. His wife, his agent and Martin finally convinced him to read Hammerstein's working script, and once he did, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to do the project. In any case, Brynner's fierce, mercurial, dangerous, yet surprisingly sensitive King was an ideal foil for Lawrence's strong-willed, yet vulnerable Anna, and when the two finally came together in [...] "Shall We Dance?", where the King hesitantly touches Anna's waist, the chemistry <b>was</b> <b>palpable.</b>|$|E

500|$|Gareth McLean in The Guardian {{rejects the}} notion that Buffy is similar to other [...] "schmaltzy American teen show(s)" [...] like Dawson's Creek: [...] "This episode was a brave, honest and {{wrenching}} portrayal of death and loss. The way this was handled by Joss Whedon ... was ingenious. Time slowed down and the feeling of numbness <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> as Buffy and her gang tried {{to come to terms}} with Joyce's death." [...] McLean especially appreciated the small details of Buffy protecting Joyce's dignity and the confusion shown by the characters. He concludes, [...] "Joyce may be dead but long live Buffy the Vampire Slayer." [...] Joe Gross in the Austin American-Statesman calls the episode [...] "devastatingly calm" [...] and states that [...] "the entire cast and crew should have received some sort of Emmy for 'The Body.|$|E
500|$|Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley {{had left}} for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major {{argument}} and no chance {{to come to a}} reconciliation. Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London <b>was</b> <b>palpable.</b> She wrote to Mary of [...] "the dreadful state of mind I generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of". Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her. Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same [...] "extreme depression to which her mother had been subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family". Wandering amongst the mountains of Switzerland, frustrated with her relationship with Shelley, and engrossed by the writing of Frankenstein, her sister was unsympathetic.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance, Billboards Brad Wete said: [...] "There’s {{something}} to be said about simplicity when whatever’s simply being done is awesome. Bruno Mars never moved more than three steps in any direction during his performance. His voice soared and his passion <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> as he performed". He concluded, [...] "when his time came, Mars left his mark". Mathew Jacobs of The Huffington Post believes that [...] "the jazzy new song marked one of the night's tamer moments". He praised Mars performance by saying he [...] "offered a brand of artistry unmatched by the bulk of the telecast." [...] Grading the performances of the show, the staff from Entertainment Weekly gave Mars' performance an A-, describing it as [...] "The most elegantly designed and executed performance of the evening". MTV News' Brenna Ehrlich classified the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards performance as a [...] "show that rivaled anything you'd find in the city's famous — and infamous — Red Light District". The UK edition of The Huffington Post commented that despite Mars' voice being on top form, it was the pole-dancer performance who stole the show. Other performers, such as Ed Sheeran and Adam Lambert praised the interpretation by calling it an amazing performance and noticing Mars' vocals, respectively. Hilary Duff called [...] "Gorilla" [...] a [...] "straight baby making music".|$|E

50|$|Splenomegaly refers {{strictly}} to spleen enlargement, and {{is distinct from}} hypersplenism, which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism should not be confused. Each may be found separately, or they may coexist. Clinically if a spleen <b>is</b> <b>palpable,</b> it means it is enlarged as it has to undergo at least twofold enlargement to become palpable. However, {{the tip of the}} spleen may <b>be</b> <b>palpable</b> in a newborn baby up to 3 months of age.|$|R
500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 USS Cole bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension <b>was</b> <b>palpable.</b> The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he voted for Bush on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but the American people are growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg. Harrison later said that [...] "a lot of ghosts materialised {{out of the}} woodwork – people you didn't necessarily want to see again, who had been your best friend one drunken Preludin night back in 1960." [...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet we were still just the boys. But we knew and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions put to them at press conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience <b>was</b> <b>palpable,</b> leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|After Stalin's stroke, Beria {{claimed to}} have killed him. This aborted a final purge of Old Bolsheviks Mikoyan and Molotov, for which Stalin had been laying the groundwork in the year prior to his death. Shortly after Stalin's death, Beria {{announced}} triumphantly to the Politburo that he had [...] "done [...] in" [...] and [...] "saved [...] all", according to Molotov's memoirs. Notably, Beria never explicitly stated whether he had initiated Stalin's stroke or had merely delayed his treatment in the hope he would die (as argued by Sebag-Montefiore). Support for the assertion that Stalin was poisoned with warfarin by Beria's associates has been presented from several sources, including Edvard Radzinsky in his biography Stalin and {{a recent study by}} Miguel A. Faria in the journal Surgical Neurology International [...] Warfarin (4-Hydroxycoumarins) is cited as the likely agent; it would have produced the symptoms reported, and administering it into Stalin's food or drink was well within the operational abilities of Beria's NKVD. Sebag-Montefiore does not dispute the possibility of an assassination by poison masterminded by Beria, whose hatred for Stalin <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> by this point, but also notes that Beria never made mention of poison or confessed to using it, even during his later interrogations, and was never alone with Stalin during the period prior to his stroke (he always went with Malenkov to defer suspicion).|$|E

60|$|They {{went right}} to the bows of the softly {{plunging}} vessel. In the complete obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where a great rope was coiled up. It was quite near the very point of the ship, near the black, unpierced space ahead. There they sat down, folded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into each other, and become one substance. It was very cold, and the darkness <b>was</b> <b>palpable.</b>|$|E
60|$|Owen behaved very {{properly}} and with much feeling. When not driving it out by other things, the fact <b>was</b> <b>palpable</b> {{to him that}} he had brought this fair young creature to her grave; and in the very scenes where her beauty and enthusiastic affection had captivated him, association revived his earlier admiration, and swept away his futile apology that she had brought the whole upon herself. A gust of pity, love, and remorse convulsed his frame, and though too proud to give way, his restrained anguish touched every heart, and almost earned him Mr. Prendergast's forgiveness.|$|E
50|$|Cervical {{lymphadenopathy}} {{is a sign}} or a symptom, not a diagnosis. The causes are varied, and may be inflammatory, degenerative, or neoplastic. In adults, healthy {{lymph nodes}} can <b>be</b> <b>palpable</b> (able to <b>be</b> felt), in the axilla, neck and groin. In children up {{to the age of}} 12 cervical nodes up to 1 cm in size may <b>be</b> <b>palpable</b> and this may not signify any disease. If nodes heal by resolution or scarring after being inflamed, they may remain palpable thereafter. In children, most <b>palpable</b> cervical lymphadenopathy <b>is</b> reactive or infective. In individuals over the age of 50, metastatic enlargement from cancers (most commonly squamous cell carcinomas) of the aerodigestive tract should be considered.|$|R
