5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Potiorek {{planned to}} launch a {{converging}} attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> transportation hub for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Alamo (February 23 – March 6, 1836) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> {{conflict}} of the Texas Revolution. In 1835, colonists from the United States joined with Tejanos (Mexicans born in Texas) in putting up armed {{resistance to the}} centralization of the Mexican government. President Antonio López de Santa Anna and the government in Mexico City believed the United States had instigated the insurrection with a goal of annexing Texas.|$|E

Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E

5|$|The hospital, built between 1857 and 1859, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> {{component}} of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which {{could only be}} provided if the convicts were healthy. Located in the north-eastern corner of the prison compound, the building is H-shaped in plan, single storey with rendered and painted limestone walls. It features a wide verandah with timber posts. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished, and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the tag of The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team {{to go through a}} league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture between the two sides at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of the Buffet or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was the only New York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
5|$|German {{classical}} music includes works {{by some of}} the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Ludwig van Beethoven <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic idiom. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat {{with one of the}} smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> factor in ensuring {{that the loss of}} qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Chesapeake, {{also known}} as the Battle of the Virginia Capes or simply the Battle of the Capes, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> naval battle in the American Revolutionary War that took place near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781. The combatants were a British fleet led by Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves and a French fleet led by Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, the Comte de Grasse. The battle was {{strategically}} decisive, in that it prevented the Royal Navy from reinforcing or evacuating the forces of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. The French were able to achieve control of the sea lanes against the British, allowing them to provide the Franco-American army with siege artillery and French reinforcements—all of which proved decisive in the Siege of Yorktown, effectively securing independence for the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, emmer, and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, and olives, dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted of pork, beef, and lamb. Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E
