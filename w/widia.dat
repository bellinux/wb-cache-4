50|$|In 1924, the Raw Steel Association (Rohstahlgemeinschaft) was {{established}} in Luxembourg, as a quota-fixing cartel for coal and steel, by France, Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. Germany, however, chose to violate quotas and pay fines, in order to monopolize the Ruhr’s output and continue making high-grade steel. In 1926, Krupp began the manufacture of <b>Widia</b> (“Wie Diamant”) cobalt-tungsten carbide. In 1928, German industry under Krupp leadership put down a general strike, locking out 250,000 workers, and encouraging the government to cut wages 15%. In 1929, the Chrysler Building was capped with Krupp steel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{context of}} the quote has been {{variously}} conjectured. Rickert speculated that the situation resembled {{the scene in the}} Waldere fragment, [...] "in which <b>Widia,</b> Wate's grandson, and Hildebrand rescue Theodoric from a den of monsters". Karl P. Wentersdorf stated that [...] "Wade is here boasting of his victorious adventures with many kinds of creatures". Alaric Hall ventures that some antagonistic force has magically [...] "sent" [...] (and other beings) to beset Wade is beset by monsters, though he cautions that the fragment is too short for certitude.|$|E
5000|$|Dietrich {{furthermore}} {{is mentioned}} in the Old English poems Waldere, Deor and Widsith. Deor marks the first mention to Dietrich's [...] "thirty years" [...] (probably his exile) and refers to him, like the Rök stone, as a Mæring. The Waldere makes mention of Dietrich's liberation from the captivity of giants by Witige (<b>Widia),</b> for which Dietrich rewarded Witige with a sword. This liberation forms {{the plot of the}} later fantastical poem Virginal and is {{mentioned in the}} historical poem Alpharts Tod. Widsith mentions him among a number of other Gothic heroes, including Witige, Heime, the Harlungen and Ermanaric, and in connection with a battle with Attila's Huns. However, the exact relationship between the figures is not explained.|$|E

Among the Indo-Aryan rulers of Palestine mentioned in the Amarna letters we find Induruta as lord of Achshaph, Biridiya as lord of Megiddo, <b>Widia</b> as lord of Ashkelon, Shuwardata as lord of Hebron, Zatatna and Surata as lords of Acre, Biryawaza as lord of Damascus, and other places, while Abdu-Heba, lord of Jerusalem has a Hurrian name.|$|E
5000|$|The initial {{development}} of cemented and sintered carbides occurred in Germany in the 1920s. ThyssenKrupp says historical present, [...] "Sintered tungsten carbide {{was developed by}} the [...] "Osram study society for electrical lighting" [...] to replace diamonds as a material for machining metal. Not having the equipment to exploit this material on an industrial scale, Osram sells the license to Krupp at the end of 1925. In 1926 Krupp brings sintered carbide onto the market under the name <b>WIDIA</b> (acronym for WIe DIAmant = like diamond)." [...] Green et al give the date of carbide tools' commercial introduction as 1927. Burghardt and Axelrod give the date of their commercial introduction in the United States as 1928. Subsequent development occurred in various countries.|$|E
5000|$|Hall's success, in his {{telling of}} the story, came about because of his {{determination}} to go his own way with a radical redesign of the press, which employed a doughnut-shaped binding ring (the belt) which confined the sample chamber and two curved and tapered pistons which pressed on the sample chamber. He [...] "bootlegged" [...] the machining of the first hardened steel version of this press, which showed some promise, and eventually got management to approve the construction {{of it in the}} tougher, much more expensive Carboloy (tungsten carbide dispersed in cobalt, also known as <b>Widia).</b> However, his experiments were [...] "relegated" [...] (Hall claimed) to a smaller, antique, leaky 400 ton press, rather than a more expensive and new thousand ton press used by other members of the team.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{an adopted}} abrasive-diffusive wear model is {{proposed}} and implemented into a 3 D Finite Element code {{to study the}} tool wear phenomenon. In particular, the Authors found that FE procedure based only on diffusive mechanism shown some problems when the extension on crater area was investigated. This {{can be related to}} the absence of the wear abrasion term on the utilized model. Therefore, in this work, the Authors improved the previous utilized tool wear model introducing into the sub-routine the abrasive term on the basis of Usui’s model. A series of 3 D FEM simulations were conducted in order to estimate the tool wear development in turning operations. The adopted abrasive-diffusive wear model will give the possibility of correctly evaluating the tool wear of actual turning operations during both the initial transient phase, where the abrasive mechanism is dominant, and the steady-state phase, in which the diffusion is the main wear mechanism. The FEM results were compared with experimental data, obtained turning AISI 1045 steel with <b>WIDIA</b> P 40 inserts, showing a satisfactory agreement...|$|E
40|$|Cemented carbides, {{also known}} as <b>Widia,</b> are hard metals {{produced}} by sintering process and widely used in mechanical machining. They show high cutting capacity and good wear resistance; consequently, they result to be excellent materials for manufacturing cutting tools and sandblast nozzles. In this work, the wear resistance of WC-Co carbides containing Eta-phase, a secondary phase present in the hard metals when a carbon content deficiency occurs, is analyzed. Different mixtures of carbide are prepared and sintered, with different weight percentages of carbon, in order to form Eta-phase and then analyze how the carbon content influences the wear resistance of the material. This characterization is carried out by abrasive wear tests. The test parameters are chosen considering the working conditions of sandblast nozzles. Additional information is gathered through microscopic observations and the evaluation of hardness and microhardness of the different mixtures. The analyses highlight {{that there is a}} limit of carbon content below which bad sintering occurs. Considering the mixtures without these sintering problems, they show a wear resistance depending on the size and distribution of the Eta-phase; moreover, the one with high carbon content deficiency shows the best performance...|$|E

In the {{educational}} world, writing proficiency becomes measurement for the learner’s knowledge. When the writer or student tries to restate {{in their own}} word {{they need to learn}} about paraphrasing. A sentence which expresses the same proposition as another sentence is a paraphrase of that sentence (assuming the same referents for any referring expressions involved). Paraphrase is to sentences (on individual interpretations) as synonymy is to predicates (though some semanticists talk loosely of synonymy in the case of sentences as well. On the other hand paraphrasing has a tight relation with entailments in semantics field. That is, two sentences may be said to be paraphrases of each other if and only if they have exactly the same set of entailments; or, which comes to the same thing, if and only if they mutually entail each other so that whenever one is true the other must also be true. The researcher found some students fail when do paraphrasing. The aims of this reseach is to know how the EFL learners use entailments in their writing and criteria that shows the extent quality of entailments complies with a good paraphrase with semantics perspective. Technique and data collection procedure conducted by elicitation. This reasearch will used Survey Based Research. The researcher follows the step of collecting data research of Susan M. Gass and Alison Mackey. Data collection is by using questionnaire and interview. The questionnaire was gave to the 20 high achiever learners in writing class. This research was in the sentence level. The total questions of questionnaire are 10 sentences and the learner asked to paraphrase the sentences. 10 respondents also interviewed. The result of this analysis shows that there are different strategy in learners paraphrasing writing. Those eight strategies are available on Open Journal of Modern Linguistics compiled by Villa, Marti, & Rodriguez, Paraphrase Grammar bySmaby, R., and An Introduction to English Semantics and Pragmatics by Pattrick Griffiths. The types of paraphrasing strategy are Change of Order, Additional/ Deletation, Synonym Substitution, Passive Transformation, Direct/ Indirect Style Alternation, Complementary, Derivational Substitution, Hyponym Hierarchy Substitution, and Change of Format. In total 200 target sentences from 20 respondents were taken from questionnaire, 58 sentences used Change of Order, 35 sentences were paraphrased with Additional/ Deletation, 30 sentences used Synonym Substitution, 17 sentences used Passive Transformation, 5 sentences used Direct/Indirect Style Alternation, 3 sentences used Complementary Substitution, 1 sentences used Derivational Change, 2 sentences used Hyponym ix Hierarchy Substitution, and 1 sentences used Change of Format and the other target sentences (49 sentences) are includes in not a paraphrase classification. There are four criterias that shows the extent quality of entailment complies with a good paraphrase by respondents, they are accuratecomplete, written in their own voice, and make a sense in theirparaphrasing. On the researcher research, in total 200 sentences from 20 respondents were taken from the questionnaire. 151 sentences counted as good paraphrases and 49 sentences counted as not paraphrases. In total 20 respondents, 4 respondents answered the questionnaire and all of the sentences were included in a good paraphrase criterion. They are R. 4, R. 6, R. 8, and R. 12. 16 others have a not a good criteria and good paraphrase criteria. On the other hands, 16 others included into a respondent that still found not a good paraphrase criteria on their paraphrases, they are R. 1, R. 2, R. 3, R. 5, R. 7, R. 9, R. 10, R. 11, R. 13, R. 14,R. 15, R. 16, R. 17, R. 18, R. 19 and R. 20 Key words: Entailments, Paraphrase, Writing Strategy, EFL Learner...|$|E
