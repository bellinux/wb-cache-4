40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between gallstones/cholecystectomy and colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective study including all the patients <b>with</b> different <b>cancers</b> treated in our surgical unit from 1995 until 2010. We analyzed 1696 patients: 1072 <b>with</b> colorectal <b>cancer,</b> 404 <b>with</b> gastric <b>cancer,</b> 119 <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>cancer,</b> 11 <b>with</b> gallbladder <b>cancer</b> and 70 <b>with</b> renal <b>cancer.</b> RESULTS: Gallstones were significantly associated <b>with</b> colon <b>cancer</b> (8. 8 %) than with gastric (3 %) or renal cancer (2. 2 %) – P= 0. 001, respectively P= 0. 04.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} The prethrombotic state {{can be observed}} in advanced lung cancer patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the relationship between coagulation and fibrinolysis marks on pathophysiological characteristics and prognosis in patients <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> Methods The coagulation and fibgrinolysismarks were detected in sixty patients <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> and twenty normal controls. Results The D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products, plasma fibrinogen were significantly higher than those of normal controls. The plasma antithrombin Ⅲ was significantly lower than those of normal controls. All marks in patients <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> were not related to age, sex, histological classification, the size of the primary tumors, P-TNM stages, distant metastasis. The plasma levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen in patients <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> were negatively correlated to survival. Conclusion The patients <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> have abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis state, these contribute to hypercoagulability state and thrombi.

40|$|Familial {{risks of}} lung cancer are well-established, but whether lung <b>cancer</b> {{clusters}} <b>with</b> other discordant <b>cancers</b> is less certain, particularly beyond smoking-related sites, which may provide evidence on genetic contributions to lung cancer aetiology. We used a novel approach to search for familial associations in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. This involved assessment of familial relative risk for cancer X in families with increasing numbers {{of lung cancer}} patients and, conversely, relative risks for lung <b>cancer</b> in families <b>with</b> increasing numbers of patients <b>with</b> <b>cancers</b> X. However, we lacked information on smoking. The total number of lung cancers in the database was 125   563. We applied stringent statistical criteria and found that seven discordant <b>cancers</b> were associated <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> among family members, and six of these {{were known to be}} connected with smoking: oesophageal, upper aerodigestive tract, liver, cervical, kidney and urinary bladder cancers. A further novel finding was that cancer of unknown primary also associated <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> We also factored in histological evidence and found that anal and connective tissue cancers could be associated <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> for reasons other than smoking. For endometrial and prostate cancers, suggestive negative associations <b>with</b> lung <b>cancer</b> were found. Although we lacked information on smoking it is prudent to conclude that practically all observed discordant associations of lung <b>cancer</b> were <b>with</b> <b>cancers</b> for which smoking is a risk factor...|$|R
40|$|Aims An {{increasing}} number of oncologists will be confronted with individuals having diabetes and cancer. We assessed changes in patient-, tumour- and treatment-related variables in patients <b>with</b> colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> and without diabetes. Methods All 17 170 cases of primary colorectal cancer between 1995 and 2010 in the South-Eastern Netherlands were included. The Cochrane–Armitage test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyse trends. Results In total, 11 893 patients were diagnosed <b>with</b> colon <b>cancer</b> and 5277 <b>with</b> rectal <b>cancer,</b> of whom 1711 (14 %) and 609 (12 %), respectively, had diabetes {{at the time of}} <b>cancer</b> diagnosis. Patients <b>with</b> colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> diabetes compared with those without were approximately 5 years older and more often diagnosed with proximal colon tumours (60 vs. 54 %; P < 0. 0001). Chemotherapy administration significantly increased in patients with stage III colon <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> and without diabetes (from 17 % in 1995 – 1998 to 50 % in 2007 – 2010, 38 % to 63 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001). However, in the most recent period, and after adjusting for the co-variables age, gender, year of diagnosis and specific co-morbidities, patients with stage III colon <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> diabetes received adjuvant chemotherapy less frequently than those without [odds ratio 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 5 – 0. 9); P = 0. 002]. The proportion of patients with stage II/III rectal <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> and without diabetes who underwent radiotherapy has been similar in recent years (91 vs. 87 %). Conclusions Although the administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy increased between 1995 and 2010 in patients <b>with</b> colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> and without diabetes, patients <b>with</b> colorectal <b>cancer</b> <b>with</b> diabetes continue to receive chemotherapy less frequently than those without diabetes...|$|R
