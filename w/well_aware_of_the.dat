5|$|Baby Connor was a {{main focus}} of season three, but the creators were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{limitations}} of a baby character. With Connor’s initial role in plot decided, {{they came up with}} the concept of a 'teenage' version for further appearances.|$|E
5|$|Hergé later {{concluded}} that the scene in which Tintin hoodwinked the Inca with {{his knowledge of the}} sun was implausible, suggesting that solar worshipers with a keen knowledge of astronomy like the Inca would have been <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun and its eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Sir David Lindsay {{would have}} been <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{symbolic}} allusions of the carvings. In correspondence with his brother, Lord Menmuir, he discusses {{the relationship of the}} planets to the metals, which he had employed Hans Ziegler to search for on his land. Sir David's nephew, David Lindsay, 1st Lord Balcarres, was noted for his interest in alchemy and the Rosicrucians.|$|E

5|$|As {{evident in}} his {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it. Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in Nanjing. The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 {{in order to obtain}} Buddhist texts.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{scope and}} {{scale of the}} Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformations that {{were taking place}} and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in {{the manner of the}} Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
50|$|The biggest defect was {{the washing}} machine, which was {{outside in the}} open, without proper wiring or proper waste disposal, {{followed}} by an improperly built deck, all <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> Youngs were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> sale.|$|R

5|$|Officers in {{the field}} were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote {{that this was just}} an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} have a moment of silence on their home opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less-than-friendly {{reaction}} it was likely to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter {{was the only time}} that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
60|$|When Miss Bailey {{had gone}} on down the village street, Mrs. Falconer paused {{for a few moments}} at her gate, {{apparently}} lost in deep thought. She was perfectly <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> hints that had been thrown out for her benefit that afternoon. She knew that the Aids, one and all, thought that she ought to take Camilla Clark. But she had no room to give her--for it was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question to think of putting her in Missy's room.|$|R

50|$|Customers such as Bill Bean are <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> when <b>the</b> {{energy in}} a {{business}} is negative. In an article, he wrote for “The Recorder” he talked about how when he usually visits Ontario Ministry <b>of</b> Health <b>the</b> atmosphere is very dark and cold. On his last visit, the team excitedly welcomed him into the office to renew his Ontario Health Card.

5|$|Manstein favoured an {{immediate}} pincer {{attack on the}} Kursk salient after the battle at Kharkov, but Hitler was concerned that such a plan would draw forces away from the industrial region in the Donets Basin. In any event, the ground was still too muddy to move the tanks into position. In lieu of {{an immediate}} attack, the OKH prepared Operation Citadel, the launching {{of which would be}} delayed while more troops were gathered in the area and the mud solidified. Meanwhile, the Red Army, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> danger of encirclement, also moved in large numbers of reinforcements, and their intelligence reports revealed the expected locations and timing of the German thrusts.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of}} the fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} {{power of the}} Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (အပိ) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of}} the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
50|$|Without {{a dollar}} in his pocket, Russell E. Gardner left {{his home state}} of Tennessee for St. Louis in 1879. Three-and-a-half decades later he was a multi-millionaire. Gardner had made it big in St. Louis by {{manufacturing}} Banner buggies before <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, and unlike many wagon builders, was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> automobile age meant to his business. He got started by building new Chevrolet bodies and alongside, his company was building wagons. By 1915 this had led to <b>the</b> complete assembly <b>of</b> Chevrolets in St. Louis and Russell Gardner controlled all Chevrolet trade west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River.|$|R

5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate {{leaned on}} the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he {{leaned on the}} high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
50|$|Her {{portrayal}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salome {{character was}} very different from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white actresses <b>of</b> her time, and it had to be. <b>Well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> roles she played affected race relations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, she worked hard to break <b>the</b> stereotypes <b>of</b> black women and black actresses as immoral and oversexed. “I am <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that many well-meaning people dislike stage life, especially our women. On that point, I’d say, a woman does not lose her dignity…when she enters stage life,” Walker wrote. In particular, she coordinated her movements and facial expressions in order to express the internal emotions and thoughts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters she was portraying.|$|R

40|$|For {{economic}} and humanitarian reasons, the present trend to institutionalize elderly {{people who could}} remain {{in their own homes}} if they were given adequate support, must be challenged. It is important that the family physician, who knows his patients' needs <b>well,</b> is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resources available. When these are deficient, or poorly coordinated, efforts must be made to improve them. After the patient has been properly assessed, the key to proper alternate services is <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> a coordinated continuum of care, which includes day hospitals, day therapy centres, social daycare centres and a comprehensive home care program...|$|R
