40|$|NoAccording to {{annual reports}} of European and North American ski resort corporations, <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> {{destinations}} are facing stagnating markets {{and at the same}} time challenges in the management of environmentally sensitive mountainous areas and villages. The survival and development of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations are to a large extent centred around strategies for creating competitive advantage {{and at the same time}} meeting the criteria of sustainable tourism laid down by the WTO. In this paper, performance on these two dimensions is combined into the concept of strategic performance. Sustained value creation is suggested as a goal of strategic performance in <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations. Two new models related to the strategic analysis of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations are developed. The first is a suggested configuration of value creation in <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations¿the ¿value fan¿¿and the second is a conceptual organisational model providing a framework for analysis at strategic level of such destinations. The models have emerged from examining the central body of literature in the field of strategic management. Development of the models is part of ongoing research into what kind of organisational structure of <b>winter</b> <b>sports</b> destinations will lead to superior performance in terms of strategic success. Here the concepts of the ¿community model¿ and the ¿corporate model¿ of destination management are introduced...|$|R
