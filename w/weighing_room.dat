25|$|O'Hehir {{subsequently}} {{became a}} staple of the BBC's coverage of the famous annual Grand National steeplechase. He would invariably pick up the commentary at the Becher's Brook fence and take the race to Valentine's Brook, a vital section of the race where many a favourite fell. Foinavon's famous victory in 1967 will be remembered as one of O'Hehir's finest moments in racing commentaries and won him great respect for the speed and smoothness with which he picked out the unconsidered outsider. O'Hehir later confessed {{in an interview that he}} it had been his inability to identify the colours on his card when inspecting the riders silks in the <b>weighing</b> <b>room</b> prior to the race that had led him to question rider John Buckingham who his mount was. Buckingham advised O'Hehir that Foinavon's silks had been changed at the last minute as his regular green colours were considered unlucky. It was because of this chance meeting that he was able to identify the 100/1 outsider and carry the commentary.|$|E

30|$|For the {{tolerance}} experiments, all rice plants were cultured in a plant growth chamber (Conviron atc 26) (30  °C day / 22  °C night). The survival rate and fresh weight were calculated after 18 d of treatment with 150  mM NaCl and recovery in normal conditions for another 10 d. Lipid peroxidation {{was determined by}} measuring the MDA content (Dhindsa and Matowe, 1981). The content of free proline in leaves was determined as described previously. (Bates et al., 1973) Chlorophyll was extracted from the leaves in 10  mL of 80 % acetone for 16  h {{in the dark and}} was determined by measuring the absorbance at 652  nm (Arnon, 1949). To measure the Na+ and K+ concentrations, 2 -week-old hydroponic cultured rice seedlings were supplemented with 150  mM NaCl for 24, 48, or 72  h. Shoots and roots were harvested at the indicated times and all physiological measurements were based on the procedure described by Yang et al. (2015). Measurement of water loss form detached leaves was performed as previously described by Zhang et al. (2015).

5000|$|Initially, {{the club}} was founded as a social and {{literary}} society for those from Orkney and Shetland.

Initially they had used names specifically related to the Isles: [...] "Udaller, Udal-Book and Udal-Right for Member, List of Members and Membership respectively also Huss-Thing, Schynd-Bill, Great Foud and Stem-Rod". Both publications also made fun of the [...] "weaking" [...] pronunciation of viking and of the ambitious statement of intent in the prospectus: [...] "It behoves every one who is directly or indirectly connected with or interested in the North to give the Viking Club such support as will enable it to take its proper place among the foremost societies in Europe". In the words of Punch:If we scratch up a scanty Skanian skill with skald and skal and ski,In the foremost place of societies soon in Europe we'll be!The mockery touched off vehement exchanges of letters in the Orkney Herald and the Shetland News in which St. Magnus was used as a pen name and reference was made to effeminacy and nithings.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Despite {{efforts by}} {{government}} and other agencies, neonatal {{morbidity and mortality}} continues to be high in India. Among other reasons, newborn care practices are major contributors for such high rates. AIMS: To find out the newborn care practices including delivery practices, immediate care given after birth and breast-feeding practices in an urban slum of Delhi. SETTINGS AND DESIGN : Community based, cross-sectional survey in a resettlement colony (a type of urban slum). MATERIALS AND METHODS : Semi-structured, pre-tested schedule was used to interview 82 mothers of newborns in the study area. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Data was analyzed using Epi - info version 6. 04. Fischer exact test and c 2 test were applied. A P value of less than 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION : More than half i. e. 26 (56. 1 &#x 0025;) of home deliveries, which were mostly conducted by dais (24, 91. 3 &#x 0025;) or relatives in 4 (8. 7 &#x 0025;) of home deliveries. Bathing the baby immediately after birth was commonly practiced in 38 (82. 6 &#x 0025;) of home deliveries. Finger was used to clean the air passage {{in most of the}} home deliveries (29, 63 &#x 0025;). About 61 &#x 0025; (28) of home delivered newborns were not <b>weighed</b> at birth. <b>Rooming</b> in was practiced in majority of the cases. A few of home delivered neonates (12) were given injection tetanus toxoid by unqualified practitioners. Use of clip, band or sterile thread to tie the cord and no application to the cord was significantly higher in institutional deliveries. Breast milk as the first feed was significantly more in institutional deliveries. There is an urgent need to reorient health care providers and to educate mothers on clean delivery practices and early neonatal care...|$|R

60|$|Philip {{was ashamed}} {{to give her}} less than the larger sum. She thanked him with just so much effusiveness as was seemly in {{presence}} of the grief he might be supposed to feel, and left him. Philip went back into his sitting-room, cleared away the remains of his supper, {{and sat down to}} read Walsham's Surgery. He found it difficult. He felt singularly nervous. When there was a sound on the stairs he jumped, and his heart beat violently. That thing in the adjoining room, which had been a man and now was nothing, frightened him. The silence seemed alive, as if some mysterious movement were taking place within it; the presence of death <b>weighed</b> upon these <b>rooms,</b> unearthly and terrifying: Philip felt a sudden horror for what had once been his friend. He tried to force himself to read, but presently pushed away his book in despair. What troubled him was the absolute futility of the life which had just ended. It did not matter if Cronshaw was alive or dead. It would have been just as well if he had never lived. Philip thought of Cronshaw young; and it needed an effort of imagination to picture him slender, with a springing step, and with hair on his head, buoyant and hopeful. Philip's rule of life, to follow one's instincts with due regard to the policeman round the corner, had not acted very well there: it was because Cronshaw had done this that he had made such a lamentable failure of existence. It seemed that the instincts could not be trusted. Philip was puzzled, and he asked himself what rule of life was there, if that one was useless, and why people acted in one way rather than in another. They acted according to their emotions, but their emotions might be good or bad; it seemed just a chance whether they led to triumph or disaster. Life seemed an inextricable confusion. Men hurried hither and thither, urged by forces they knew not; and the purpose of it all escaped them; they seemed to hurry just for hurrying's sake.|$|R
