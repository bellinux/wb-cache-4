5|$|The {{work was}} written {{as a direct}} {{response}} to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom Al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> only {{those who believe in}} God can find salvation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E
5|$|Teilhard de Chardin's {{ideas have}} been seen by advocates of the Gaia {{hypothesis}} proposed by James Lovelock, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the living and nonliving parts of Earth {{can be viewed as}} a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others as an extension of endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall.|$|E

5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> some of the organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of {{the tree of life}} was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E

"Infrastructural power" [...] theories, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> {{federalism}} {{is likely}} to emerge when the subunits of a potential federation already have highly developed infrastructures (e.g. they are already constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized states).|$|R
40|$|Intuitively, the {{knowledge}} of one’s own intentional actions is different from {{the knowledge}} of actions of other sorts, including those of other people and unintentional actions of one's own. But how are we to understand this phenomenon? Does it pertain to all actions, under every description under which they are known? If so, then how is this possible? If not, then how should we think about cases that are exceptions to this principle? This paper is a critical survey of recent attempts to answer these questions. I consider views under three headings: "special source" views, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> {{the knowledge of}} one's intentional actions has a non-perceptual source; "special domain" views, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> some but not all aspects of one's intentional actions are known in a special way; and "special character" views, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> the knowledge of intentional actions is special not because of where it comes from, but because of some other respect in which it is different in kind from the knowledge of other thing...|$|R

25|$|Multiple {{alternatives}} have advocates. The contrary constructivist position {{holds that}} human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is idealist, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is essentialist, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> essential differences {{may influence the}} ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is relativist (Cultural relativism), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor {{more or less in}} accord with external reality.|$|E
5000|$|... "Social contract" [...] theories, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> {{federalism}} {{emerges as}} a bargain between a center and a periphery where the center is not powerful enough to dominate the periphery and the periphery is not powerful enough to secede from the center.|$|R
50|$|This {{argument}} {{derives from}} messianic {{interpretations of the}} Old Testament, <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> <b>that</b> humans need deliverance from Yahweh's judgement because of sin, claiming that demons only attempt to stop humans from having faith in a messiah, and can achieve this without mating with humans.|$|R
2500|$|Teleological ethics (Greek telos, [...] "end"; logos, [...] "science") is {{an ethical}} theory <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> the ends or {{consequences}} {{of an act}} determine whether an act is good or evil.

25|$|Closely {{related to}} the deviant {{hypothesis}} is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations {{are the result of}} cult activity. However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, <b>which</b> <b>holds</b> <b>that</b> cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.|$|E
