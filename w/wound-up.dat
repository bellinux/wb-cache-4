While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure <b>wound-up</b> and control returned to ordinary members.|$|E
25|$|Having <b>wound-up</b> the company's affairs, the {{liquidator}} {{must call}} a final {{meeting of the}} members (if it is a members' voluntary winding-up), creditors (if it is a compulsory winding-up) or both (if it is a creditors' voluntary winding-up). The liquidator is then usually required to send final accounts to the Registrar and to notify the court. The company is then dissolved.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the company}} may elect to simply be struck off the Register as a cheaper {{alternative}} to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the Registrar, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause {{to believe that the}} company is not carrying on business or has been <b>wound-up</b> and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, {{the club}} were issued with a winding up order over unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners. The club needed to raise €400,000 {{in a few}} weeks to keep the club from being <b>wound-up.</b> Despite raising some funds by selling some players, it was not enough, and the club was wound up on 27 July 2009. The club however {{successfully}} appealed the decision with the announcement of a friendly (and expected gate receipts) with Scottish club Celtic.|$|E
25|$|A L Bruce Estates Ltd made further {{substantial}} {{losses in}} 1948 and 1949, and was virtually insolvent. However, the government’s need for land for re-settlement after the 1949 famine {{caused it to}} start negotiations with the company. Some of the estate was sold to private buyers, but around 75,000 acres was bought {{by the government in}} 1952, about 47,000 acres of which was of poor quality. These land sales made good the past deficits, and after some disputes between shareholders, the company was <b>wound-up</b> as a solvent entity on 1959.

25|$|Galloways {{were among}} the {{well-known}} promoters of a new business, The Lancashire Steel Company Ltd., in 1863. The intention was that this company would develop a 10acre site at Gorton with buildings, blast furnaces and all the necessaries of steel production by the Bessemer process, in order initially to produce 200 tons a week of steel in blocks weighing up to 10 tons. The site was adjacent to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, for ease of transport. It was planned to eventually produce 20 ton blocks and to equip it with the most powerful tooling so that the company could supply the maritime market. Capitalisation was to be £150,000. In fact, the venture was a failure and it was <b>wound-up</b> in 1867.|$|E

Some of the estate was sold to private buyers, but around 75,000 acres was bought {{by the government in}} 1952, much of which was of poor quality. These land sales made good the past deficits, and before he died in 1954, Alexander Livingstone Bruce saw the completion of the sale of the estate his father had acquired almost 60 years before. Although Alexander’s daughter, Diana Livingstone Bruce opposed liquidation of the company, and prolonged the process for five years in disputes with other shareholders, the company was <b>wound-up</b> as a solvent entity in 1959.|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazines Matthew Cole {{was less}} impressed, believing West had contributed a [...] "powerhouse production" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "requires you to {{tolerate}} the artists' self-mythologizing and put up with their sometimes awkward attempts at experimentation."

500|$|Skaaren's {{first draft}} {{retained}} {{some of the}} more sinister characteristics of McDowell's Betelgeuse, but toned down the character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse's true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in African American Vernacular English. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia's help, transform the exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. [...] It also would have featured deleted scenes such as the real-estate agent, Jane, trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place—Charles and Delia decline), and a reveal on how Beetlejuice had died centuries earlier (that he'd attempted to hang himself while drunk, only to mess it up and died slowly choking to death, rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and <b>wound-up</b> working for Juno before striking it out on his own as a [...] "free-lance Bio-Exorcist".|$|E
500|$|The pennies of Queen Victoria (18371901) {{form one}} of the most {{intricate}} denominations of British coinage, {{both before and after the}} transition from copper to bronze pennies in 1860. [...] A number of specialist books have been published on the many varieties of Victorian pennies. The final years of the copper penny, from 1839 to 1860, saw a portrait of the Queen by William Wyon, usually dubbed the [...] "Young Head". It had a reverse largely unchanged from King William's but for changing an X to a G, thus REX became REG, short for Regina (queen), denoting the fact that the monarch was now a woman. Thus, the legend on Victorian copper pennies was VICTORIA DEI GRATIA/BRITANNIAR REG FID DEF. Copper pennies were issued for all years between 1839 and 1860 except 1840, 1842, 1850, and 1852. The Heaton Mint, of Birmingham, had been founded with equipment from the <b>wound-up</b> Soho Mint. Beginning in the early 1850s, it supplied large quantities of blanks for pennies to the Royal Mint, and at times was called upon to strike pennies, though its mint mark H would not appear on pennies until 1874. These contracts were because of the needs of Ireland (where counterfeits and tokens were common) and the colonies; the large quantities struck in 1797—1807 by Boulton ensured there were no shortages in England, Scotland and Wales.|$|E
500|$|By 2007, Harry and the Potters {{and their}} {{unexpected}} fan based indie music genre of wizard rock have grown {{into an international}} phenomenon. Recently, the band has engaged in charity side-projects and activism within the Harry Potter community. In January 2007, Harry and the Potters created the Wizard Rock EP of the Month Club, a mail order subscription club that released an extended play by a different wizard rock band each month. Reflecting wizard rock's literacy focus, the club raises funds for First Book, a non-profit organization that gives children {{the ability to read}} and own their first new books. In 2007, the Club raised over $13,000 for the organization. They released their first extended play The Enchanted Ceiling in 2007. May 2007 was also the beginning of their large 70-show summer-library tour across the US and Canada called simply [...] "Summer Tour 2007". Like their initial year in 2003, the summer of 2007 would see the release of another Harry Potter book. Harry and the Potters scheduled the mid-point of the tour to arrive back in their home state and celebrate the July 21 midnight release of the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows at Harvard Yard. The festivities became an excuse for a meet-up of a number of wizard rock bands including The Hungarian Horntails and their nemesis Draco and the Malfoys which all played to a large crowd of Harry Potter fans in the Cambridge, Massachusetts college venue. Harry and the Potters resumed their tour which finally <b>wound-up</b> in late August. In Vancouver on July 7, 2007, hundreds of people crowded outside the Vancouver Public Library to see Harry and the Potters. ABC News reported that the band usually charge $5 to $10 for tickets to their shows, though some performances are free. Harry and the Potters said 600 people turned out for a recent show, July 10, 2007, in Portland, Oregon.|$|E

2500|$|Where a {{liquidator}} who is appointed {{pursuant to}} a members' voluntary winding-up subsequently determines {{that the company}} is not in fact insolvent in his opinion (contrary to the solvency declaration made by the board of directors), then the liquidator must either (a) apply to the Court for the company to be <b>wound-up</b> on an insolvent basis, (b) appoint an administrator to the company, or (c) convene a meeting of creditors.

2500|$|A {{compulsory}} liquidation {{is usually}} {{the result of an}} action taken by one or more creditors of an insolvent company. [...] Compulsory liquidation is a statutory procedure which enables a person to apply to the Court for an order that the affairs of a company be <b>wound-up.</b> [...] A number of different people have locus standi to initiate compulsory liquidation proceedings, including not only the company's creditors (who are the most common applicants), but also the company itself, the company's members, the liquidator, ASIC and (in respect of a general insurance company) the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). But in most cases compulsory liquidation will normally be commenced by one or more creditors.|$|E
2500|$|The multimillion-pound {{rebuilding}} of the Molineux Street Stand in 1979 {{was to be}} the catalyst for the club's near-financial ruin during the next decade as difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund it led to receivership and relegation in 1982. The club was [...] "saved" [...] from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player Derek Dougan. Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties, brought immediate promotion back to the First Division under manager Graham Hawkins, but the Bhattis' failure to sufficiently invest in the club soon saw things unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations under different managers through the football divisions, as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being <b>wound-up.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cork City Football Club [...] (...) is an Irish {{association}} {{football club}} based in Cork. The club currently {{plays in the}} League of Ireland Premier Division. The club was founded and elected to the League of Ireland in 1984. It {{was one of the}} first clubs in Ireland (and the first in Cork) to field a team of professional footballers. With the progression of professionalism at the club, continued development of the Turners Cross stadium and the transition to summer football, the club became one of the biggest and best supported clubs in the country. In 2008, financial issues resulted in a period of examinership, and the club's then holding company was <b>wound-up</b> in 2010. A team was entered into the 2010 League of Ireland First Division, before the club re-acquired rights to the name [...] "Cork City Football Club", and was promoted back to the premier division for the 2012 season. Cork City FC won its third premier division title, and first FAI Cup double, during the 2017 season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{meaning of}} {{insolvency}} matters {{for the type}} of legal rule. In general terms insolvency has, since the earliest legislation, depended upon inability to pay debts. The concept is embodied in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(f) which states that a court may grant a petition for a company to be <b>wound-up</b> if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts". This general phrase is, however, given particular definitions depending on the rules for which insolvency is relevant. First, the [...] "cash flow" [...] test for insolvency represented under section 123(1)(e) is that a company is insolvent if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due". This is the main test used for most rules. It guides a court in granting a winding-up order or appoints an administrator. The cash flow test also guides a court in declaring transactions by a company to be avoided on the ground they were at an undervalue, were an unlawful preference or created a floating charge for insufficient consideration. The cash flow test is said to be based on a [...] "commercial view" [...] of insolvency, as opposed to a rigid legalistic view. In Re Cheyne Finance plc, involving a structured investment vehicle, Briggs J held that a court could take into account debts that would become payable in the near future, and perhaps further ahead, and whether paying those debts was likely. Creditors may, however, find it difficult to prove in the abstract that a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Because of this, section 122(1)(a) contains a specific test for insolvency. If a company owes an undisputed debt to a creditor of more than £750, the creditor sends a written demand, but after three weeks the sum is not forthcoming, this is evidence that a company is insolvent. In Cornhill Insurance plc v Improvement Services Ltd a small business was owed money, the debt undisputed, by Cornhill Insurance. The solicitors had repeatedly requested payment, but none had come. They presented a winding up petition in the Chancery Court for the company. Cornhill Insurance's solicitors rushed to get an injunction, arguing that there was no evidence at all that their multi-million business had any financial difficulties. Harman J refused to continue the injunction noting that, if the insurance company had [...] "chosen" [...] not to pay, a creditor was also entitled to choose to present a winding up petition when a debt is undisputed on substantial grounds.|$|E
60|$|He realised, somehow, that at {{this terrible}} passive game of fixed tension she would beat him.

A life-automatism of fixed tension that suddenly, in him, did break. His will flew loose in a recoil: a recoil away from her. He left her, as inevitably as a broken spring flies out from its hold.|$|E

6000|$|At {{home all}} were {{watching}} for him. They ran up in anxiety, {{for one of}} the ever ready messengers of evil had rushed down the glen to tell Patience that the soldiers were beating Stead shamefully, and Jeph standing by not saying one word. Little Ben broke out with [...] "Poor, poor!" [...] and Rusha burst into tears at sight of the blood, while Emlyn said [...] "Just what comes of going among the rascal Roundheads," [...] and Patience looked up at him and said [...] "Was it--?" [...] he nodded, and she quietly said [...] "I'm glad." [...] He added, [...] "Jeph's coming soon," [...] and she knew that the trial was not over. The brother and sister needed very few words to understand one another, and they were afraid to say anything that the younger ones could understand. Patience washed the weals with warm water and milk, and wrapped a cloak round him, but even the next morning, he could not use his arms without fresh bleeding, and the hindrance to the work was serious. He could do nothing but herd the cattle, and he was much inclined to drive them to the further end of the moorland where Jephthah would hardly find him, but then he recollected that Patience would be left to bear the brunt of the attack, so that he would not go far off, never guessing, poor fellow, that in his dull, almost blundering fashion, he was doing like the heroes and the martyrs, but only feeling that he must keep his trust at all costs. Jeph, however, did not come that day or the next, so that inwardly, the <b>wound-up</b> feeling had passed into a weariness of expectation, and outwardly the stripes had healed enough for Stead to go about his work as usual only a little stiffly. He went into Bristol on market day as usual, and then it was, on his way out that Jeph joined him, saying it was to bid Patience and the little ones farewell, since the marching orders were for the morrow. He was unusually kind and good-natured; he had a load of comfits for Rusha and Ben, and a stout piece of woollen stuff for Patience which he said was such as he was told godly maidens wore, and which possibly the terror of his steel cap and corslet had cheapened at the mercer's; also he had a large packet of tractates for Stead's own reading, and he enquired whether they possessed a Bible.|$|E
