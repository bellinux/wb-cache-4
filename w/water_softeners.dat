5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in <b>water</b> <b>softeners,</b> salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

2500|$|The boiler {{feedwater}} used in {{the steam}} boiler {{is a means of}} transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning steam turbine. The total feed water consists of recirculated [...] condensate water and purified makeup water. Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to corrosion at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of <b>water</b> <b>softeners</b> and ion exchange demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical insulator, with conductivity in the range of 0.3–1.0 microsiemens per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500MWe plant amounts to perhaps 120 US gallons per minute (7.6 L/s) to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management, and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system.|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{from the}} laundry is {{one source of}} {{greywater}} which is regarded as potentially suitable for reuse. In order to provide {{more information about the}} constituents of laundry waste water in Saudi Arabia, tests were carried out on 50 samples representing the various types of detergent marketed in Saudi Arabia. The laundry water from an equivalent of complete laundry cycle from washing machine was sampled and tested. Overall, the results show high variability in laundry water quality as it is affected by the type of detergents used. Despite of this variation, the results show a remarkable similarity in the range of values for various chemical analysis in other types of laundry water. The laundry water associated with powder detergents was subject to higher levels of pH, EC, SAR and Na than those associated with liquid detergents. A comparison of laundry water quality obtained in this project with the water quality recommended for irrigation guidelines showed that chemical parameters, such as pH, Na and EC reached unacceptably high levels in some powder detergents at which the irrigation with laundry water could pose a potential hazard to trees, soils and groundwater. Some other parameters such as boron, Pb and Zn content in some cases also exceeded the recommended limits mentioned in the irrigation guidelines. Therefore, direct laundry water reuse for garden irrigation needs to be approached with some care and that specific irrigation practices or treatment methods might be required to overcome problems associated with the elevated levels of these quality parameters. The levels of total dissolved salts estimated from EC and SAR values in laundry <b>water</b> from fabric <b>softeners</b> and bleachers were found to be quite reasonable with the quality requirement for irrigatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{additives}} and contaminants which {{occur in}} textile fibers vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of fiber and the pretreatment which it has received. Synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester contain trace amounts of contaminants such as catalysts and catalyst deactivators which remain after the synthesis of the basic polymers. In addition, there are frequently a number of materials which are added to perform specific functions in almost all man-made fibers. Examples of these would include traces of metals or metal salts used as tracers for identification of specific lots of fiber, TiO 2 or similar materials added as delustrants, and a host of organic species added for such special purposes as antistatic agents or flame retardants. There may also be considerable quantities of residual monomer or small oligomers dissolved in the polymer matrix. The situation becomes even more complex after the fibers are converted into fabric form. Numerous materials are applied at various stages of fabric preparation to act as lubricants, sizing agents, antistats, bleaches, and wetting agents to facilitate the processing, but these are normally removed before the fabric reaches the cutters of the ultimate consumers and therefore usually do not constitute potential hazards. However, there are many other chemical agents which are frequently added during the later stages of fabric preparation and which are not designed to be removed. Aside from dyes and printing pigments, the most common additive for apparel fabrics is a durable press treatment. This generally involves the use of materials capable of crosslinking cellulosics by reacting through such functions as N-methylolated amides or related compounds such as ureas and carbamates. These materials pose some potential hazards due to both the nitrogenous bases and the formaldehyde which they usually release. There is usually also some residual catalyst in fabrics which have received such treatments. Other types of chemical treatments which are often applied to fabrics to achieve special effects include flame retardants, soil release agents, antistatic agents, <b>softeners,</b> <b>water</b> and/or oil repellents, ultraviolet absorbers, bacteriostats, and fungistats...|$|R

50|$|High {{levels of}} total {{dissolved}} solids do not correlate to hard water, as <b>water</b> <b>softeners</b> do not reduce TDS. <b>Water</b> <b>softeners</b> remove magnesium and calcium ions, which cause hard water, but these ions are replaced with an equal charge of sodium or potassium ions, e.g. Ca2+ ⇌ 2 Na+.

50|$|Some {{bath salts}} such as {{phosphates}} have a detergent action that softens calloused skin and aids in exfoliation (cleaning off dead skin cells).

5000|$|Magnetic <b>water</b> <b>softeners</b> {{claim that}} their {{magnetic}} fields can help remove scale from {{the washing machine}} and pipes, and prevent new limescale from adhering. Some companies claim to remove hardness ions from hard water, or to precipitate the molecules in the water so they won't [...] "stick" [...] to the pipes, or to reduce the surface tension of water. The claims are dubious, the scientific basis is unclear, the working mechanism is vaguely defined and understudied, and high-quality studies report negative results.

50|$|Builders (also called {{complexation}} or sequestering agents) are <b>water</b> <b>softeners.</b> The {{calcium and}} magnesium ions present {{in hard water}} can cause many detergents to form soap scum, which is ineffective for cleaning.

50|$|An {{ion-exchange resin}} such as chelex 100, which {{contains}} chelating ligands bound to a polymer, {{can be used}} in <b>water</b> <b>softeners</b> and in chromatographic separation techniques. In solvent extraction the formation of electrically-neutral complexes allows cations to be extracted into organic solvents. For example, in nuclear fuel reprocessing uranium(VI) and plutonium(VI) are extracted into kerosene as the complexes MO2(TBP)2(NO3)2 (TBP = tri-n-butyl phosphate). In phase-transfer catalysis, a substance which is insoluble in an organic solvent can be made soluble by addition of a suitable ligand. For example, potassium permanganate oxidations can be achieved by adding a catalytic quantity of a crown ether and a small amount of organic solvent to the aqueous reaction mixture, so that the oxidation reaction occurs in the organic phase.|$|E

While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Examples are remediation of calcium scaling and remediation of salt crusts in soil. These systems do not fall within the term [...] "water softening" [...] but rather [...] "water conditioning".|$|E
