5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

25|$|While many {{researchers}} believe that bee dances give enough information to locate resources, proponents of the odor plume theory argue that the dance gives little, or no actual guidance to a nectar source. They argue that bees instead are primarily recruited by odor. The purpose of the dance is simply to gain attention to the returning <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> so she can share the odor of the nectar with other workers who will then follow the odor trail to the source. Most scientists agree that odor is used in recruitment to resources, but they differ strongly in opinion as to the information content of the dance.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are favorable for swarming, the queen will start laying eggs in queen cups. A virgin queen will develop from a fertilized egg. The young queen larva develops differently {{because it is}} more heavily fed royal jelly, a protein-rich secretion from glands on the heads of young workers. If not for being heavily fed royal jelly, the queen larva would have developed into a regular <b>worker</b> <b>bee.</b> All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed on it exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, a bee {{does not}} {{experience}} diminishing returns because of nectar depletion {{or any other}} characteristic of the flowers themselves. In fact, {{the total amount of}} nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a <b>worker</b> <b>bee,</b> the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.|$|E

40|$|Chronic bee {{paralysis}} virus (CBPV) {{is known as}} a disease of <b>worker</b> honey <b>bees.</b> To investigate pathogenesis of the CBPV on the queen, the sole reproductive individual in a colony, we conducted experiments regarding the susceptibility of queens to CBPV.

2500|$|A {{dominant}} {{theory of}} explaining the self-organized {{division of labor}} in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model. [...] It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks. [...] Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task. [...] Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> encounters. [...] The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers. [...] This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{in a cell}} in a wax honeycomb, {{produced}} and shaped by the <b>worker</b> <b>bees.</b> Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on into which cell she is laying. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and <b>worker</b> <b>bees)</b> develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by <b>worker</b> <b>bees,</b> later switching to honey and pollen.

50|$|In {{most common}} bee species, worker bees are {{infertile}} due to enforced altruistic kin selection, and thus never reproduce.

Genetically, a <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> does {{not differ from}} a queen bee and can even become a laying <b>worker</b> <b>bee,</b> but in most species will produce only male (drone) offspring.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{method of}} communication is the waggle dance, performed primarily when a <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> discovers {{a rich source}} of pollen or nectar and wishes to share this knowledge with her fellow nest-mates. The waggle dance occurs deep inside the colony’s hive, where the <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> performs a brief reenactment of the recent journey to a patch of flowers. Neighboring bees observe and learn this dance and can then follow the same pattern, utilizing the odor of the flowers to fly in a certain path and arrive at the same destination. The bees following the informed <b>worker</b> <b>bee</b> will extend their antennae towards the dancer in order to detect the dance sounds, as the frequency of the bee’s antennae closely matches the vibration frequency of its wings. The overall direction and duration of each waggle is closely correlated with the direction and distance from the flower patch being described.|$|E
