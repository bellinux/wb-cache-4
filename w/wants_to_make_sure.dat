Achilles <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that this does not happen again.

5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Speak Now", Swift narrates about {{crashing}} her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back. The opening lines acknowledge that, although out of character, Swift is {{still in love with}} her ex-boyfriend and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> he does not marry the wrong girl. Throughout the song's verses, Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations, such as the bride-to-be's bearing of a poofy wedding gown, her cumulative family, and an organist playing [...] "Bridal Chorus". In [...] "Speak Now"'s refrains, Swift pleads her ex-boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her. The bridge has Swift responding to the priest's calling of [...] "Speak now or forever hold your peace" [...] before repeating the opening lines. The last refrain is altered, with Swift narrating from the groom's perspective and inform Swift they will indeed run away together.|$|E
500|$|After {{his girlfriend}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) sues her former {{employer}} Dunder Mifflin for wrongful termination, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself forced by Jan to {{be a witness}} against his employer. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Michael will not say anything to harm Dunder Mifflin even though Michael is Jan's boyfriend. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence {{that she had a}} romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend." [...] Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day.|$|E

Sephy is not alarmed and does not protest, but Minerva panics. Sephy tells Jude that he would be doing her a favour by killing her and wants to die because she misses Callum. When Minerva tries to change her mind, Sephy declares that she hates the baby because it was alive and that Callum should be alive instead. (That is a lie, and Sephy later threatens to kill Jude if he ever hurts her child.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... (In)famous for its terseness, ed gives {{almost no}} visual feedback, {{and has been}} called (by Peter H. Salus) [...] "the most user-hostile editor ever created", even when {{compared}} to the contemporary (and notoriously complex) TECO. For example, the message that ed will produce in case of error, or when it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the user wishes to quit without saving, is [...] "?". [...] It does not report the current filename or line number, or even display the results of a change to the text, unless requested. Older versions (ca. 1981) did not even ask for confirmation when a quit command was issued without the user saving changes. This terseness was appropriate in the early versions of Unix, when consoles were teletypes, modems were slow, and memory was precious. As computer technology improved and these constraints were loosened, editors with more visual feedback became the norm.|$|E

[...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury.

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.|$|E

When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, [...] "She always told me she wanted to have her kids with me." [...] Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith [...] "always told me I want you to be there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because I took care of Anna with her health and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy.

2500|$|Albee’s {{directing}} {{almost every}} line of dialogue demonstrates {{that he has}} very specific psychological meanings behind his words. He {{is aware of the}} characters’ thoughts and the emotions behind their words and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the actors understand them. He is not willing to allow the actors to interpret the play on their own. He uses terms like “quiet despair”, “surprised delight”, “slight schoolteacher tone”, and “the way a nurse speaks to a disturbed patient”. [...] He often writes directions about how the actors should hold their hands, turn their heads, or change their facial expressions to include a narrowing of their eyes. The longest script notation that Albee writes occurs toward the end of act 3, before a monologue delivered by the character Tobias. Albee’s directions read: [...] "This next is an aria. It must have in its performance all the horror and exuberance {{of a man who has}} kept his emotions under control too long. Tobias will be carried to the edge of hysteria, and he will find himself laughing, sometimes, while he cries from sheer release. All in all, it is genuine and bravura at the same time, one prolonging the other. I shall try to notate it somewhat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E

[...] However, shortly afterwards, Rose told MTV News [...] "You'll see , but I don't know if 'soon' is the word". Dizzy Reed mentioned in November 2002 that the album [...] "should be in stores by June (2003)" [...] and stating there were only [...] "a few odds and ends left to do, a couple of finishing touches, a couple of vocals – {{and we need to}} mix it." [...] Rose also confirmed the plans for multiple albums and stated that a part of the delay was due to lack of support from the label to older bands, saying, [...] "I've had to do way more jobs in it than I'm supposed to. I've had to be manager, A man, producer, sole lyric writer, {{and a lot of other}} things." [...] An editor from antiMUSIC claimed Rose told him in an informal chat in June 2003 that [...] "he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it is a perfect as possible before it is released". In mid-2003, the band reportedly started the process of re-recording the album again. Shortly after Buckethead left the band in March 2004, Rose {{released a}} statement saying, [...] "Guns will be moving forward, we hope to announce a release date within the next few months."
