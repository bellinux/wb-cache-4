50|$|A patient needing {{specialist}} care at {{a hospital}} or clinic, will be informed by the GP of the hospitals {{where they can get}} their treatment. This choice usually includes public and private hospitals. The NHS will pay for treatment in a private setting if the hospital meets the cost and service criteria that NHS hospitals adhere to. Otherwise opting for a private hospital makes the patient liable for private hospital fees. Because the private sector often has higher costs, most people choose to be treated for free in an NHS hospital. If the GP judges the case to be extremely urgent, the doctor may by-pass the normal booking system and arrange an emergency admission. The median wait time for a consultant led first appointment in English hospitals is a little over 3 weeks. Patients can be seen by the hospital as out-patients or in-patients, with the latter involving overnight stay. The speed of in-patient admission is based on medical need and time waiting with more urgent cases faster though all cases will be dealt with eventually. Only about one third of hospital admissions are from a waiting list. For those not admitted immediately, the median wait time for in-patient treatment in English hospitals is a little under 6 weeks. Trusts are working towards an 18-week guarantee that means that the hospital must complete all tests and start treatment within 18 weeks of the date of the referral from the GP.

Idiosyncrasies in reading and/or writing bioinformatics file formats can halt or impair <b>analysis</b> <b>workflows</b> by in-terfering with the transfer of data from one informatics tools to another. Fasta-O-Matic automates handling of common but minor format issues that otherwise may halt pipelines. The need for automation must be balanced by the need for manual confirmation that any formatting error is actually minor rather than indicative of a corrupt data file. To that end Fasta-O-Matic reports any issues detected to the user with optionally color coded and quiet or verbose logs. Fasta-O-Matic can be used as a general pre-processing tool in bioin-formatics workflows (e. g. to automatically wrap FASTA files so that they can be read by BioPerl).

The framework needs two kinds of algorithms- One is for generating the total se-quences of the control-paths from a workflow model, {{and the other is}} for rediscovering the runtime enactment his-tory of each control-path out of the total sequences from the corresponding workflow’s execution logs.

40|$|<b>Workflow</b> <b>analysis</b> is an {{important}} component in the simulation of construction operations. It involves creating a specific number of work requests for a crew every time period, computing outputs such as work arrival rate for a downstream crew and plotting work in process (WIP). These outputs are not directly provided in many construction simulation software tools. Determining these outputs is generally considered a time consuming and tedious undertaking. Developing modeling constructs that automate the computation of these workflow outputs will be useful for construction modelers. This paper presents a special purpose simulation (SPS) template developed for <b>workflow</b> <b>analysis.</b> The SPS template consists of four modeling constructs that implement the <b>workflow</b> <b>analysis</b> functionalities mentioned above. The SPS template logic was verified using two simulation experiments. Use of this SPS template for analyzing different workflow based issues as well as to test the production management principles in construction is also highlighted. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{on the process}} concept puts forth the need for {{consistent}} methods and techniques for the capture, representation and performance assessment of business processes. In addition, Information Process Reengineering (IPR), i. e., the analysis of how to use legacy and new information systems to automate and support the reengineered business processes, requires the development of information process models, that are consistent, transparent and coherent with the business process models. Although the object-oriented approach {{seems to be the}} most suitable for a common process modelling scheme, it lacks significant attributes that would model the specificities of the business domain.

40|$|Abstract—Workflow {{security}} {{has become increasingly}} important and challenging in today’s open service world. While much {{research has been conducted}} on various security issues of workflow systems, the workflow satisfiability problem, which asks whether a set of users together can complete a workflow, is recently identified as an important research problem that needs more investigation. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of the problem along two directions: one is by considering either one path or all paths of a workflow, and the other is by considering the possible patterns in a workflow. We have shown that the general <b>workflow</b> satisfiability <b>analysis</b> problem is intractable. This result motivates us to consider restrictions on workflow control-flow patterns and access control policies, and to identify tractable cases of practical interest.

40|$|Abstract. Geoscience {{analysis}} is currently limited by cumbersome access and manipulation of large datasets from remote sources. Due to their data-heavy and compute-light nature, these analysis workloads represent {{a class of}} applications unsuited to a computational grid optimized for compute-intensive applications. We present the Script <b>Workflow</b> <b>Analysis</b> for MultiProcessing (SWAMP) system, which relocates data-intensive workflows from scientists ’ workstations to the hosting datacenters {{in order to reduce}} data transfer and exploit locality. Our colocation of computation and data leverages the typically reductive characteristics of these workflows, allowing SWAMP to complete workflows in a fraction of the time and with much less data transfer. We describe SWAMP’s implementation and interface, which is designed to leverage scientists ’ existing script-based workflows. Tests with a production geoscience workflow show drastic improvements not only in overall execution time, but in computation time as well. SWAMP’s <b>workflow</b> <b>analysis</b> capability allows it to detect dependencies, optimize I/O, and dynamically parallelize execution. Benchmarks quantify the drastic reduction in transfer time, computation time, and end-to-end execution time. ...|$|E
