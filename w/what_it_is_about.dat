5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about.</b> Brian suggests she {{read it and}} tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

The following list contains some works that are not autobiographies, but rather essays on mathematics and mathematicians with strong autobiographical elements.|$|E
500|$|You {{can hear}} (and I am sure most Beatles fans have) [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] {{a lot and}} not know really <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about.</b> Basically it is saying what {{meditation}} is all about. The goal of meditation is to go beyond (that is, transcend) waking, sleeping and dreaming. So the song starts out by saying, [...] "Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream, it is not dying." ...|$|E

500|$|Gene Siskel {{described}} it as the [...] "finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986." [...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about),</b> but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating {{a sense of the}} geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E
500|$|Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict {{gave the}} episode a grade of A+ and commented that it {{features}} {{one of the}} best musical numbers in the show's [...] "history of great musical numbers". Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the best episode of the season, and added: [...] "I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> this episode — the 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?' song number; James Woods filling in for Apu at the store; or Homer’s wise line 'I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead' — but the entire affair is inspired. [...] It’s in the little details that make this episode the year’s best, and solidifies The Simpsons as the funniest sitcom of all time." [...] AskMen.com ranked [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] as number six on their list of the top ten The Simpsons episodes. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5.|$|E

[...] In promotion of the project, Fiona Reynolds, the Director-General of the National Trust, stated: [...] "We want this day {{to have its own}} place in history and be a snapshot of everyday life {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century." [...] Journalist John Plunkett expressed scepticism of this aim, writing in The Guardian that, despite the intentions of the campaign, it was only going to be [...] "a historical record of people with computers". He was also critical of History Matters in general, saying that he had [...] "no idea how history [...] going to impact on [...] ". Dave Hill, also writing for The Guardian, described the campaign as a [...] "brilliant idea". Following the publication of the diary entries, Robert Booth, a journalist for The Sunday Times, remarked that the [...] "monotony of most of [...] lives was all too painfully obvious." ...|$|E

500|$|Jennifer's Body is the {{follow-up}} to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on Juno. In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It was just so original, so imaginative", she stated. [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> this script and the world is that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as." [...] Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about,</b> this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 Williams {{participated in}} a Jazz at Lincoln Center program titled [...] "Swing Landscapes: Jazz Visualized".

2500|$|Patrick D. Miller in his {{commentary}} on Deuteronomy suggests that {{different views of}} the structure of the book will lead to different views on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about.</b> The structure is often described as a series of three speeches or sermons (chapters 1:1–4:43, 4:44–29:1, 29:2–30:20) followed by a number of short appendices– Miller refers to this as the [...] "literary" [...] structure; alternatively, it is sometimes seen as a ring-structure with a central core (chapters 12–26, the Deuteronomic Code) and an inner and an outer frame (chapters 4–11/27–30 and 1–3/31–34)– Miller calls this the covenantal substructure; and finally the theological structure revealed in the theme of the exclusive worship of Yahweh established in the first of the Ten Commandments ("Thou shalt have no other god before me") and the Shema.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the members}} left Opeth, Mikael Åkerfeldt and David Isberg {{began to write}} the songs. Åkerfeldt commented about: [...] "As you might {{understand}} I {{was more or less}} influenced by the occult back then, although in no serious manner. Music wise I was really into the twisted, dark, and evil-sounding riffs. The lyrics written by both me and David were pure Satanic chantings!" [...] According to Åkerfeldt, [...] "the idea for Opeth was for it to be evil—satanic lyrics and evil riffs. I chose my notes so they sounded evil." [...] The first two songs that Åkerfeldt and Isberg wrote were [...] "Requiem of Lost Souls" [...] and [...] "Mystique of the Baphomet" [...] (later [...] "Mark of the Damned" [...] and later [...] "Forest of October"). When Isberg quit the band, Åkerfeldt and Peter Lindgren [...] "really felt that we had found a real original way of playing. There were at the time almost no other band [...] using that many harmonies as we did." [...] "Forest of October" [...] "is the best song on the album", according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt says he doesn't remember <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about,</b> and that he only remembers that he wrote the lyrics to sound like the music.|$|E
2500|$|Duff herself co-wrote three {{tracks on}} the album: [...] "Mr. James Dean", [...] "Haters" [...] and [...] "Rock This World", {{the first two}} of which, along with [...] "The Last Song", Haylie co-wrote. Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with myself to do that". She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying {{she did not know}} Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and I just felt like it was appropriate." [...] She said she felt [...] "normal girls" [...] could relate to the song because of the [...] "petty stuff" [...] that occurs in schools.|$|E
