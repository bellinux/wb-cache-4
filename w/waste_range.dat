The property characterisation has primarily revealed the following aspects: potential influence on moisture content of local weather conditions at outdoor wood waste storage sites; generally, higher ash contents in ‘‘engineered” wood wastes as compared with ‘‘raw” wood wastes; and relatively high energy content values of ‘‘engineered” wood <b>wastes</b> (<b>ranging</b> on the whole from 3675 to 5105 kcal/kg for HHV, and from 3304 to 4634 kcal/kg for LHV). The smoke qualitative analysis of non-controlled lab-scale burning tests has primarily revealed: the presence of specific organic compounds indicative of incomplete wood combustion; the presence exclusively in ‘‘engineered” wood burning tests of pyrroles and amines, {{as well as the}} additional presence (as compared with ‘‘raw” wood burning) of further phenolic and containing nitrogen compounds; and the potential environmental impact of incomplete industrial wood burning on the photochemical smog phenomenon. Finally, non-controlled pilot-scale burning tests have primarily given the following findings: emission presence of carbon monoxide indicative of incomplete wood combustion; higher nitrogen oxide emission values detected in ‘‘engineered” wood burning tests as compared with ‘‘raw” wood burning test; and considerable generation of the respirable PM 1 fraction during incomplete industrial wood burning...|$|R
30|$|Various {{studies have}} shown the {{applicability}} of Fenton’s reagent to treat a variety of industrial <b>wastes</b> containing a <b>range</b> of organic compounds like phenols, formaldehyde, pesticides, wood preservatives, plastic additives, and rubber chemicals. The process may also be applied to wastewaters, sludge, and contaminated soils to reduce the toxicity (Zhou and Smith 2002; Titus et al. 2004; Chiro et al. 1999).|$|R
40|$|The {{quantities}} of waste {{generated by the}} healthcare sector in the United Kingdom (UK) {{have been shown to}} be amongst the highest in Europe. Based on a case study undertaken within the Cornwall NHS (National Health Service) in the UK, this paper reports on the results of waste minimisation trials. The schemes were able to achieve significant waste reductions in both clinical and domestic waste quantities. Indeed, a reduction in domestic bag <b>waste</b> in the <b>range</b> of 1. 6 - 33. 4 %, with an average of 14. 8 % was realised. For clinical <b>waste,</b> the reduction <b>ranged</b> from 1. 8 % to 38. 3 %, at an average of 15. 7 %, with net cost benefits of nearly US$ 25, 000 over the period of 1 - 3 years. The outcomes suggest that significant resource and financial efficiencies can be attained, but due to the many factors involved, there is a need to focus both on containment and logistics, as well as social factors for success...|$|R
40|$|Pilot {{research}} was conducted {{by a team of}} students in the Politics of Food class at the University of Pennsylvania, with the aim to characterize the different streams of food waste arising from a single dining hall on the university campus. There is little available information about food waste streams at this level of detail. This study builds on the work of a previous group of students, who developed a proposal for an institutionalized food recovery program that Penn Dining and Bon Appétit Management Corporation agreed to put to trial in a single dining hall for the 2014 - 2015 academic year. The present team continues to collaborate with Penn Dining and Bon Appétit, with the goal of identifying food waste streams comprising the total waste from an all-you-can-eat style dining facility. This site offers an ideal context, as the dining hall closes between each meal service, thereby allowing for more accurate data collection and reduced interference with kitchen operations. Food waste streams were measured from a single meal period (dinner) over the course of 10 days (weekdays of two weeks), including: unavoidable (kitchen trims during food preparation), recoverable (cooked but not served), non-recoverable (service station remains), and plate waste (dumped by individual dinners). Daily plate <b>waste</b> <b>ranged</b> from 110 - 167 lbs, with a mean of 138 lbs and a standard deviation of 21 lbs; whereas the other three food waste streams (unavoidable, recoverable, and non-recoverable) averaged between 13 - 17 lbs each. On a percentage basis, plate waste accounted for 76...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of precipitation and age of waste on the stabilization of the dumped waste. Landfill gas samples at 1 -m depth were collected from 13 waste landfill sites in Sri Lanka with different annual precipitation ranging from 1, 000 to 4, 000 mm and <b>waste</b> age <b>ranging</b> from 1 to 120 months. Typical landfill gases O 2, N 2, CH 4 and CO 2 were measured quantitatively by a gas chromatograph. Buried waste samples at 1 -m depth were also taken from all locations to determine organic carbon contents in the residue (< 2 mm). With the age of wastes, the measured O 2 and N 2 concentration (ranged in 1 - 20 % and 2 - 80 % respectively) in collected landfill gas samples were increased and the CH 4 and CO 2 concentration (ranged in 0 - 60 % and 1 - 68 %, respectively) decreased, implying the buried wastes are getting stabilized within 120 months after dumped (typically in several decades in mid-latitude regions). However, the correlations between measured gas concentrations and the annual precipitations at the sampling site show no definite results. Organic carbon contents in the <b>waste</b> residues (<b>ranged</b> in 24 - 236 mg g- 1) were not fully related to the waste age and the precipitation amount, while significant time-dependent decreases of the organic carbon contents can be observed in some investigated landfill sites. Further studies are needed with continuous monitoring of rainfall with gas emission...|$|R
