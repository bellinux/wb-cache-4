25|$|European seiners {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} located {{more to the}} after part of the vessel with the <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> amidships. European seiners are most common in waters fished by European nations. The net is stowed in a net bin at the stern, and is set over the stern from this position. The pursing winch is normally positioned at the forward part of the <b>working</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{superstructure}} is {{forward or}} midships and the <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps {{to empty the}} codend.|$|E
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} with aft superstructure and midship <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> {{are usually}} beam trawlers (see below). These use large beams to rig the trawls.|$|E
50|$|Nomadic is {{of steel}} construction, with steel frames, beams, {{bulkheads}} and riveted hull plating. She had four <b>working</b> <b>decks</b> with various hold spaces beneath. She could carry up to 1,000 passengers when fully loaded.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{have large}} <b>working</b> <b>decks</b> {{to allow the}} vessels to cope in several roles, such as {{disaster}} relief, fire fighting, rescue work, and interception of other vessels. For this purpose a crane capable of lifting 25 tonnes is fitted, to enable standard containers to be used. The deck is also large enough to permit the transport of other craft such as oil spill recovery tractors and landing craft.|$|R
50|$|During both World Wars, many fishing {{trawlers}} {{were commissioned}} as naval trawlers. Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements {{because they were}} robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear <b>working</b> <b>decks.</b> One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep. Adding depth charge racks on the deck, ASDIC below, and a 3 in or 4 in gun in the bows equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties.|$|R
25|$|Anchor seiners {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} and accommodation aft and the <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and {{shot from the}} stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships.|$|E
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} with {{a forward}} superstructure and aft <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> {{are widely used}} to target shrimp. The towing winch is usually located {{to the rear of}} the superstructure so warps from the drums feed to bollards on the cap rail, and then to towing blocks on the outriggers.|$|E
25|$|Asian seiners – In Asia, {{the seine}} netter usually has the {{wheelhouse}} forward and the <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> aft, {{in the manner}} of a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour-intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} fuel-coolant interaction (IFCI) {{computer code}} {{is being developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories to investigate the fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) problem at large scale using a two-dimensional, three-field hydrodynamic framework and physically based models. IFCI will be capable of treating all major FCI processes in an integrated manner. This document is a description of IFCI 7. 0. The user's manual describes the hydrodynamic method and physical models used in IFCI 7. 0. Appendix A is an input manual provided {{for the creation of}} <b>working</b> <b>decks...</b>|$|R
50|$|A naval trawler is {{a vessel}} built {{along the lines}} of a fishing trawler but fitted out for naval purposes. Naval {{trawlers}} were widely used during the First and Second World Wars. Fishing trawlers were particularly suited for many naval requirements because they were robust boats designed to work heavy trawls in all types of weather and had large clear <b>working</b> <b>decks.</b> One could create a mine sweeper simply by replacing the trawl with a mine sweep. Adding depth charge racks on the deck, ASDIC below, and a 3 in or 4 in gun in the bow equipped the trawler for anti-submarine duties.|$|R

25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E
25|$|Sause Bros. {{opened a}} shipyard, Southern Oregon Marine (SOMAR), in 1979, east of Coos Bay, Oregon. The SOMAR {{division}} of Sause Bros. constructs, modifies, repairs, and maintains the company's fleet of tugs and barges, including line-haul and ship-assist tugs, lumber barges, covered house barges, and double hull liquid cargo barges. During the mid-'70s, Sause Bros. had two single-screw 104ft (32m) tugs, the Joseph Sause and the Henry Sause, built in Louisiana. Over the years, SOMAR has lengthened these two tugs, increased the beam, and added new engines and twin screws {{to gain more}} <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> space fore and aft. These changes also made possible a larger pilot house, located {{near the center of}} the boat.|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{changes to}} the ship were made in {{converting}} her to a seaplane tender, with the superstructure, funnel, and propulsion machinery moved aft and a <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> occupying the forward half of the ship. The deck was not intended as a flying-off deck, but for starting and running up of seaplane engines and for recovering damaged aircraft from the sea. The ship was equipped with a large aircraft hold, [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high along with extensive workshops. Two [...] steam cranes {{on the sides of}} the forecastle lifted the aircraft through the sliding hatch of the hangar onto the flight deck or into the water. She carried [...] of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial [...] tins.|$|E
50|$|His {{early work}} was an {{imitation}} of what he produced while <b>working</b> for <b>Deck,</b> but by the 1890s, Lachenal's work showed the influences of the trends and fashions {{of the late nineteenth}} century: Japanese prints, the shift from faience pottery to grès, and the emergence of Art Nouveau.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Jefferson is {{designed}} to collect hydrographic data from depths of between 10 meters (33 feet) and 4,000 meters (13,123 feet). She has 700 sq ft of laboratory space and 2300 sq ft of scientific storage space. She carries Global Positioning System and Loran-C receivers and a computerized data-collection system. She has a roll stabilization tank and a collision avoidance system.Thomas Jefferson has 1500 sq ft of <b>deck</b> <b>working</b> space. Her <b>deck</b> equipment features two winches; two fixed, telescopic, 7-ton-capacity cranes; and a C-frame.|$|R
2500|$|The {{boatswain}} {{works in}} a ship's deck department as the foreman of the unlicensed (crew members without a mate's licence) deck crew. [...] Sometimes, the boatswain is also a third or fourth mate. A bosun must be highly skilled in all matters of marlinespike seamanship required for <b>working</b> on <b>deck</b> of a seagoing vessel. The bosun is distinguished from other able seamen by the supervisory roles: planning, scheduling, and assigning work.|$|R
2500|$|Gordon Gunter has {{demonstrated}} mission flexibility through {{her ability to}} undergo quick reconfiguration. On one occasion, her after <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> was reconfigured to deploy a weather buoy about [...] off the Louisiana coast. [...] This mission helped fill a critical data gap in weather information that commercial fishermen, the petroleum industry, and recreational boaters rely upon heavily.|$|E
2500|$|Stern {{trawlers}} have trawls {{which are}} deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers {{often have a}} ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft <b>working</b> <b>deck.</b> At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards.|$|E
2500|$|American seiners {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} placed {{forward with the}} <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> aft. American seiners are most common on both coasts of North America and {{in other areas of}} Oceania. The net is stowed at the stern and is set over the stern. The power block is usually attached to a boom from a mast located behind the superstructure. American seiners use Triplerollers. [...] A purse line winch is located amidships near the hauling station, near the side where the rings are taken on board.|$|E
5000|$|Lafrance {{describes}} himself as easily bored and a [...] "counter-culture guy". He says his philosophy around decking comes from a war vet friend who told him decks were places of rest in a crazy world. Lafrance struggled in school, ultimately dropping out, and was told {{to go into the}} trades. He is known for being energetic and at one point was <b>working</b> on <b>Decked</b> Out and Deck Wars while developing Disaster Deck.|$|R

2500|$|Although the 6,000-ton Ilya Muromets is {{the largest}} {{icebreaker}} ever built for the Russian Navy, she is somewhat smaller than the civilian icebreakers operated by Atomflot, Rosmorport and Sovcomflot. In terms of size and general layout, the [...] vessel {{is comparable to the}} civilian Project MPSV06 multi-purpose salvage vessels with a <b>working</b> <b>deck</b> aft, deckhouse amidships and a helideck rated for Kamov Ka-27 helicopter. Like her civilian counterparts, Ilya Muromets is also equipped with a towing winch and stern notch for escorting other ships in ice conditions. She is served by a crew of 32 but can carry up to 50 marines in full combat gear.|$|E

50|$|Her {{companion}} {{book for}} The Witches Tarot includes meditations {{and methods of}} <b>working</b> with the <b>deck,</b> {{as well as a}} new way of reading Tarot, and a complete description of The Witches Tarot deck. Both the deck and the book are noteworthy for being the first to combine the Qabalistic symbolism and elements drawn from Wicca, in a way that speaks to Pagans.|$|R
50|$|Jacklines may be rigged {{temporarily}} when {{bad weather}} is expected, or, especially on sailboats heading offshore, {{they may be}} left in place {{all the time and}} used as necessary. They are usually attached to strong padeye or cleat fittings {{at both ends of the}} boat, allowing the crewmember to move fore and aft by sliding their harness clip along the line. Jacklines may be made of wire or low-stretch rope. More recently, sailors are using high strength nylon webbing. The reason is that flat webbing does not roll under foot while <b>working</b> on <b>deck</b> and there is less chance to confuse it with other lines in difficult conditions. This reduces the hazard that can be created by using rope.|$|R
40|$|After-treatment {{technologies}} are adopted in automobiles and ships to meet strict emission regulations, which increase exhaust back pressure. Furthermore, underwater exhaust systems are employed on board ships to save space, and reduce noise and pollution on <b>working</b> <b>decks.</b> However, water at exhaust outlet creates a flow resistance for the exhaust gases, which {{adds to the}} back pressure. High back pressure reduces the operating limits of an engine, increases fuel consumption, {{and can lead to}} exhaust smoke. While the effects of back pressure were recognized earlier, {{there is a lack of}} experimentally validated research on the performance limits of a turbocharged, marine diesel engine against high back pressure for the entire operating window. The focus of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of back pressure effects on marine diesel engine performance, and to identify limits of acceptable back pressure along with methods to tackle high back pressure. In this work, a pulse turbocharged, medium speed, diesel engine was tested at different loads and engine speeds; against different values of static back pressure. Additionally, mean value model simulations could be validated and were used to compare the performance of a pulse and constant pressure turbocharged engine against high back pressures of 1  meter water-column (mWC), and for two different values of valve overlap. Using the validated simulation model, the conceptual basis for the engine smoke limit as well as for thermal overloading is investigated. A methodology applying the conceptual basis to define boundaries of acceptable back pressures has been presented in this paper. A combination of pulse turbocharger systems and small valve overlap showed to significantly improve back pressure handling capabilities of engines. </p...|$|R

40|$|Falling {{overboard}} is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} among commercial fishermen nationwide. Of the 182 fishermen who died from falls overboard between 2000 and 2011 NONE of them were wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). Researchers from the NIOSH Alaska Pacific Office conducted an evaluation with commercial fishermen from 4 gear groups to rate the comfort and acceptability of six modern personal flotation devices (PFDs). About 200 fishermen were asked to evaluate a PFD for one month while <b>working</b> on <b>deck</b> so that wearable PFDs could be identified. This document is a supplement to the gear-specific fact sheets we have also published and has guidance for selecting a PFD that will work for you. November 2012.

50|$|Although both Swale and {{her husband}} were able to sail and had {{prepared}} as well as they could, the trip had its risks, and it nearly ended in disaster 3 times: when Rosie fell overboard in the Caribbean 900 mi from the closest land; again when she needed emergency medical treatment in hospital; and a third time when the whole family suffered arsenic poisoning from a meal of unsoaked beans. The hardships were survived, however, and the voyage was a significant navigational achievement, using only an old Spitfire compass, nautical charts and a sextant, in the days before GPS. By the time the family finally returned to Plymouth, Rosie had not only completed her first book, Rosie Darling (often <b>working</b> below <b>decks</b> on her typewriter for up to six hours at a time), but had also written her second book, Children of Cape Horn.|$|R
