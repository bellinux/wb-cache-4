However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E

For the nonuniform function classes NPMV/poly, NPSV/poly, and NPMVt/poly, we show the following lowness results: Sets whose characteristic functions are in NPSV/poly and that have program checkers <b>are</b> <b>low</b> for AM and ZPPNP.

5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success <b>was</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
