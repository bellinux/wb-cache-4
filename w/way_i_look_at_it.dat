500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, New York Post sports {{reporter}} Justin Terranova {{wrote that}} the butt fumble [...] "has come to define Sanchez’s downfall with the Jets." [...] Terranova {{wrote that the}} play had unfairly overshadowed Sanchez's AFC Championship campaigns in the previous two seasons, as well as Moore's [...] "ten years manning a generally-solid Jets offensive line." [...] When Moore retired in 2013, he reflected on the play, [...] "It's amusing to me that people think it's so amusing. The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I don't think it should have any link to my career. I don't think it stands for what I was as a player for 10 years. I really don't give it much thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, she {{released}} her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She {{said of the}} album, [...] "people could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> ... people will like your next album if it's a suck-ass one." [...] As with Alanis (1991), Now Is the Time (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"An Emotion Away", the minor adult contemporary hit [...] "No Apologies" [...] and [...] "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". It was a commercial failure, however, selling {{only a little more}} than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.|$|E
