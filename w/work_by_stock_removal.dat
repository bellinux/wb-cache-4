40|$|Within this work, {{we focus}} on the {{optimization}} of storage location assignments arising in warehouses with storage locations applying a last-in, first-out throughput policy. The sequence of goods to be stored is, however, not entirely known such that for each item the currently best storage location has to be identified almost immediately. Caused by this imperfect data and <b>by</b> <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> concurrently performed it is necessary to apply relocation operations from time to time, which might range from a few operations to relocations lasting a working day depending on the workload of the warehousemen. For this purpose we propose an ad hoc stocking strategy as well as a storage relocation strategy based on variable neighborhood descent. Supported by experimental tests we compare variants of our approaches {{with each other and with}} formerly used stocking strategies showing that the number of conflicts could be significantly reduced by the proposed approach. Furthermore, an application of the relocation strategy can significantly improve warehouse states obtained due to imperfect stocking strategies, concurrently performed <b>stock</b> <b>removals</b> and insufficient information on production sequences...|$|R

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped <b>by</b> forging or <b>stock</b> <b>removal.</b> Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. <b>Stock</b> <b>removal</b> blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> product lines <b>by</b> the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new methodological {{approach}} to the identification and extraction of an index of the business cycle. The main difference with the previous literature is that the reference cycle is identified as the common transitory component of a multivariate time series, and it is estimated using a structural multivariate approach. The empirical analysis shows that the proposed index substantially replicates the official reference cycle by employing a stochastic model that is both parsimonious and statistically satisfactory. 1. Introduction The recent <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>Stock</b> and Watson (1989, 1991) has reopened the debate about which is the appropriate indicator of the business cycle. Their methodological suggestion is to adopt a probabilistic approach, that sets out explicitly the statistical model upon which the cyclical indicator is based, thereby allowing a formal evaluation of its properties. The identification of a probability model of the business cycle requires a precise and coher [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Emerson's early folding knives {{were of the}} linerlock variety, ground <b>by</b> the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> method, and {{utilized}} rare {{materials from}} the aerospace industry, including titanium, carbon fiber, micarta, and meteorite. [...] He incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time, including mother-of-pearl, abalone shell, paua shell, staghorn, and rare hardwoods. Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker. The steel used in these blades was typically graded ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C, and the blades were either highly polished or hand-rubbed. Emerson made knives with Damascus steel blades. Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are known as the [...] "Pre-Tac" [...] (Pre-Tactical) models. They can be identified by their bright anodized titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades. The knives were noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms. Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along during his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{find that}} the {{interest}} rate term spread predicts real U. S. economic activity. We show that this relationship breaks down for the 1990 s and suggest that its earlier success was due to high and volatile inflation. We find, however, that the high-yield spread (HYS) between “junk bond ” and government bond yields predicts real activity during the 1990 s—especially high levels of the HYS. We also {{find that the}} HYS works through both the demand and the supply side of the economy. We interpret our findings as supportive of a financial accelerator mechanism. [JEL E 33, E 44] The slope of nominal yield curve, or the term spread, was shown by studies published in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s to have significant predictive content for future real economic activity, both in the United States and in Europe. 1 Following the early <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>Stock</b> and Watson (1989) and Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991), 2 however, confidence in the predictive power of the term spread waned a little when it failed to predict the 1990 – 91 U.

Nevertheless, further <b>work</b> <b>by,</b> among others, Estrella and Mishkin (1997) and Plosser and Rouwenhorst (1994) seemed to establish that its power as a leading indicator of real economic activity had not evaporated.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} for making effective use of monthly indicators to develop a current-quarter GDP forecast. Estimates and projections of real GDP growth are usually used to describe how the economy is doing. But estimates of GDP are only available quarterly, and the first GDP estimate for a quarter is released late in the month {{following the end of}} the quarter. The lack of a timely, comprehensive economic picture may mean that policymakers and business planners may be as much as four months behind in recognizing a significant slowdown or acceleration in the economy. This problem is especially important around business cycle peaks or troughs, where there may be some evidence that the economy is changing direction. There are many less-comprehensive, but higher-frequency data series about the economy, however. The chief difficulty with using the multiple indicators is that different indicators can give different signals, and there is no agreed-upon way for aggregating the statistics to give a single-valued answer. In this paper, we describe the approach we have adopted at the Treasury Department to use a broad variety of high-frequency incoming data to construct “realtime” estimates of quarterly real GDP growth. We draw on the recent <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>Stock</b> and Watson and others and describe the indicators, the techniques, and the recent performance of the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy {{control is}} applied to the {{superfinishing}} in order to optimize the cutting ability of the stone. The finishing performance of vitrified bonded WA stone is regarded as the fuzzy goal. At the beginning of cutting, the stone is in the stage of cutting to get high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate. But the cutting ability is decreasing as the finishing proceeds and is lost at the end of finishing, resulting in getting the smooth surface. A cutting resistance is used to monitor the cutting condition of stone. The cutting ability of stone is controlled by both the stone pressure and the amount of electricity for electrolytic in-process dressing. A water-solution type coolant and metal bonded diamond stone are used. The main results obtained are as follows. Fuzzy control makes it possible to give the optimized cutting ability to the diamond stone.
