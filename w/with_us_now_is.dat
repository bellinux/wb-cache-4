The 95th were a rifle regiment, and had dark green coats instead of red. It was strange to see them loading, for they would put the ball into a greasy rag and then hammer it down with a mallet, but they could fire both further and straighter than we. All that part of Belgium was covered with British troops at that time; for the Guards were over near Enghien, and there were cavalry regiments on the further side of us. You see, it was very necessary that Wellington should spread out all his force, for Boney was behind the screen of his fortresses, and of course we had no means of saying on what side he might pop out, except that he was pretty sure to come the way that we least expected him. On the one side he might get between us and the sea, and so cut us off from England; and on the other he might shove in between the Prussians and ourselves. But the Duke was as clever as he, for he had his horse and his light troops all round him, like a great spider's web, so that the moment a French foot stepped across the border he could close up all his men at the right place.|$|R

Refrigerators are being used more and more for this purpose for at least two reasons: they save the many, many steps which must be taken if the food is kept in a cool cellar or well, and they can be much more easily regulated as to temperature and dryness. We have learned to appreciate cool drinks and crisp vegetables on hot days so that the lack of ice as a means of making foods palatable would be a real hardship for many people, but the greatest value of a means of refrigeration comes in the enormous amount of food that can be saved by its use and the transportation of foods to far parts of the country...|$|R

He played with John Frusciante for many, many years and he actually toured with the Chili Peppers before, so he's sort of part of the extended family. He's stylistically very close to John but has a completely different trip. It sounds like the Red Hot Chili Peppers that you've never heard before."

In the face of this sobering truth, there is genuine hope to be found in the promises of God. Jesus did not wear blinders to the suffering of humanity two thousand years ago. He healed the sick and uplifted the downtrodden. He met people in the midst of their darkest hours of grief and sickness. So too does God abide <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> We have <b>been</b> given the promise that Jesus is <b>with</b> <b>us</b> always, to the end of the age. 1 In addition to that abiding present hope, Jesus gave us the hope of an eschatological kingdom of God. Such a vision is impossible for us to comprehend fully. There is however a foretaste of that kingdom we can share with all of our brothers and sisters in Christ. We have the prayer Jesus gave us which has the power to both unify all Christians and grant us a glimpse of the eschaton. That prayer is the Lord’s Prayer. 2 Prayer – broadly speaking – is one of the single greatest unifying activities of Christians, and consequentially, one of the most compelling motivators for ecumenical discussion.

60|$|A {{nation in}} such a {{condition}} as that is never truly artistic. The artist <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> even <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> an exceptional product. Art {{for a long time}} in England had nothing at all to do with the life of the people. It was a luxury for the rich, a curious thing for ladies' and gentlemen's consumption, as purely artificial as the stuccoed Italian villa in which they insisted on shivering in our chilly climate. And the pictures it produced were wholly alien to the popular wants and the popular feelings; they were part of an imported French, Italian, and Flemish tradition. English art has only slowly outgrown this stage, just in proportion as truly artistic handicrafts have sprung up here and there, and developed themselves among us. Go into the Cantagalli or the Ginori potteries at Florence, and you will see mere boys and girls, untrained children of the people, positively disporting themselves, with childish glee, in painting plates and vases. You will see them, not slavishly copying a given design of the master's, but letting their fancy run riot in lithe curves and lines, in griffons and dragons and floral twists-and-twirls of playful extravagance. They revel in ornament. <b>Now,</b> it <b>is</b> out of the loins of people like these that great artists spring by nature--not State-taught, artificial, made-up artists, but the real spontaneous product, the Lippi and Botticelli, the hereditary craftsmen, the born painters. And in England nowadays it is a significant fact that a large proportion of the truest artists--the innovators, the men who are working out a new style of English art for themselves, in accordance with the underlying genius of the British temperament, have sprung from the great industrial towns--Birmingham, Manchester, Leicester--where artistic handicrafts <b>are</b> <b>now</b> once more renascent. I won't expose myself to further ridicule by repeating here (what I nevertheless would firmly believe, were it not for the scoffers) that a large proportion of them are of Celtic descent--belong, in other words, to that section of the complex British nationality in which the noble traditions of decorative art never wholly died out--that section which was never altogether enslaved and degraded by the levelling and cramping and soul-destroying influences of manufacturing industrialism.|$|R

But, if {{we seek to}} {{know more}} than this and to {{ascertain}} {{the manner in which}} the story first crystallized into its shape, we shall find ourselves led back generally to one or other of two sources--either to actual historical events, represented by the fancy under figures personifying them; or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with life by the imaginative power usually more or less under the influence of terror. The historical myths we must leave the masters of history to follow; they, and the events they record, being yet involved in great, though attractive and penetrable, mystery. But the stars, and hills, and storms <b>are</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now,</b> as they <b>were</b> <b>with</b> others of old; and it only needs that we look at them with the earnestness of those childish eyes to understand the first words spoken of them by the children of men, and then, in all the most beautiful and enduring myths, we shall find, not only a literal story of a real person, not only a parallel imagery of moral principle, but an underlying worship of natural phenomena, out of which both have sprung, and in which both forever remain rooted. Thus, from the real sun, rising and setting,--from the real atmosphere, calm in its dominion of unfading blue, and fierce in its descent of tempest,--the Greek forms first the idea of two entirely personal and corporal gods, whose limbs are clothes in divine flesh, and whose brows are crowned with divine beauty; yet so real that the quiver rattles at their shoulder, and the chariot bends beneath their weight. And, on the other hand, collaterally with these corporeal images, and never for one instant separated from them, he conceives also two omnipresent spiritual influences, as the sun, with a constant fire, whatever in humanity is skilful and wise; and the other, like the living air, breathes the calm of heavenly fortitude, and strength of righteous anger, into every human breast that is pure and brave.|$|R
5000|$|When I {{first came}} {{on the show and}} was being interviewed, it was all about being the first gay character. A year and half later people are like, “So Sonny is doing so and so in his life.” He just became Sonny, not labeled just the first gay character. I think it was great that they came to know Sonny for Sonny. I think fans that waited will be very happy that they waited and hung in there <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Now,</b> Sonny <b>is</b> going to take Salem by storm and people can start to invest and enjoy in his storylines. On-Air On-Soaps What sets Sonny's {{introduction}} apart from the introductions of other gay characters is [...] "that he was comfortable, and out, and even his family was accepting of him" [...] Smith said. He continued, [...] "They just wanted to show that when you come out and you are with the people you trust and love—you can finally get out from under that rock, and just be who you are." [...] The openly gay Sonny slowly eases into canvas as he develops relationships with those he comes in contact with. Unlike most character introductions, Sonny is not immediately thrust into a romance. Already four months into his tenure, Smith insisted that he [...] "legitimately" [...] did not know who his love interest would be but he was excited because it was all people were talking about. Smith added that giving Sonny a love interest would make him much more [...] "dimensional" [...] as a character. [...] "Everyone on the show has a boy or a girl, and I am like the fifth wheel" [...] he joked. However, Smith came to appreciate the waiting period. [...] "It was important for people to get to know Sonny as a person and not just as this gay character on the show, who is dating another gay character." [...] One consistent theme with Sonny is that he is very open about his sexuality. While his parents are worried about how others will react—particularly Sonny's great uncle Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) -- [...] "Sonny is very comfortable. He'll tell anyone" [...] Smith said. Smith explained that Sonny [...] "just wants his friends and family to accept him for who he is." [...] Victor's support is something Sonny never questions because of how close they are. While said it would have been cool to do a coming-out story with Sonny he appreciated how comfortable Sonny is with being openly gay because [...] "It showed that it's great to have a support system. It made it easier for him to come out." [...] Not only does Sonny's introduction make him the only representation of a gay character on daytime television at the time as All My Children's iconic lesbian character, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) made her final appearances when the soap went off the air in September 2011, he was also the first [...] "official" [...] gay character in Days of Our Lives's 47-year history.|$|R
60|$|We shall find, {{as we go}} on, that {{he spent}} his money freely, as men did at Rome who had the command of large means. We are {{aware that he was}} often in debt. We find that from his letters. But he owed money not as a needy man does, but as one who is speculative, sanguine, and quite {{confident}} of his own resources. The management of incomes was not so fixed a thing then as it <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> Speculation <b>was</b> even more rampant, and rising men were willing and were able to become indebted for enormous sums, having no security to offer but the promise of their future career. Cæsar's debts during various times of his life were proverbial. He is said to have owed over £300,000 before he reached his first step in the public employment. Cicero rushed into no such danger as this. We know, indeed, that when the time came to him for public expenditure on a great scale, as, for instance, when he was filling the office of Ædile, he kept within bounds, and he did not lavish money which he did not possess. We know also that he refrained, altogether refrained, from the iniquitous habits of making large fortunes which were open to the great politicians of the Republic. To be Quæstor that he might be Ædile, Ædile that he might be Prætor and Consul, and Prætor and Consul that he might rob a province--pillage Sicily, Spain, or Asia, and then at last come back a rich man, rich enough to cope with all his creditors, and to bribe the judges should he be accused for his misdeeds--these were the usual steps to take by enterprising Romans toward power, wealth, and enjoyment. But it will be observed, in this sequence of circumstances, the robbery of the province was essential to success. This was sometimes done after so magnificent a fashion as to have become an immortal fact in history. The instance of Verres will be narrated in the next chapter but one. Something of moderation was more general, so that the fleeced provincial might still live, and prefer sufferance to the doubtful chances of recovery. A Proconsul might rob a great deal, and still return with hands apparently clean, bringing with him a score of provincial Deputies to laud his goodness before the citizens at home. But Cicero robbed not at all. Even they who have been most hard upon his name, accusing him of insincerity and sometimes of want of patriotism, because his Roman mode of declaring himself without reserve in his letters has been perpetuated for us by the excellence of their language, even they have acknowledged that he kept his hands studiously clean in the service of his country, when to have clean hands was so peculiar as to be regarded as absurd.|$|R
