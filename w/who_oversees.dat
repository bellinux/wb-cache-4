Tony and his partner, Nung, are told to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy flees as the police try to arrest him.

Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub and attempt to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, Cassidy escapes injured. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's cell phone to discover the identity of an informant: Vitayakul's girlfriend, Min. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's illegitimate son, <b>who</b> <b>oversees</b> Dragovic's southeast Asian human trafficking business, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father.
