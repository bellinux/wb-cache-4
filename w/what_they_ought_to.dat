25|$|It is {{one thing}} to worship a picture, it is another by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated. For what writing makes present to those reading, the same picturing makes present to the uneducated, to those perceiving visually, because in it the ignorant see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> follow, in it they read who do not know letters. Wherefore, and especially for the common people, picturing is the equivalent of reading.|$|E
500|$|Before his execution, Angiolillo claimed sole {{responsibility}} for the assassination. When asked about {{his involvement in the}} Cánovas affair, Betances said: [...] "No aplaudimos pero tampoco lloramos" [...] ("We don't applaud it, but we don't cry over it, either"), and added: [...] "Los revolucionarios verdaderos hacen lo que deben hacer" [...] ("True revolutionaries do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do"). Betances' ambiguous response blurs the true level of his involvement in the Cánovas assassination.|$|E

How does this work for group agents? There are two questions here. The first is whether groups can bear {{the same kinds of}} obligations as individuals. The second is whether groups’ pro tanto obligations plug into <b>what</b> <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do to the same degree that individuals’ pro tanto obligations plug into <b>what</b> <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|Uncertain {{what to do}} next, Everett was {{encouraged}} by his pastor, Joseph Stevens Buckminster of the Brattle Street Church, to study for the ministry. [...] This Everett did {{under the tutelage of}} Harvard President John Thornton Kirkland, earning his MA in 1813. [...] During this time in particular he developed a facility for working with both the written and spoken word. [...] The Reverend Buckminster died in 1812, and Everett was immediately offered the post at the Brattle Street Church on a probationary basis after his graduation, which was made permanent in November 1813. [...] Everett dedicated himself to the work, and became a highly popular Unitarian preacher. [...] Listeners wrote of his [...] "florid and affluent fancy", and his [...] "daring imagery", while one critic wrote what would become a common criticism of his speaking style: [...] " [...] spoke like some superior intelligence, discoursing to mortals of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> feel and know, but as if [...] himself were too far exalted to require such feelings, and such knowledge himself." [...] Everett, over the year he served in the pulpit, came to be disenchanted with the somewhat formulaic demands of the required oratory, and with the sometimes parochial constraints the congregation placed on him.|$|E
2500|$|A tribute of 3,000 gold pieces {{each year}} must have proven {{too much for}} the {{revenues}} of the Empire, because either John or David approached their relative by marriage Uzun Hasan about transferring the allegiance of Trebizond from the Ottomans to him. Uzun Hasan agreed to this, and sent envoys to Mehmed II. However, these envoys not only asked for the tribute to be transferred to the Aq Qoyunlu, they demanded on behalf of their master that Mehmed resume payment of tribute Mehmed's grandfather was said to have sent to the Aq Qoyunlu. The sources disagree on exactly how Mehmed II answered, but both versions were ominous. In one version, he told the envoys [...] "that it would not be long before they learned <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> expect from him." [...] In the other, Mehmed's response was, [...] "Go in peace, and next year I will bring these things with me, and I will clear up the debt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought us anything but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they will be <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” We should go into the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war. On the contrary it will tend to avert war…Neutrality is impossible and would be dishonorable.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore of Mopsuestia paraphrases: [...] "In {{addition}} to all which I have said, I give you this last commandment, to remember My law, which I gave to all Israel through Moses, plainly declaring <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do in each thing, and as the first token of obedience, to receive the Lord Christ when He cometh, appearing for the salvation of all men: Who will end the law, but show His own perfection. It had been well, had you immediately believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to}} the law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{argues that}} there is a need for a shift in {{thinking}} from 'men and boys as part of the problem' to 'men and boys as part of the solution'.

Young men need opportunities to experiment with different ways of behaving that affirm who <b>they</b> are, not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be.

We asked students about their attitudes and expectations because their attitudes may be expected to influence behavior over time. We found that both women and men held very egalitarian attitudes, which portends well for increasing gender equality. We also found evidence, however, that their answers did not always coincide with their intentions, suggesting that to some extent the opinions <b>they</b> expressed represent <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believed <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> say rather than their real opinions.
