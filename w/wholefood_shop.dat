50|$|The {{presence}} of the Centre in the Dyfi Valley has brought an increased environmental emphasis to the area, which is now designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In the nearest town, Machynlleth, CAT plc formerly operated a wholefood vegetarian café and a separate shop. Following the closure of CAT plc, the CAT charity retained ownership of the vegetarian cafe but subsequently sold it to its workers. The cafe is now run as a private enterprise but continues to operate as a vegetarian cafe. The <b>wholefood</b> <b>shop</b> was closed, as the building was not owned by CAT; however, a new <b>wholefood</b> <b>shop</b> Dyfi Wholefoods was opened by the staff who were made redundant. An industrial estate (the Dyfi Eco Park) near Machynlleth Railway Station houses the offices of Dulas Ltd, a renewable energy company started by ex-CAT employees.|$|E
5000|$|Llanidloes has a {{reputation}} as a very [...] "quirky" [...] town, known for its liberal, counterculture atmosphere. Llanidloes is known as a popular home for ageing hippies. The alternative atmosphere is apparent, with a <b>wholefood</b> <b>shop,</b> a volunteer-run organic shop and a vegetarian wholefood café. In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Wales. It was named {{one of the best places}} to live in Wales in 2017.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 Saunders {{moved into}} a {{warehouse}} in Neal's Yard, Covent Garden, where he opened a <b>wholefood</b> <b>shop.</b> This enterprise was successful and enabled him to start other businesses in the Yard including a dairy, cafe, the 'Apothecary' (dispensing alternative and natural remedies) and therapy rooms. Something {{of the character of}} Neal's Yard at the time is conveyed by pieces by Tim Hunkin: a water clock on the frontage of the shop and, inside the yard, a coin-operated animated wooden sculpture.|$|E
50|$|The Estate also {{is home to}} {{a number}} of small shops {{including}} 56a Infoshop - an anarchist bookshop and social centre formed out of the squatted ex-grocery turned <b>wholefoods</b> <b>shop</b> next door in the 1990s and Fareshares - the <b>wholefoods</b> <b>shop.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suma {{was started}} in 1975 by Reg Tayler. Reg had already gained some {{experience}} of wholefoods in London, and {{when he moved to}} Leeds he opened a retail shop, Plain Grain. In August 1975, at a meeting attended by all the <b>wholefood</b> <b>shops</b> in the north of England, he proposed they set up a wholefoods wholesaling co-operative in order to supply each other.|$|R
5000|$|Since then, {{the general}} Penny Lane area has {{acquired}} a distinct trendiness and desirability. The [...] "alternative" [...] businesses (<b>wholefood</b> outlets, charity <b>shops),</b> the now expanded array of cafés, bars, bistros, and takeaway food emporiums, as well as handily located traditional businesses (WHSmiths and Clarke's cake shop), make the neighbourhood the most sought-after among Liverpool's large student population. Though the song refers to Penny Lane junction on Smithdown Road, the street itself also leads down {{at the other end}} to the University of Liverpool's student halls of residence, near Sefton Park.|$|R
40|$|Bonnington Square {{is right}} {{in the heart of}} London, just two minutes walk from the river and just ten minutes from the Houses of Parliament. In the early eighties the one hundred houses of the Square were all squatted, forming a bohemian {{community}} from all around the world. The squat had two community gardens, a cafe, a <b>wholefood</b> <b>shop,</b> a nightclub, a newsletter and even a milkbar. Although it is no longer squatted, there are still many low rent housing cooperatives, and the cafe and the gardens are still collectively run, and the Square is now a model of a modern sustainable urban community.
