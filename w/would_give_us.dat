25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> hope.|$|E
500|$|Paul Gitter, Marvel Entertainment's {{president}} of consumer products, {{commented that the}} build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: [...] "Retailers have been less tolerant with [...] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> shelf space throughout the years {{and we would have}} a more sustainable position in the marketplace".|$|E
500|$|Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as [...] "by far the world's most popular unsigned band".|$|E

500|$|As Radiohead's six-album {{contract}} with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I {{like the people}} at our record company, but the time is at hand {{when you have to}} ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model."

500|$|Lopez, {{who also}} served as {{producer}} on the film, chose a fellow Latino actor Guzman to cast in the film, and for which she stated that [...] "two Latinos opening in a mainstream movie, if it does well, that's gonna change things. I would love for the Latino community {{to come out and}} support this movie because it <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the freedom." [...] She also stated that [...] "We [...] don't have to be close-minded, where two Latinos have to be speaking Spanish or they have to have some Latin reference in the movie... That's what I love about this film. We're breaking down the walls and stereotypes." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur also {{attempted}} to secure Cobby's {{support for the}} protest. The commander of No.1 TAF had been the Australian Flying Corps' leading ace in World WarI, as Caldwell was the RAAF's in World WarII. Arthur reasoned that, although Cobby was partly {{to blame for the}} morale issue, [...] "we felt that his value to our move, because of his name with the Public, together with Group Captain Caldwell, <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a very considerable amount of public support...he was the prima donna of one war, and... arm-in-arm with the prima donna of the next war, we would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in the headlines of the newspapers." [...] Cobby refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of the depth of feeling among the pilots.|$|E

5000|$|By June 2015, DARPA and the Air Force had {{reportedly}} began SALVO flights, potentially {{having already}} commenced them to counter Chinese and Russian electronic and infrared surveillance; this could mean ALASA <b>would</b> <b>give</b> the <b>U.S.</b> a [...] "stealth satellite launch" [...] capability.|$|R
500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{bilateral}} {{negotiations between the}} United States and Colombia which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces increased access to several Colombian military bases for the stated purpose of fighting terrorism and the drug trade generated controversy throughout the region. Venezuela's Hugo Chávez criticized the proposed deal as {{the creation of a}} purported [...] "imperialist beachhead" [...] while Colombian diplomats defended the agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that [...] "there was no intention to expand the number of permanent [...] personnel [...] beyond the maximum permitted by Congress." [...] Other Latin American nations, including Brazil, also expressed their own concerns about the matter.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1938 {{speech to}} the Black Hills Indian Treaty Council Seneca {{journalist}} Alice Lee Jemison said: [...] "The Wheeler-Howard Act provides only one form of government for the Indian and that is communal or cooperative form of living. John Collier {{said he was going}} to give the Indian self-government. If he was going to give us self-government he would let us set up a form of government we wanted to live under. He <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the right to continue to live under our old tribal customs if we wanted to." [...] According to historian Brian Dippie, [...] "(Collier) became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally Kurzweil {{says there}} is the {{prospect}} of virtual bodies, where direct neural implants <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> the sensation of having bodies {{and a way to}} exert control, without any physical manifestation at all. Although he quickly brings things back to nanotechnology by pointing out that sufficiently advanced nanotechnology will be like having a virtual world, since [...] "utility fog" [...] will appear to be entirely absent and then instantly morph into functional physical shapes. Kurzweil broaches the topic of sex in futuristic times, reminding us that every new technology [...] "adopts sexual themes". Kurzweil envisions virtual sex, sexbots, and as well as more chaste activities like strolling along a [...] "virtual Cancún beach".|$|E
2500|$|After Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief (2003), Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one.

[...] In 2006, he called major record labels [...] "stupid little boys' games – especially really high up." [...] In 2007, Radiohead independently released their album In Rainbows as a download for which listeners could choose their price; Yorke said the [...] "most exciting" [...] part of the release was the removal of the barrier between artist and audience.|$|E
60|$|If General Hancock's {{orders of}} the 15th had been communicated to him, that officer, with his usual promptness, would {{undoubtedly}} have been upon the ground around Petersburg as early as four {{o'clock in the afternoon}} of the 15th. The days were long and it <b>would</b> have <b>given</b> him considerable time before night. I do not think there is any doubt that Petersburg itself could have been carried without much loss; or, at least, if protected by inner detached works, that a line could have been established very much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy. This <b>would</b> have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> control of both the Weldon and South Side railroads. This would also have saved an immense amount of hard fighting which had to be done from the 15th to the 18th, and <b>would</b> have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> greatly the advantage in the long siege which ensued.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{substantial}} media {{interest in}} the report's description of Narendra Modi's role in the riots, based, for example, on video footage of a senior Bajrang Dal leader saying that at a public meeting {{on the day of}} the fire, [...] "he had <b>given</b> <b>us</b> three days to do whatever we could.

2500|$|Those Spaniards from Castilla del Oro {{presented}} {{themselves in}} Cuba to Diego Velázquez, the governor (and relative of Bernal Díaz del Castillo), who promised them [...] "...that he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> Indians when some were available".

2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
