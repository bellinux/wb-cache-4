40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the use of bamboo foils as structural reinforcement for MDP <b>wooden</b> <b>panels.</b> Four <b>wooden</b> <b>panels</b> of homogeneous layer were produced using particles of GT 1 and RRIM 600 clones of Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree), and glued with urea-formaldehyde resin (UF). These panels were also overlaid with foils of Phyllostachys edulis (mossô bamboo). The tests were realized to evaluate the physical-mechanical characterization according to European standards (EN). The production of the particleboards with reinforcement of bamboo improves the physical-mechanical characteristics of these commercial <b>wooden</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R

25|$|The next boat {{to receive}} the Italian {{attention}} was MTB 316, only 50 yards away from Scipione Africanos port side. The motor torpedo vessel caught fire and blew up {{just a few seconds}} after the cruiser's salvos struck home. The craft, commanded by lieutenant Richard Adams and with a crew of eleven, sank with all hands. The explosion took place so close to the cruiser that pieces from MTB 316s machinery and hull fell aboard Scipione Africano.

25|$|The oldest known {{surviving}} {{example of}} the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a <b>wooden</b> <b>panel,</b> had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed {{to be a very}} high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|To be hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} was from 1351 a statutory penalty in England for men convicted of high treason, although the ritual was first recorded {{during the reign}} of King Henry III (1216–1272). Convicts were fastened to a hurdle, or <b>wooden</b> <b>panel,</b> and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where they were hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded, and quartered (chopped into four pieces). Their remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge. [...] For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake.|$|E

The south wall of the chancel has a decorated <b>wooden</b> <b>panel</b> dated 1644, {{which used to be}} part of a pulpit. The north wall was removed when the chapel was added, and a beam placed across the opening. [...] The chapel measures 20feet by 12feet 9inches (6.1 by 3.9m). Its roof is also from the 16th century and is similar to the nave roof. There is a blocked 16th-century doorway with a pointed arch on the chapel's west side.|$|E

500|$|The <b>wooden</b> <b>panel</b> {{measures}} 163by110centimetres(64by43inches) and {{is composed}} of five vertical deals (softwood planks) reinforced by two horizontal dovetail battens. The battens, together with the rough scrub planed back, have effectively reduced warping to a minimum and the artwork is well preserved, with only insignificant fissures and attacks by insects. [...] A dendrochronological examination of the panel by doctor Peter Klein at the Institute für Holzbiologie in Hamburg determined that it is made of pine deals (Pinus silvestris), the annual rings of which date from various periods ranging from the 1480s to around 1618. The painting can therefore date no further back than around 1620. This {{is consistent with the}} year 1636 given on the frame and mentioned in the parish accounts.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the museum}} was {{equipped}} with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's Self-Portrait (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting {{off the wall and}} [...] attempted to take the <b>wooden</b> <b>panel</b> out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame, as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black. [...] They also removed Vermeer's The Concert and Govaert Flinck's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty.|$|E
500|$|Notwithstanding the {{excellent}} {{state of the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>panel</b> prior to its 1998 restoration, the painting was unevenly covered with layers of dust and yellowed varnish. This was particularly pronounced {{in the area of}} the sky, obscuring many fine details and altering this area's colouring. Once these layers were removed, it was discovered that the original grey-blue sky had been repainted with broad strokes of a deep blue dye mixed with a fixing agent. An analysis of the blue pigments in the painting showed that the original blue colour, still discernible as a bright line above the horizon, was composed of azurite, while the blue pigment in more superficial layers was true ultramarine or lapis lazuli. The ultramarine layer has been identified as prussian blue, a pigment which was favoured from the early 18th century onwards. Additional alteration of the painting is well attested in parish accounts; the painting was [...] "varnished and somewhat restored" [...] by the painter Aline Bernard (1841–1910) in 1885, and a second time in 1907 by a Nils Janzon. The latter restoration was probably limited to the addition of a thick layer of varnish.|$|E

500|$|Once sentenced, malefactors {{were usually}} held {{in prison for}} a few days before being taken to the place of execution. During the early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied {{directly}} to the back of a horse, but it subsequently became customary to be fastened instead to a wicker hurdle, or <b>wooden</b> <b>panel,</b> itself tied to the horse. [...] Historian Frederic William Maitland thought that this was probably to [...] " [...] for the hangman a yet living body". [...] The use of the word drawn, as in [...] "to draw", has caused a degree of confusion. [...] One of the Oxford English Dictionary's definitions of draw is [...] "to draw out the viscera or intestines of; to disembowel (a fowl, etc. before cooking, a traitor or other criminal after hanging)", but this is followed by [...] "in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this, or , is meant. The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged, the sense is as here." [...] Historian Ram Sharan Sharma arrived at the same conclusion: [...] "Where, as in the popular hung, drawn and quartered [...] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), drawn follows hanged or hung, it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor." [...] The historian and author Ian Mortimer disagrees. [...] In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that drawing means to disembowel is spurious. [...] Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.|$|E
