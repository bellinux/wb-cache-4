Due to the author's passion about Brazil, it <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> area, although it can be applicable to many other world regions. The core intent is to offer aquaponics as an alternative agriculture system that is viable in the developing world, and in particular Brazil. This thesis also serves as a proposal for the continuation of the research and development of the theory that aquaponics is a viable tool for sustainable community development...|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} is a progressive condition, where beta cell function declines and fails, therefore requiring almost all individuals to be commenced on insulin therapy. There {{appears to be}} a very real clinical inertia within community care in relation to the initiation of insulin and GLP- 1 hormones in the community. This appears to be dependent on a number of variables, most notably cost, efficacy and side-effects. Also access to specialist supports such as access to a diabetes specialist nurse and consultant care has to be considered. This is not just unique to Ireland, it is a worldwide phenomenon. As with most insulin initiation and GLP- 1 hormone initiation in the community, it is primarily for individuals with type 2 diabetes, so this article <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> population...|$|E

This article surveys the principal new results with particular attention to general issues of packing in liquids. 1. Introduction Aqueous solutions of colloidal solutes are preeminent examples of complex liquids. In such settings, attention is often directed towards the issues of macromolecular structure, aggregation, and dynamics. However, one aspect of these problems is stubbornly associated with the small size scale of molecules, in particular the small size of a water molecule. That problem is the molecular understanding and description of hydration e#ects [...] hydrophobic e#ects [...] that stabilize membranes, micelles, folded proteins, and aggregates of such structures. This presentation <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> basic, molecular scale issue underlying aqueous solutions of interest both to biophysics and material science [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{statistical}} characteristics of financial series, we propose a methodology {{that allows us}} to accurately forecast the relative returns of financial assets and to implement tactical asset allocation (TAA) strategies, as part of a basic portfolio management model (equities, bonds and cash). We <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> line of investigation which, with the implication of predictability in series of returns, allows us, on the basis of fundamental variables, to exploit the set of information that these offer in order to segment and classify homogenous areas, on the basis of which we can predict higher returns from one asset relative to another. The proposed technique is classification and regression trees. Once the forecast relative returns are calculated, a TAA system is developed from which we derive the structure of the optimal aggressiveness factors of the various tactical strategies, which allows us, using a benchmark portfolio, to calculate the weightings to hold in each of the assets. 1 1.

40|$|Competing-risks {{survival}} regression {{provides a}} useful alternative to Cox regression {{in the presence of}} one or more competing risks. For example, say that you are studying the time from initial treatment for cancer to recurrence of cancer in relation to the type of treatment administered and demographic factors. Death is a competing event: the person under treatment may die, impeding the occurence of the event of interest, recurrence of cancer. Unlike censoring, which merely obstructs you from viewing the event, a competing event prevents the event of interest from occurring altogether. Depending on the scope of your statistical inference, your analysis may need to be adjusted for competing risks. Stata’s new stcrreg command implements competing-risks regression based on Fine and Gray’s proportional subhazards model. This talk <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> new command, and compare the method of Fine and Gray to a method based on directly modeling cause-specific hazards. Regardless of method, the focus is on estimating the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for the event of interest in the presence of competing events. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{recent article}} [D] in this journal {{investigated}} graphs arising from chess-like moves along hexagonal cells. Here we will expand on that discussion. There is an actual game of hex chess (developed by Gliński in 1936 [WI]) {{and it seems}} reasonable to name pieces as in that game. True hex chess has the cells arranged in a large hexagon, which is of course similar to the subdivision of a square that governs traditional chess. But the triangular array is geometrically attractive so, as in [D], we <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> Two graphs of interest are the graph of the hex rook (called a queen in [D]) and also the king of [D], which is not a true hex king but is a triangular grid graph, TGn. That graph is just the dual of the hex board (Fig. 1) : vertices are cells and edges correspond to adjacent cells. We will also look at the bishops of [D] because — surprise — they turn out to be isomorphic to traditional chess bishops. Figure 1. The triangular grid graph (left) and a type of hex bishop graph. All of these provide interesting areas of exploration: sometimes there are patterns that lead to interesting formulas. Sometimes the conjectured formulas can be proved. And sometimes there are no formulas, but getting values is a significant computational challenge. We shall mention some of the highlights here...|$|E

40|$|Issues {{stemming}} from differences and similarities in cultural identities affect residents and workforces in care homes in Scotland, {{as they do}} across the United Kingdom. Theoretical guidance and policy drivers emphasise the importance of considering cultural diversity when planning or enacting person-centred care processes, regardless of where health or social care takes place. Nevertheless, there is a recognised worldwide dearth of research concerning the intersections of culture, dementia and long-term care. This being so, a recent research study found that inadequate understandings of issues {{stemming from}} cultural diversity could be seen to constrain person-centred care in some Scottish care homes. In addition, the study uncovered little-recognised socio-cultural phenomena which were observed to positively enhance person-centre care. This article <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> and will lay out findings from the study which lead to the following broad assertion: there is a broad {{lack of understanding of}} the power, and potential utility, of shared identity and community as a bulwark against the erosion of personhood which is often associated with dementia. This article describes these findings in some detail, thereby providing fresh insights into how shared cultural identity, and the sense of community it may bring, bears upon the interactions between workers and residents with dementia in Scottish care homes. It then suggests how the school of ‘person-centred care’ may be developed through further research into these phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in organic farming has increased the interest in examining if different growing characteristics among varieties would explain differences in yield differently in conventional compared to organic systems. This work <b>will</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> question. The analyses are performed using data from trials with spring barley in Denmark and Sweden.

The model is setup in order to estimate simultaneously the effect of the growing characteristics and the possible interactions between those that can be expected to interact. The analyses showed that the relation between yield and the growth characteristics volume weight or grain weight depended on the growing system but in different ways in the two countries. The relation between yield and the disease powdery mildew were stronger in the conventional grown trials than in the organic grown trials. There was a tendency for the same difference to apply for the diseases leaf rust, net blotch and scald in Danish trials and net blotch in Northern Sweden, but not for scald in Northern Sweden.
