5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as {{to do so would}} be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E
5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E
5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|E

25|$|On April 8, with a month {{left in his}} tour, Cleland {{was ordered}} {{to set up a}} radio relay station on a nearby hill. A {{helicopter}} flew him and two soldiers to the treeless top of Hill 471, east of Khe Sanh. Cleland knew some of the soldiers camped there from Operation Pegasus. He told the pilot he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> a while with friends.|$|E
25|$|Later, Jaypaw convinces Lionpaw and Hollypaw {{that they}} need to find Sol and ask about the prophecy. They find him outside of the territories in an {{abandoned}} Twoleg nest, different from the one on ThunderClan territory, and Sol tells them all he knows. On the way back, they get caught by a ShadowClan patrol and Sol goes to Blackstar and tells the three apprentices that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in ShadowClan. In the time between then and the next Gathering, it seems that Sol has convinced Blackstar and his clan to stop believing in StarClan. Sol and Blackstar arrive at the Gathering together and Blackstar announces he has lost faith in StarClan and won't attend Gatherings anymore.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{evidence}} {{over three}} days, Harwood said that Tomlinson [...] "just {{looked as if}} he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> where he was forever and was almost inviting physical confrontation in terms of being moved on." [...] He said he had not warned Tomlinson and had acted because Tomlinson was encroaching a police line, which amounted to a breach of the peace. The court heard that Tomlinson's last words after collapsing were, [...] "they got me, the fuckers got me"; he died moments later. On 3 May 2011 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, ruling that the officer—Harwood was not named for legal reasons—had used excessive and unreasonable force in hitting Tomlinson, and had acted [...] "illegally, recklessly and dangerously." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{he played}} for the Porto Rico Stars, Alejandro Pompéz called him and made him an offer {{to play with the}} New York Cubans, which at the time he owned. Pompéz became {{interested}} in Coimbre after hearing several reviews of his work, but he was skeptical of these claims and therefore he was hesitant to contract him at first and didn't do so until a group of players recommended him. He debuted in a game against a team named Buschwick, in a game that took place in Brooklyn, New York. In his first two games with the team he connected four hits, three singles and a double. Following this performance Pompéz informed him that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the team. After the season concluded he was instantly offered a second contract with the Cubans, which by this time where playing in the National League of the Negro League. He also participated with Ponce during the 19401941 season of the winter league and concluded the season with a batting average of [...]401 and no strikeouts. During his second season with the Cubans he had an average of [...]409, and was included in the league's All-star Game {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
2500|$|He {{married his}} second wife, Yvonne Spenceley Gibb, on 17 October 1975. They had two children, Adam and Samantha Gibb, and their {{marriage}} lasted until his death. Maurice's alcoholic nadir came in 1991, {{when he pulled}} a gun on {{his wife and kids}} after a month-long bender. [...] She left him and immediately went over to brother Barry's house, refusing to come back until he had done something about his drinking. Maurice went into rehab, calling Yvonne telling her he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> because he really wanted to stop drinking. [...] She said that was the call she had been waiting for.|$|E
2500|$|He {{became a}} notable player {{after he took}} a {{successful}} catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen on the 4th day of the first Test between England and Australia. Sabburg was fielding at fine leg for only two deliveries when Ryan Harris left the field for a short time. Pietersen hit a short ball from Mitchell Johnson towards fine leg where it was caught by Sabburg sprinting from the boundary to secure a catch. Pietersen was dismissed for 26 and Australia {{went on to win}} the game by 381 runs. Sabburg said after the game: [...] "It wasn't a very hard catch, to be honest. I just had to do the simple things and catch it. All the boys got around so it was pretty awesome. I was hoping 'Harry' <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> off … I wanted to stay on." [...] It also was not the first time substitute fielders were notably used in a Test between England and Australia. In 2005 at Trent Bridge England's substitute fielder Gary Pratt famously ran out Ricky Ponting.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the reports}} that Alfie would {{discover}} the affair, {{it was reported that}} several different storyline endings had been filmed, but that Wallace had been told the identity of Kat's lover, with a show source saying: [...] "The time felt right to finally tell Jessie, but she is still {{one of only a handful}} of people who knows the answer to the question on everyone's lips. [...] Lorraine [...] was adamant this story <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> quiet for as long as possible. She has done everything in her power to let it play out on screen with total secrecy behind the scenes. It's created a real buzz as everyone's been trying to figure out who Kat's been bedding. Up until now, none of the cast were in the know, not even her on-screen lover. It really has been that cloak and dagger. Richie revealed that Wallace had found not knowing the identity of Kat's lover [...] "frustrating" [...] but that she was [...] "torn between whether she wanted to know or not, because if she had known, she was frightened she might give it away by just a look", while Richie himself was happy not to know, [...] "because Alfie was in the same position", adding that both actors were [...] "happy to let it play out, though, because Kat flirts outrageously with all three Branning brothers, so we wanted the audience to make up their own minds about who the mystery lover was." ...|$|E
