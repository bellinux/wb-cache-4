A family of five living on the poverty line which uses 20cubic meter of water per month would spend less than 1.2% of its budget on its water bill if it had a <b>water</b> <b>meter.</b> If it did not have a <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> and was charged a flat rate, it would pay 2.0% of its budget. This percentage lies below the often used affordability threshold of 5%. However, at that time the average metered tariff was estimated at only 0.03 per m3, or less than three times what it was estimated to be in 2007. Apparently no more up-to-date estimates on the share of the average water bill in the budget of the poor are available.|$|E

Reid and his wife lived in the building, and lost all their {{possessions}} in the fire. Total damage {{was estimated to be}} between $50,000 and $75,000. Within two days of the blaze, the village purchased a fire truck and scheduled hearings for alternate-side parking and <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> proposals. By this time, the Army Corps of Engineers had built a [...] flood wall, relocated several buildings, dredged the bottom of the creek, and raised a [...] portion of Main Street about [...] The project caused the [...] island in the creek to become a peninsula, connected to the northern bank. Since the completion of these projects, the village has not suffered floods as extreme as those of 1955.|$|E
500|$|Semi-desert cacti need careful watering. General {{advice is}} hard to give, since the {{frequency}} of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown, {{the nature of the}} growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti. Brown says that more cacti are lost through the [...] "untimely application of water than for any other reason" [...] and that even during the dormant winter season, cacti need some water. Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere). Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use hard water, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts. The general advice given is that during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings. A <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> can help in determining when the soil is dry.|$|E
5000|$|In many {{developed}} countries <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> are {{used to measure the}} volume of water used by residential and commercial buildings that are supplied with water by a public water supply system. <b>Water</b> <b>meters</b> can also be used at the water source, well, or throughout a water system to determine flow through a particular portion of the system. In most of the world <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> measure flow in cubic metres (m3) or litres [...] but in the USA and some other countries <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> are calibrated in cubic feet (ft.3) or US gallons on a mechanical or electronic register.

2500|$|... 80% of the {{population}} is supplied by centralised public water systems. Public water supply systems and providers are governed by the Water Services Acts of 2007 to 2014. Until 2015, this legislation provided for the provision of water and wastewater services by local authorities, with domestic usage funded through central taxation, and non-domestic usage funded via local authority rates. From 2015, legislation came into force such that a new utility company, Irish Water, became responsible for providing water and wastewater services. The new company was set up as a subsidiary of an existing semi-state corporation, Bord Gáis (Ervia). The newly created company effectively took on the existing local authority employees and water management facilities, pipes and infrastructure. Operationally, Irish Water delegated some work, for example <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> installation and customer support, to sub-contractors.|$|E
2500|$|... 20% of the {{population}} is supplied by wells, small private supplies and public or private group schemes. Group water schemes are found in rural areas and are outside the scope of the centralised public mains systems. A group scheme is a scheme servicing water or wastewater services to two or more households not connected to the centralised water supply and/or wastewater collection systems. Group schemes are private or public, depending on whether their water is supplied from the public mains or a private source. All group schemes connected to centralised supplies are fitted with a <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> for monitoring the amount of water used by the group. The EPA 2011 report on drinking water quality in Ireland indicated that there were 1,129 group water schemes, serving 7% of the public, covered by the Drinking Water Regulations because they serve more than 50 people or supply a commercial operation. 643 are public group schemes and 486 are private group water schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike most action {{role-playing}} games, {{instead of}} the characters leveling up, their weapons do. Weapons attain [...] "absorption points" [...] with each kill. Once {{a certain number of}} points has been reached, the weapon can be leveled up. However, weapons wear out over time, and it is necessary to repair them in order to avoid them breaking. With the exception of each characters' starting weapon, a broken weapon is immediately removed from the player's inventory and cannot be retrieved or repaired. To upgrade a weapon, the player can attach stat-increasing items (attack power, speed, ability to kill different types of monsters, elemental attributes, etc.), but a single weapon can only carry a limited number of attachments. These attachments are absorbed into the weapon when it is leveled up, freeing up space for more attachments. When a weapon reaches level five, it can be transformed into a [...] "SynthSphere," [...] which carries 60% of the weapon's power and attributes. This sphere can then be attached to another weapon, and absorbed into it when it levels up, just like a regular attachment. The characters themselves can only grow stronger with the consumption of particular items, which can increase their health points, <b>water</b> <b>meter</b> and defense.|$|E

Recent studies have estimated that <b>water</b> supplies are <b>metered</b> {{in less than}} 30% of UK households, and about 61% of urban Canadian homes (as of 2001). Although individual <b>water</b> <b>meters</b> have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent. In addition to raising consumer awareness of their <b>water</b> use, <b>metering</b> {{is also an important}} way to identify and localize <b>water</b> leakage. <b>Water</b> <b>metering</b> would benefit society {{in the long run it}} is proven that <b>water</b> <b>metering</b> increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come.
