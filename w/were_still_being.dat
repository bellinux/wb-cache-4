5|$|Cut stone {{originally}} {{facing the}} buildings {{was taken to}} build the new buildings of Santa Cruz del Quiché; the ruins <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> mined for construction material through the late 19th century, doing extensive damage to {{the remains of the}} old buildings.|$|E
5|$|Metal medical corsets <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> made in {{the twentieth}} century, whilst, since the late 20th century, fashion {{designers}} such as Alexander McQueen and Issey Miyake have made contemporary metal bodices and corsets from wire and aluminium coils.|$|E

5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|Honorius died on 30 September 653, {{the last}} of the Gregorian missionaries. He was buried at the Church of St. Augustine's in Canterbury. He was later revered as a saint, with his feast day being 30 September. His relics were {{translated}} to a new tomb in 1091, and around that same time a haigiography of his life was written by Goscelin. In the 1120s his relics <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> venerated at St Augustine's.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Churchill-Redman Ltd {{bought the}} Longfield foundry in Halifax to provide extra {{production}} capacity and leased {{a part of}} the Vickers Armstrong Admiralty works in Scotswood, Newcastle. It was intended that the Newcastle site concern itself with a range of lathes intended for the motor industry, Austin and Vauxhall in particular; the Halifax operation would focus on manufacture of Fay lathes which <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> licensed from the US.|$|E
50|$|A senior British diplomat {{told the}} BBC that some 2,500 people <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> {{held by the}} military. British {{officials}} also received first-hand accounts of grim conditions under which many detainees <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> held.

5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W. Bush declared the area a disaster area on July 18. The damage was so intense that much of the area was without power for a week, and trees <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> cleared a year later.|$|E
5|$|More than 3,000 {{aftershocks}} {{were reported}} by the Gifu weather observatory in the 14 months following the event. According to a 1976 study by Takeshi Mikumo and Masataka Ando, three or four shocks per year <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> detected. Several university studies of the microearthquake activity were undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s and the areas southwest of the Neodani fault and near Gifu and Inuyama {{were found to be}} experiencing elevated activity.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{published}} numerous compilations of songs, {{including two}} six-volume textbook series, which were widely {{used throughout the}} United States. Most of her writings were focused on children's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the limited range and short attention span of children. Many of her compositions <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> used in music education programs {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Register's earliest {{years in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed, and underfunded. However, funds <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} conclusions <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> debated by {{academics and}} conspiracy theorists more than 50 {{years after the}} assassination. One such theorist, Texas author Jim Marrs, wrote that most researchers were ready to accept Lovelady as the man in Altgens' photograph. He later wrote that others were resisting any such acceptance.|$|E
5|$|While the {{revisions}} to the play Blackrock <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to produce a film version, which would also be titled Blackrock. Blackrock was released in 1997. Rebecca Smart reprised her role as Cherie in the film. Simon Lyndon who portrayed Jared in the play was cast as Ricko in the film.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} {{continued to}} be described into the early 20th century, with notable paleontologists such as Barnum Brown and Charles Camp collecting specimens. However, aetosaur remains <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> confused with those of phytosaurs. During this time, aetosaurs were usually considered {{to be members of}} Pseudosuchia, a now obsolete group consisting of various Triassic archosaurs including phytosaurs. However, similarities were often observed between aetosaurs and Crocodilia, the group to which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 19th century. While the skull had many features in common with pseudosuchians, parts of the postcranial skeleton, in particular the scutes, seemed to be similar to those of crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|In Delaware, the {{flooding}} damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the Glenville area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous {{people in their}} cars and homes, forcing at least one rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools. The severe flooding washed out most of a bridge in Hockessin and destroyed 6 Wilmington & Western Railroad bridges, causing about $5million (2003USD, $5.5million 2006USD) in damage. The railroad bridges <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> rebuilt as of 2006. Greenbank Mill, a historic gristmill complex, saw $450,000 in damage. Damage in Delaware totaled to $16.1million (2003USD, $17.5million 2006USD).|$|E

5|$|In July 2015, {{construction}} was delayed as contracts <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> finalised, and the completion date {{was moved to}} during the 2016–17 season. Construction was delayed again a month later, with work to begin in February or March 2016, for completion in April or May 2017. With construction costs increasing due to more detailed design work, construction inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional £7.2million in March 2016, raising {{the total cost of}} the project to £44.2million. Construction was delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>being</b> recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
