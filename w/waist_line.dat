2500|$|Diabetes now affects over 14 {{million people}} in the central and {{southern}} regions of Africa; this number is expected to increase to 28 million people by 2030, according to the IDF Africa. The NGO Project Hope cites lifestyle changes as the primary cause of the increase of diabetes, specifically type 2 diabetes, which seems to correspond with a growing <b>waist</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Lack of physical activity, increased consumption of processed food and unmanaged portion sizes all contribute to the rise of diabetes – a major component of cardiometabolic risk. In countries where there are food crises, “much of the foods donated from the international community are calorie-dense foods”, according to Project Hope’s Senior Advisor, Paul Madden. [...] Nutrition education is essential to prevent type 2 diabetes from consuming the continent. The NGO also suggests that in some villages, 70 to 80 percent of the people may not even be aware that they are living with the disease.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not often}} that His Royal Highness graced Bath with his presence, and the {{occasion}} was made the excuse for quite exceptional gaiety and brilliancy. The new fashions of this memorable year of 1793 had defied {{the declaration of}} war and filtrated through from Paris: London milliners had not been backward in taking the hint, and {{though most of the}} more starchy dowagers obstinately adhered to the pre-war fashions--the huge hooped skirts, stiff stomachers, pointed waists, voluminous panniers and monumental head erections--the young and smart matrons were everywhere to be seen in the new gracefully flowing skirts innocent of steel constructions, the high <b>waist</b> <b>line,</b> the pouter pigeon-like draperies over their pretty bosoms.|$|E
60|$|What {{he ought}} to have done, what any man {{retaining}} his common sense would have done the moment he got his hands upon the thing, was to turn off the tap. Then he might have played foot-ball with the man, or battledore and shuttlecock as he pleased; and the twenty or thirty people who had rushed forward to assist would have only applauded. His idea, however, as he explained to us afterwards, was to take away the hose from the man, and, for punishment, turn it upon the fool himself. The waterman's idea appeared to be the same, namely, to retain the hose as a weapon with which to soak Harris. Of course, the result was that, between them, they soused every dead and living thing within fifty yards, except themselves. One furious man, too drenched to care what more happened to him, leapt into the arena and also took a hand. The three among them proceeded to sweep the compass with that hose. They pointed it to heaven, and the water descended upon the people {{in the form of an}} equinoctial storm. They pointed it downwards, and sent the water in rushing streams that took people off their feet, or caught them about the <b>waist</b> <b>line,</b> and doubled them up.|$|E

5000|$|A {{year later}} was the {{formation}} of a team that was to extend rugby players careers (and their <b>waist</b> <b>lines)</b> even further - a Vets team - The Stragglers was started at Marlow. Charlie Child was the first Captain and Past President David Sumpter was his Vice-Captain. With an entry age of 35, many players who were nearing the end of their playing days were able to enjoy a more sedate, less intensive game against teams of similar ages and abilities. Vets teams took on an identity of their own, with teams calling themselves names such as Chiltern 100's, Beaconsfield Boars, Wycombe Bodgers, Feltham Ponderers and Camberley Gin and Tonics. Vets rugby became well established around the country and such was the attraction of this type of rugby that in April 1975, the Stragglers played a team consisting of the Fleet Street Rugby Winters under floodlights at Riverwoods. It was probably the only time that players could get their own back for what may have been written about them! ...|$|R
