5|$|When André Breton {{wrote his}} first Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, his {{historical}} precedents as inclusions named only Gustave Moreau, Georges Seurat and Uccello. However, the Surrealist movement soon rediscovered Bosch and Breughel, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> became popular among the Surrealist painters.

5|$|The loss of Gibraltar {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on Gibraltar) to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, hoping they might recover it. But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed.|$|E
5|$|After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) {{ordered the}} four s in 1889, a {{combination}} of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), {{and a lack of}} a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> proposed and secured approval for the first Naval Law in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The Wittelsbachs were broadly similar to the Kaiser Friedrichs, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.|$|E
5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic freedoms, and granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E

5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (<b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success {{in that part of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|Central African Republic President David Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, {{took over}} the country in 1960, after winning a power {{struggle}} against Abel Goumba. Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{thorough}} search, the revolutionaries discovered only seven prisoners in the Bastille, rather fewer {{than had been}} anticipated. Of these, only one – de Whyte de Malleville, an elderly and white-bearded man – closely resembled the public image of a Bastille prisoner; despite being mentally ill, he was paraded through the streets, where he waved happily to the crowds. Of the remaining six liberated prisoners, four were convicted forgers <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> vanished into the Paris streets; one was the Count de Solages, who had been imprisoned on the request of his family for sexual misdemeanours; the sixth was a man called Tavernier, who also proved to be mentally ill and, along with Whyte, was in due course reincarcerated in the Charenton asylum.|$|E

5|$|During the First English Civil War {{between the}} {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, Mersea Fort saw no action; after the victory of Parliament in 1646, the fort's garrison was demobilised. Conflict flared again in 1648 with {{the outbreak of the}} Second English Civil War, and Colchester was taken by the Royalists. The town was immediately besieged by General Thomas Fairfax, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> seized Mersea Fort, which controlled the supply route by river into Colchester, before the Royalists could do so. The fort had contained five pieces of artillery: two culverins, two sakers and one drake. A Royalist raiding party of 300 soldiers was sent to recapture the fort, but without success.|$|E
5|$|Euler's formal {{education}} started in Basel, {{where he was}} sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel, and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics. At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek, and Hebrew at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) {{recovered}} Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261, the restored Byzantine Empire faced {{the threat of}} a Latin crusade to reclaim the city. The antagonistic Greek Despotate of Epirus and the Latin states of southern Greece, fearful of the Byzantine resurgence, sought aid from the Kingdom of Sicily, first under Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258–1266), and after 1266 under the ambitious Charles of Anjou (r. 1266–1285), <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> established himself as Byzantium's chief antagonist.

5|$|Forging a {{collaboration}} with Scorsese, the two paired {{again for a}} biopic of the eccentric and obsessive American film director and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004). Centering on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, DiCaprio initially developed the project with Michael Mann, who decided against directing it after back-to-back film biographies in Ali and The Insider. The actor eventually pitched John Logan's script to Scorsese, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> signed on to direct. The Aviator became a critical and financial success. DiCaprio received rave reviews for his performance and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, also receiving another Academy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E

However, Thirty Seconds to Mars also expressed dissatisfaction with the then-recent Terra Firma takeover of EMI, as most of the employees the band had worked with were fired {{as a result of a}} major restructuring under TF chairman Guy Hands. The band were among several of the label's artists, unhappy with the transition, <b>who</b> <b>quickly</b> tried to terminate their contracts; the list also included The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney.
