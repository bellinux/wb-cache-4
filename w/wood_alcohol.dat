5|$|One of the {{activities}} that became synonymous with Belle Vue was speedway (known {{at the time as}} dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the Belle Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on <b>wood</b> <b>alcohol</b> (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E

25|$|Other {{alcohols}} {{are substantially}} more poisonous than ethanol, {{partly because they}} take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic. Methanol (<b>wood</b> <b>alcohol),</b> for instance, is oxidized to formaldehyde {{and then to the}} poisonous formic acid in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase and formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, respectively; accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death. Likewise, poisoning due to other alcohols such as ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol are due to their metabolites, which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, <b>wood</b> <b>alcohol,</b> wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{diethylene glycol}} {{appeared}} to have been added as an adulterant by some Austrian producers of white wines to make them sweeter and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines; production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect. Fortunately, the amount added was not high enough to be toxic except at impossibly high (for most people) levels of consumption (one would have needed to ingest about 28 bottles per day for approximately two weeks in order to suffer fatal effects). Twenty-three people died in 1986 because a fraudulent winemaker in Italy blended toxic methanol (<b>wood</b> <b>alcohol)</b> into his low-alcohol wine to increase its alcohol content.|$|E
50|$|Later, in {{his memoir}} Pieces of My Heart, Wagner {{acknowledged}} {{that he had an}} argument with Wood before she disappeared. The autopsy found that <b>Wood's</b> blood <b>alcohol</b> level was 0.14%, and there were traces of two types of medication in her bloodstream: a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller, both of which increase the effects of alcohol. Following his investigation, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled her death an accident by drowning and hypothermia. According to Noguchi, Wood had been drinking and may have slipped while trying to re-board the dinghy.|$|R
40|$|Catalytic fast {{pyrolysis}} (CFP) of pine <b>wood,</b> <b>alcohols</b> (methanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol and 2 -butanol) and their mixtures with ZSM- 5 catalyst {{were conducted in}} a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The effects of temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the product carbon yields and selectivities of CFP of pure pine wood and methanol were investigated. A maximum carbon yield of petrochemicals (aromatics + C 2 –C 4 olefins + C 5 compounds) from pine wood of 23. 7 % was obtained at a temperature of 600 °C and WHSV of 0. 35 h− 1. A maximum petrochemical yield from methanol of 80. 7 % was obtained at a temperature of 400 °C and WHSV of 0. 35 h− 1. Thus, the optimal conditions for conversion of pine wood and methanol are different. The CFP of pine wood and methanol mixtures was conducted at 450 °C and 500 °C. The hydrogen to carbon effective (H/Ceff) ratio of the feed was adjusted by changing the relative amount of methanol and wood. The petrochemical yield was {{a function of the}} H/Ceff ratio and more petrochemicals are produced from biomass when methanol is added to the CFP process. Co-feeding of 12 C pine wood and 13 C methanol was carried out at 450 °C. The isotopic study showed that all the hydrocarbon products contained mixtures of 12 C and 13 C, indicating that the carbon is mixed within the zeolite. However, the distribution of carbon was skewed depending on the product. The toluene, xylene, propylene and butenes contained more 13 C. The naphthalene and ethylene contain more 12 C. Wood was also co-processed with 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, and 2 -butanol, which showed a similar effect as methanol with an increasing petrochemical yield with an increasing H/Ceff ratio of the feed. This paper demonstrates that CFP can selectively produce a mixture of compounds where the overall yield {{is a function of the}} H/Ceff ratio of the feed...|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} ozone {{treatment}} were investigated {{to improve the}} process of liquefaction of <b>wood</b> with polyhydric <b>alcohol</b> solvents. The liquefied wood having a high <b>wood</b> to polyhydric <b>alcohol</b> ratio (W/P ratio) could be prepared by using the wood treated with ozone in the liquid phase. The liquefied wood with a W/P ratio of 2 [*]:[*] 1 had enough fluidity {{to act as a}} raw material for chemical products. To get some information about the effects of ozone treatment toward the wood components, cellulose powder and steamed lignin were treated with ozone and liquefied. In particular, ozone treatment in the liquid phase was found to be effective for wood and cellulose powder. On the other hand, steamed lignin self-condensed during liquefaction after treatment with ozone in the liquid phase. Thus, ozone treatment provided lignin with reactive functional groups, and caused the subsequent condensation reaction. Although lignin was converted to a more condensable structure by ozone treatment, the condensation reaction was found to be suppressed for wood during its liquefaction. The wood liquefied products displayed good solubilities in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) even after treatments of long duration. It was suggested that one of the main effects of ozone treatment toward wood was the decomposition of cellulose.|$|R
500|$|The fatal {{batch of}} lotion {{involved}} in this mass poisoning was made with methanol (methyl alcohol, <b>wood</b> <b>alcohol,</b> CH3OH), which is poisonous to {{the central nervous system}} {{and other parts of the}} body. Methanol is cheaper than ethanol (ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, CH3CH2OH), the alcohol found in vodka and other alcoholic drinks. The two alcohols are similar in many respects and cannot readily be distinguished. The contents differed from the labels on the bottles, which indicated that they contained ethanol—specifically, [...] "93 percent of ethyl alcohol, hawthorn extract, lemon oil, diethyl phthalate and glycerol".|$|E
2500|$|Methanol, {{also known}} as methyl alcohol among others, is a {{chemical}} with the formula CH3OH (often abbreviated MeOH).

2500|$|In {{the last}} 19th and early 20th century, Amecameca {{was the scene}} of several {{industrialization}} projects including a beer brewery, wheat mills and workshops producing saddles and metal objects. There was some minting of copper, silver and gold as well. [...] In 1871, Father Fortino Hipolito Vera y Talona founded a number of business and cultural enterprises such as the first polytechnic school and a press which printed both religious and cultural articles. Until the Mexican Revolution, most of the arable land in the area was owned by large haciendas such as the Tomacoco, Coapexco and Panoaya. In 1910, Francisco I. Madero was in Amecameca. From a railroad car, he gave a speech against Porfirio Díaz. From 1911 on, the military revolt against the Diaz government was mostly carried out here by Zapatistas, which gained recruits from Amecameca and by 1917, the area was a Zapatista stronghold. The area was important to rebels as it provided materials such as paper, <b>wood,</b> <b>alcohol,</b> charcoal and foodstuffs. After the war, agricultural lands here were redistributed in 1925.|$|E
30|$|In the acetylated sample, {{for all of}} the {{swelling}} liquids, the temperatures at which tanδ began to increase were shifted to lower temperature compared to untreated sample and the degree of reduction in relative E´ increased with increasing temperature. Especially for samples swollen by PrOH and BuOH, tanδ peaks appeared in the measurement temperature range, which were not observed for untreated samples. The peak temperatures differed depending on the kinds of alcohols, which were about 80  °C by PrOH and about 70  °C by BuOH. Relative E´ also decreased greatly with increasing temperature for the wood swollen by PrOH and BuOH. These results show that acetylated <b>wood</b> swollen by <b>alcohols</b> softens at a lower temperature than untreated wood.|$|R

Beech wood samples, which were taken from anonymous mashrabia, have been cleaned mechanically and chemically, then a scanning electron microscope (SEM) study was undertaken, to monitor any significant structural changes in wood samples due to cleaning processes. SEM data, however, show that cleaning procedures, both mechanical and chemical, affect the anatomical structure of wood, and do not achieve the best result.

40|$|In this study, {{mechanical}} properties of <b>wood</b> polymer (beech-furfuryl <b>alcohol)</b> were investigated. In this regard, {{the properties of}} specimens with three different values of furfurylation (20 %, 30 % and 65 %) in comparison with control specimens were evaluated. The furfurylation was carried out with impregnation of specimens with full-cell method followed by polymerization of furfuryl alcohol monomer with heat catalyst. Static bending, tension {{perpendicular to the grain}}, compression parallel and perpendicular to the grain, shear parallel to the grain and hardness of specimens were determined according to ASTM D- 143. Results have shown that with increasing furfurylation, static bending strength increases and tension perpendicular to the grain decreases. In addition, the compression perpendicular to the grain and shear parallel to the grain in specimens with high furfurylation value increases in comparison with control specimens. The radial hardness of the wood polymer sp­ecimens in comparison with control specimens increases greatly and ascendant trend of specimen's hardness was observed being increasing with furfurylation value...|$|R

30|$|Liquefactions of {{cellulose}} powder, steamed lignin, alkali lignin, and their mixtures {{were carried out}} to analyze the reaction process of <b>wood</b> using polyhydric <b>alcohol.</b> The liquefaction of wood proceeded immediately and wood components were converted to N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-soluble components. After that, the condensation reaction occurred with increasing reaction time. However, none {{of cellulose}} powder, steamed lignin, and alkali lignin condensed by themselves during their liquefaction. The mixture of cellulose and lignin was also liquefied, and condensed after a long reaction time. The results of analysis showed that {{the behavior of the}} mixture resembled that of wood with respect to molecular weight distribution and the main functional groups. Lignin was converted to DMF-soluble compounds in the initial stage of wood liquefaction, followed by cellulose gradually being converted into soluble compounds. After that, condensation reactions took place among some parts of depolymerized and degraded compounds from cellulose and lignin, and were converted into DMF-insoluble compounds. It was concluded that the rate-determining step of wood liquefaction was the depolymerization of cellulose. Furthermore, it was suggested that the condensation reaction was due to the mutual reaction among depolymerized cellulose and degraded aromatic derivatives from lignin or due to the nucleophilic displacement reaction of cellulose by phenoxide ion.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the study is birch wood, {{impregnated}} with polyester resin PN- 1 and phenolic alcohols. Resin PN- 1 is a filler, which do not penetrate the cell walls of <b>wood,</b> and phenolic <b>alcohols,</b> on the contrary, represent a class of fillers, which penetrate the cell walls. The degree of impregnation of wood is estimated by coefficient k. When impregnated with resin PN- 1, it is equal to 0. 8, when impregnated with phenolic alcohols – 0. 2. To study the behavior of modified wood in long-term loading the real body is rep-resented as a set of two environments: perfectly elastic, deformable according to Hooke's law, and vis-cous, which obeys Newton's law. As with natural w ood in the description of creep modified birch wood we use rheological equation of Maxwell − Thomson, otherwise, the law of deformation “typical body”. The study of natural birch wood on base of what the modified wood is obtained is accomplished for the subsequent comparison of the rheological characteristics of these two materials. According to the experimental creep curves are defined instant and long elastic moduli, the relaxation time. Using these rheological characteristics, the coefficients of viscosity and modified natural birch wood are calculated. Rheological characteristics of modified wood appeared higher than those of natural wood...|$|R
40|$|Two {{regrowth}} wood species, i. e. tusam (Pinus merkusii Jungh. et de Vr.) and mangium (Acacia mangium Wild.) {{were used}} in this study. Specimens measuring 25 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm and 5 mm x 25 mm x 25 mm were prepared for testing against dry-wood termite (Cryptotermes) and subteranean termite (Coptotermes) respectively. All specimens were air-dried to approxi mately 16 - 18 % moisture content. One group of the specimens was further oven - dried to reach moisture content of 6 - 8 %. Furfurylation {{was carried out by}} soaking wood specimens for 24 hours in a 98 % fuifuryl alcohol solution containing 0. 35 % (v/v) of ZnCl 2 as catalyst. Furfurylated specimens were then cured at l 000 C for 48 hours. Control and treated specimens were exposed to dry-wood and subteranean termites for 12 and 4 weeks respectively. Treated specimens revealed a weight gains of 10 to 40 % depending on size of specimens and wood species. Speciesmens usd for testing drywood termites gained less weight than those of subteranean termites. Tusam specimens markedly showed a higher weight gain than mangium. Furfurylation using method 1 resulted in comparable weight gain to that of method 2. Control specimens of tusam an mangium are both encountered susceptible to dry-wood and subteranean termite attacts. Tusam had less initial durability against Coptotermes than mangium, but the wood species had a similar durability against Cryptotermess. The modified <b>wood</b> with furfuryl <b>alcohol</b> abviously possessed an improved durability upon the two termites. Tusam specimens gained more durability improvement than mangium...|$|R
