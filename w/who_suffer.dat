5|$|In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a culture-bound {{syndrome}} {{unique to}} Japanese culture. Those <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from the condition {{believe they are}} possessed by a fox. Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy.|$|E
5|$|Most people recover uneventfully {{following}} a mild local reaction {{and up to}} about 3% of individuals suffer a severe localised reaction. Most individuals <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from severe localised reactions will most likely encounter another reaction if stung again. Fatalities are rare, and venom immunotherapy can prevent fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but {{the trauma of}} seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
