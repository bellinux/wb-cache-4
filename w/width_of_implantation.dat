For this purpose 360 keV xenon ions were implanted in commercial 6 H-SiC and CVD-SiC wafers at room temperature, 350 °C and 600 °C. <b>Width</b> broadening <b>of</b> the <b>implantation</b> profiles and xenon retention during isochronal and isothermal annealing up to temperatures of 1500 °C was determined by RBS-analysis, whilst {{in the case of}} 6 H-SiC damage profiles were simultaneously obtained by aparticle channelling. No diffusion or xenon loss was detected in the initially amorphized and eventually recrystallized surface layer of cold implanted 6 H-SiC during annealing up to 1200 °C. Above that temperature serious erosion of the implanted surface occurred, which made any analysis impossible. No diffusion or xenon loss is detected in the hot implanted 6 H-SiC samples during annealing up to 1400 °C. Radiation damage dependent grain boundary diffusion is observed at 1300 °C in CVD-SiC.

40|$|Diffusion {{of heavy}} noble gas atoms in {{irradiation}} damaged single crystalline silicon carbide and the thermal etching {{of it is}} investigated at temperatures of 1300 C and 1400 C. For this purpose 360 keV krypton and xenon ions were implanted in commercial 6 H-SiC wafers at 600 C, which is far above the critical amorphization temperature of the target material. <b>Width</b> broadening <b>of</b> the <b>implantation</b> profiles and the retention of krypton and xenon during isothermal annealing was determined by RBS-analysis, whilst damage profiles were simultaneously obtained by a-particle channelling. No diffusion and no loss of the implanted species is detected in the implanted samples after isothermal annealing for 40 h at 1400 C. However, thermal etching of the target material is observed at both annealing temperatures and leads at 1400 C to a significant shift <b>of</b> the <b>implantation</b> profile towards the surface due to sublimation. RBS analysis shows that this occurs mainly during the initial stage of isothermal annealing, while surface loss during prolonged annealing is minimal. The resulting topographical modification of the surface during annealing was studied by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. It indicates that the observed phenomenon {{is due to a}} relatively strong dependence of thermal etching on the defect density in the surface region, while the evolving surface roughness seems not to play a decisive role.

40|$|Diffusion of krypton in poly {{and single}} {{crystalline}} silicon carbide is investigated and {{compared with the}} previously obtained results for xenon, which pointed to a different diffusion mechanism than observed for chemically active elements. For this purpose 360 keV krypton ions were implanted in commercial 6 H-SiC and CVD-SiC wafers at room temperature, 350 °C and 600 °C. <b>Width</b> broadening <b>of</b> the <b>implantation</b> profiles and krypton retention during isochronal and isothermal annealing up to temperatures of 1400 °C was determined by RBS-analysis, whilst {{in the case of}} 6 H-SiC damage profiles were simultaneously obtained by α- particle channelling. Little diffusion and no krypton loss was detected in the initially amorphized and eventually recrystallized surface layer of cold implanted 6 H-SiC during annealing up to 1200 °C. Above that temperature thermal etching of the implanted surface became increasingly important. No diffusion or krypton loss is detected in the hot implanted 6 H-SiC samples during annealing up to 1400 °C. Radiation damage dependent grain boundary diffusion is observed at 1300 C in CVD-SiC. The results seem to indicate, that the chemically inert noble gas atoms do not form defect-impurity complexes, which strongly influence the diffusion behaviour of other diffusors in silicon carbide.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cell signalling in many physiological systems, including reproduction. During pregnancy, oestrogen modulates uterine NO generation, and NO may play an intermediary role in the oestrogen-mediated effects on the uterus. Since oestrogen is actively involved in inducing endometrial receptivity to support the process <b>of</b> <b>implantation,</b> the role <b>of</b> NO in the process <b>of</b> <b>implantation</b> in rats was investigated. N=wnitro-l-argininemethyl ester (l-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), was administered in utero with or without sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a generator of NO, on different days during the preimplantation phase of gestation. The status of gestation in respect <b>of</b> <b>implantation</b> failure, endometrial receptivity and embryo development were assessed. l-NAME was administered at various doses (2 =n-mg per uterine horn) and on different days of pregnancy (days 2 =n-of pregnancy) to optimize the pregnancy terminating dose (absence <b>of</b> <b>implantation</b> site on day 8 of pregnancy) and the effective day of treatment. l-NAME led to failure <b>of</b> <b>implantation</b> when administered at 2. 5 mg per uterine horn on day 3 of pregnancy. The characteristic preimplantation permeability changes in the uterus were significantly attenuated and embryo growth was retarded. The l-NAME-mediated effects were significantly reversed when SNP (100 =m) was co-administered with l-NAME. These findings suggest a role for NO in the process <b>of</b> <b>implantation.</b> The possible mechanism by which inhibition of the NO=n- system may interfere with implantation is discussed...|$|R
