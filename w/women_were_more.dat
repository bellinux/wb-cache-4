5|$|A public {{survey in}} October 2008 {{revealed}} 62% of adults would vote Yes in a referendum to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples. A {{breakdown of the}} results shows that support is strongest among younger people and in urban areas. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> supportive at 68% compared to 56% of men. There was slightly less support for same-sex couples being given the right to adopt. A total of 58% of those under 50 believe same-sex couples {{should be able to}} adopt, falling to 33% among the over-50s. A total of 54% believe the definition of the family unit in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include same-sex families.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E

25|$|Ethnicity and {{geography}} play {{roles in the}} experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to report vasomotor symptoms.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent studies}} {{indicate}} that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age. In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more. In terms of blogs, men {{were more likely to}} blog in the first place; among those who blog, men {{were more likely to have}} a professional blog, whereas <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to have a personal blog.|$|E
50|$|Occupational {{distribution}} varies {{for women}} of various races as well. White and Asian <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to work in managerial and professional occupations, while black, Hispanic, and American Indian <b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to work in service occupations. Thus, because certain races <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to have lower-paying jobs, gaps in median incomes between races arise.|$|R

25|$|The {{introduction}} of {{women into the}} Corps doubled the number of uniforms, as women had an equivalent for every male uniform. After the war, female uniforms became close to their male equivalents as <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> closely integrated into the Corps, and the green service uniform was worn year-round as the khaki summer version was discontinued. In the late 1980s, the full white dress uniform coat was discontinued, though the white dress trousers remain in use for ceremonial units today.|$|E
25|$|DV {{is among}} the most underreported crimes {{worldwide}} for both men and women. A 2011 review article by intimate partner violence researcher Ko Ling Chan found men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to under-report their victimization and over-estimate their own violence perpetration. Financial or familial dependence, normalization of violence, and self-blaming were found to reduce the likelihood of self-reporting victimization in women. By contrast, fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their own needs and emotions reduced the likelihood of self-reporting perpetration in men.|$|E
25|$|Gender-specific theory {{developed}} in the Malleus Maleficarum laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches. Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with the Malleus {{but none of them}} challenged the view that <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> inclined to be witches than men. It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.|$|E

25|$|An April 2011 poll of 2,000 British adults {{found that}} 35% {{of the public}} {{intended}} to watch the wedding on television while an equal proportion planned to ignore the event altogether. According to their reported plans, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> {{than twice as likely}} (47%) to watch the event as men (23%). Early estimates following the ceremony indicated an estimated 24.5 million people in the United Kingdom watched the wedding on either BBC One or ITV, giving those channels a 99.4% share of the terrestrial television audience as the service began, with the BBC's Live royal wedding website having 9 million hits, estimating over half the British population watched the wedding.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Claus Wedekind {{found that}} {{in a group of}} female college {{students}} who smelled T-shirts worn by male students for two nights (without deodorant, cologne, or scented soaps), by far most women chose shirts worn by men of dissimilar MHCs, a preference reversed if the women were on oral contraceptives. Results of a 2002 experiment likewise suggest HLA-associated odors influence odor preference and may mediate social cues. In 2005 in a group of 58 subjects, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> indecisive when presented with MHCs like their own, although with oral contraceptives, the women showed no particular preference. No studies show the extent to which odor preference determines mate selection (or vice versa).|$|E
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely than men to identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; {{it is a way}} of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|The {{women of}} Nicaragua prior to, {{during and after}} the {{revolution}} played a prominent role within the nation's society as they have commonly been recognized, throughout history and across all Latin American states, as its backbone. Nicaraguan women were therefore directly affected by all of the positive and negative events that took place during this revolutionary period. The victory of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1979 brought about major changes and gains for women, mainly in legislation, broad educational opportunities, training programs for working women, childcare programs to help women enter the work force and greatly increased participation and leadership positions in a range of political activities. This, in turn, reduced the burdens that the women of Nicaragua were faced with prior to the revolution. During the Sandinista government, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> active politically. The large majority of members of the neighborhood committees (Comités de Defensa Sandinista) were women. By 1987, 31% of the executive positions in the Sandinista government, 27% of the leadership positions of the FSLN, and 25% of the FSLN's active membership were women.|$|E
25|$|However, {{other studies}} have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and Austria (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that {{although}} people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter {{were more likely to}} die in the months further from their birthday. A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect. A small study by Leonard Zusne found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole. The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but it was not seen in the population as a whole.|$|E
