40|$|Premise of the study: Analyses {{of genetic}} {{structure}} and phylogenetic relationships illuminate {{the origin and}} domestication of modern crops. Despite being an important worldwide vegetable, the genetic structure and domestication of carrot (Daucus carota) is poorly understood. We provide the first such study using a large data set of molecular markers and accessions that are widely dispersed around the world. • Methods: Sequencing data from the carrot transcriptome were used to develop 4000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Eighty-four genotypes, including a geographically well-distributed subset of <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>carrots,</b> were genotyped using the KASPar assay. • Key results: Analysis of allelic diversity of SNP data revealed no reduction of genetic diversity in cultivated vs. wild accessions. Structure and phylogenetic analysis indicated a clear separation between wild and cultivated accessions {{as well as between}} eastern and western cultivated <b>carrot.</b> Among the <b>wild</b> <b>carrots,</b> those from Central Asia were genetically most similar to cultivated accessions. Furthermore, we found that <b>wild</b> <b>carrots</b> from North America were most closely related to European wild accessions. • Conclusions: Comparing the genetic diversity of wild and cultivated accessions suggested the absence of a genetic bottleneck during carrot domestication. In conjunction with historical documents, our results suggest an origin of domesticated carrot in Central Asia. <b>Wild</b> <b>carrots</b> from North America were likely introduced as weeds with European colonization. These results provide answers to long-debated questions of carrot evolution and domestication and inform germplasm curators and breeders on genetic substructure of carrot genetic resources...|$|R

60|$|Finally, {{every one}} must judge for himself {{whether it is}} more {{probable}} that the several forms of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are descended from between ten and fifteen species, {{most of which are}} now either unknown or extinct, or whether they are descended from between four and eight species, which may have either closely resembled our present cultivated forms, or have been so widely different as to escape identification. In this latter case we must conclude that man cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period, and that he formerly practised some degree of selection, which in itself is not improbable.

The inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely collected wild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of roses, elderberries, beechmast, and other wild berries and fruit. (9/8. Prof. O.

40|$|Radioactivity {{released}} from disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima {{is a global}} hazard and a threat to exposed biota. To minimize the deleterious effects of stressors organisms adopt various strategies. Plants, for example, may delay germination or stay dormant during stressful periods. However, an intense stress may halt germination or heavily affect various developmental stages and select for life history changes. Here, we test for the consequence of exposure to ionizing radiation on plant development. We conducted a common garden experiment in an uncontaminated greenhouse using 660 seeds originating from 33 <b>wild</b> <b>carrots</b> (Daucus carota) collected near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. These maternal plants {{had been exposed to}} radiation levels that varied by three orders of magnitude. We found strong negative effects of elevated radiation on the timing and rates of seed germination. In addition, later stages of development and the timing of emergence of consecutive leaves were delayed by exposure to radiation. We hypothesize that low quality of resources stored in seeds, damaged DNA, or both, delayed development and halted germination of seeds from plants exposed to elevated levels of ionizing radiation. We propose that high levels of spatial heterogeneity in background radiation may hamper adaptive life history responses...|$|R
60|$|This latter plant, in its {{cultivated}} state, differs in scarcely any {{character from}} the <b>wild</b> English <b>carrot,</b> except in general luxuriance {{and in the}} size and quality of its roots; but ten varieties, differing in the colour, shape, {{and quality of the}} root, are cultivated in England and come true by seed.

Hence with the carrot, as in so many other cases, for instance with the numerous varieties and sub-varieties of the radish, that part of the plant which is valued by man, falsely appears alone to have varied. The truth is that variations in this part alone have been selected; and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to vary in the same way, analogous modifications have been again and again selected, until at last a great amount of change has been effected.|$|R

Over all flutter myriads of light-yellow butterflies, mostly skimming along the surface, dipping and oscillating, giving a curious animation to the scene. The beautiful, spiritual insects! straw-color'd Psyches! Occasionally one of them leaves his mates, and mounts, perhaps spirally, perhaps {{in a straight line}} in the air, fluttering up, up, till literally out of sight. In the lane as I came along just now I noticed one spot, ten feet square or so, where more than a hundred had collected, holding a revel, a gyration-dance, or butterfly good-time, winding and circling, down and across, but always keeping within the limits. The little creatures have come out {{all of a sudden the}} last few days, and are now very plentiful. As I sit outdoors, or walk, I hardly look around without somewhere seeing two (always two) fluttering through the air in amorous dalliance. Then their inimitable color, their fragility, peculiar motion--and that strange, frequent way of one leaving the crowd and mounting up, up in the free ether, and apparently never returning. As I look over the field, these yellow-wings everywhere mildly sparkling, many snowy blossoms of the <b>wild</b> <b>carrot</b> gracefully bending on their tall and taper stems--while for sounds, the distant guttural screech of a flock of guinea-hens comes shrilly yet somehow musically to my ears.

30|$|The Umbelliferae (apiaceous plants) {{are known}} for the {{presence}} of saponins, sesquiterpene lactones, coumarins, flavone glucosides, tanins and a broad range of volatiles. The family has been previously discussed in this review series under the Apiaceae [14], but we further highlight herein some species that {{were not included in the}} previous review and provide a more in-depth discussion of this family. Plants of the genus Daucus have been used by natives of some Northern African countries as diuretics, emollient, vermifuge, carminative and against stomach ache [98, 99], some of the species having edible roots, e.g. Daucus carota [100]. Salam et al. identified six new sesquiterpene lactone esters; daucoguaianolactones A–F (131 – 136), and one new sesquiterpene lactone; daucoeudesmanolactone A (137) from the leaves and stems of Daucus glaber [101], along with the known sesquiterpene lactones talasins A and B and badkhysin. Bioactivity assessment showed that compounds 134, 137, and talasins A and B showed moderate cytotoxicity against P- 388 leukemia cells [101]. From the leaves and stems of the same species, Sallam et al. also isolated three new phenylpropanoid triesters, glaberins A–C (138 – 140), compounds 138 and 139 showing cytotoxicity against P- 388 murine lymphocytic leukemia cells with respective IC 50 values of 55 and 44  µg/mL [102]. Ahmed et al. rather isolated rare trisubstituted sesquiterpenes daucanes (141 – 144) from the sister species D. carota, collected from the wild [103]. The isolated compounds also included the polyacetylene falcarindiol (145) and the sesquiterpene coumarin ferulenol (146). The assessment of the antimicrobial activities of these compounds showed that the MIC values for 141 and 142 were < 2  mg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces scabies, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus as well as the gram negative species Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Meanwhile, compound 146 had an estimated MIC <  2.5  mg/mL against S. aureus, S. scabies, B. subtilis, B. cereus and P. aeroginosa and within the range 5  mg/mL < MIC <  4.5  mg/mL against E. coli, F. oxysporum and A. niger. Compounds 144 and 145 had MIC values < 2.5  mg/mL against all the above tested microorganisms but showed no antibacterial effect against F. oxysporum and E. coli [103]. These results are in accordance with the use of <b>wild</b> <b>carrots</b> in traditional medicine; extract of the plant are used traditionally for the treatment of hepatic and renal insufficiency as well as for skin disorders (microbial infections) [104], while the extracts of the wild plants are also known to exhibit antioxidative and iron-chelative properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{the first}} pathway-specific enzyme in {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis, phytoene synthase (PSY) {{is a prime}} regulatory target. This includes a number of biotechnological approaches that have successfully increased the carotenoid content in agronomically relevant non-green plant tissues through tissue-specific PSY overexpression. We investigated the differential effects of constitutive AtPSY overexpression in green and non-green cells of transgenic Arabidopsis lines. This revealed striking similarities to the situation found in orange carrot roots with respect to carotenoid amounts and sequestration mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Arabidopsis seedlings, carotenoid content remained unaffected by increased AtPSY levels although the protein was almost quantitatively imported into plastids, as shown by western blot analyses. In contrast, non-photosynthetic calli and roots overexpressing AtPSY accumulated carotenoids 10 and 100 -fold above the corresponding wild-type tissues and contained 1800 and 500 microg carotenoids per g dry weight, respectively. This increase coincided with a change of the pattern of accumulated carotenoids, as xanthophylls decreased relative to beta-carotene and carotene intermediates accumulated. As shown by polarization microscopy, carotenoids were found deposited in crystals, similar to crystalline-type chromoplasts of non-green tissues present in several other taxa. In fact, orange-colored carrots showed a similar situation with increased PSY protein as well as carotenoid levels and accumulation patterns whereas <b>wild</b> white-rooted <b>carrots</b> were similar to Arabidopsis wild type roots in this respect. Initiation of carotenoid crystal formation by increased PSY protein amounts was further confirmed by overexpressing crtB, a bacterial PSY gene, in white carrots, resulting in increased carotenoid amounts deposited in crystals. CONCLUSIONS: The sequestration of carotenoids into crystals can be driven by the functional overexpression of one biosynthetic enzyme in non-green plastids not requiring a chromoplast developmental program as this {{does not exist in}} Arabidopsis. Thus, PSY expression plays a major, rate-limiting role in the transition from white to orange-colored carrots...|$|R
6000|$|When we {{have with}} {{difficulty}} made our selection from the divine redundancy of the ideal world, and {{so far as we}} could have reduced ourselves to the penury of a sole possession, why do not we turn our eyes to the example of Nature in not only bringing forth a hundred or a thousand fold of the kind of seed planted, but in accompanying its growth with that of an endless variety of other plants, all coming to bear in a like profusion?

There, too, art having chosen a kind brings it to bear with all the other kinds which have been lurking in the unconscious soil of the mind and only waiting tilth for any purpose before springing up in company with the selected seed. This is what makes the poets and novelists and dramatists so much more profitable reading than the moralists. From whom, indeed, has the vital wisdom of the race been garnered? Not from those hard, ethical masters who have sought to narrow culture to the business of growing precepts, but from the genial teachers who have inculcated amusement and breathed into the unwary mind some inspiration which escaped as unconsciously from themselves.

He handed over a long list of deaths from heat that enlivened the newspapers. All the cities where men live at breaking-strain were sending in their butcher-bills, and the papers of the cities, themselves apostles of the Gospel of Rush, were beseeching their readers to keep cool and not to overwork themselves while the hot wave was upon them. The rivers were patched and barred with sun-dried pebbles; the logs and loggers were drought-bound somewhere up the Connecticut; and the grass {{at the side of the}} track was burned in a hundred places by the sparks from locomotives. Men--hatless, coatless, and gasping--lay in the shade of that station where only a few months ago the glass stood at 30 below zero. Now the readings were 98 degrees in the shade. Main Street--do you remember Main Street of a little village locked up in the snow this spring?[2]--had given up the business of life, and an American flag with some politician's name printed across the bottom hung down across the street as stiff as a board. There were men with fans and alpaca coats curled up in splint chairs in the verandah of the one hotel--among them an ex-President of the United States. He completed the impression that the furniture of the entire country had been turned out of doors for summer cleaning in the absence of all the inhabitants. Nothing looks so hopelessly 'ex' as a President 'returned to stores,' The stars and stripes signified that the Presidential Campaign had opened in Main Street--opened and shut up again. Politics evaporate at summer heat when all hands are busy with the last of the hay, and, as the formers put it, 'Vermont's bound to go Republican.' The custom of the land is to drag the scuffle and dust of an election over several months--to the improvement of business and manners; but the noise of that war comes faintly up the valley of the Connecticut and is lost among the fiddling of the locusts. Their music puts, as it were, a knife edge upon the heat of the day. In truth, it is a tropical country for the time being. Thunder-storms prowl and growl round the belted hills, spit themselves away in a few drops of rain, and leave the air more dead than before. In the woods, where even the faithful springs are beginning to run low, the pines and balsams have thrown out all their fragrance upon the heat and wait for the wind to bring news of the rain. The clematis, <b>wild</b> <b>carrot,</b> and all the gipsy-flowers camped by sufferance between fence line and road net are masked in white dust, and the golden-rod of the pastures that are burned to flax-colour burns too like burnished brass. A pillar of dust on the long hog-back of the road across the hills shows where a team is lathering between farms, and the roofs of the wooden houses flicker in the haze of their own heat. Overhead the chicken-hawk is the only creature at work, and his shrill kite-like call sends the gaping chickens from the dust-bath in haste to their mothers. The red squirrel as usual feigns business of importance among the butternuts, but this is pure priggishness. When the passer-by is gone he ceases chattering and climbs back to where the little breezes can stir his tail-plumes. From somewhere under the lazy fold of a meadow comes the drone of a mowing-machine among the hay--its whurr-oo and the grunt of the tired horses.|$|E

It is similar in {{appearance}} to other species and subspecies of <b>wild</b> <b>carrot,</b> with umbels of white or pinkish flowers.|$|E
6000|$|It may be {{presumed that}} all animals which feed on various {{substances}} possess {{the sense of}} taste, and this is certainly the case with worms. Cabbage-leaves are much liked by worms; {{and it appears that}} they can distinguish between different varieties; but this may perhaps be owing to differences in their texture. On eleven occasions pieces of the fresh leaves of a common green variety and of the red variety used for pickling were given them, and they preferred the green, the red being either wholly neglected or much less gnawed. On two other occasions, however, they seemed to prefer the red. Half-decayed leaves of the red variety and fresh leaves of the green were attacked about equally. When leaves of the cabbage, horse-radish (a favourite food) and of the onion were given together, the latter were always, and manifestly preferred. Leaves of the cabbage, lime-tree, Ampelopsis, parsnip (Pastinaca), and celery (Apium) were likewise given together; and those of the celery were first eaten. But when leaves of cabbage, turnip, beet, celery, <b>wild</b> cherry and <b>carrots</b> were given together, the two latter kinds, especially those of the carrot, were preferred to all the others, including those of celery. It was also manifest after many trials that wild cherry leaves were greatly preferred to those of the lime-tree and hazel (Corylus). [...] According to Mr. Bridgman the half-decayed leaves of Phlox verna are particularly liked by worms. {16} ...|$|R
