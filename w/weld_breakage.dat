40|$|Abstract—One of {{the main}} trouble in a steel strip {{manufacturing}} line is the breakage of whatever weld carried out between steel coils, {{that are used to}} produce the continuous strip to be processed. A <b>weld</b> <b>breakage</b> results in a several hours stop of the manufacturing line. In this process the damages caused by the breakage must be repaired. After the reparation and in order to go on with the production it will be necessary a restarting process of the line. For minimizing this problem, a human operator must inspect visually and manually each weld in order to avoid its breakage during the manufacturing process. The work presented in this paper is based on the Bayesian decision theory and it presents an approach to detect, on real−time, steel strip defective welds. This approach is based on quantifying the tradeoffs between various classification decisions using probability and the costs that accompany such decisions...|$|E
40|$|In some steel {{production}} lines the strips {{coming from the}} successive coils are welded {{in order to obtain}} an infinite strip. In such industrial plants, welding is a critical task, because of the costs induced by a <b>weld</b> <b>breakage</b> on the line. Currently, the weld quality is estimated by the operator, by visualising it and making a hammer test. This paper proposes an automatic method for improving the diagnosis of seam weld. The proposed methodology is divided into two parts. The first one consists in assessing the weld by means of indicators computed from the evolution of the process variables. These indicators are then compared to thresholds which are systematically determined thanks to a database corresponding to thousands of welds. The second part deals with the detection of weld opening and centring problems by means of indicators obtained from the position measurements and the strip widths. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
5000|$|... "Daisy cutter" [...] fuses, when known {{under that}} exact name, were first {{used by the}} United States during the Vietnam War. The concept for the fuse is {{attributed}} to an Air America employee who grasped the idea during a night of drinking. Shortly thereafter, his drinking buddy, a Royal Lao Air Force airman at Louang Phrabang, gathered the needed materials for the prototype and started welding used aircraft gun barrels directly into the nose fuse cavity of bombs. After the concept proved itself useful it was made famous by being used for the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal at the time, the BLU-82. When used gun barrels were in short supply, water pipes were requisitioned for the task. The welded pipe versions had several adverse effects, such as vibration, pipe <b>weld</b> separation or <b>breakage</b> while in flight, and wind drag, due to impossibility of aligning the pipes correctly with {{the nose of the}} weapon, so that phase of development eventually gave way to threaded steel water pipes screwed into the nose cavity of the bombs, leaving only the tail fuse for detonation. After the war more precise fuses were created for this purpose. These weapons were used in the [...] "shock and awe" [...] phase of the Iraq War.|$|R
