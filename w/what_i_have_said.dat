The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the tour}} Ranji and Stoddart had made disparaging {{comments}} about Australian crowds in the Australian press, which ensured the matches were played amongst great rancour. Stoddart wrote, [...] "I shall, in all probability, never visit this country {{again with a}} cricket team, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> has been purely {{for the good of}} the game, for the sake of the players in this country, and of English teams coming out here in the future." [...] Stoddart never did tour Australia again, although at the tour's end Ranji did send an apology, and his popularity did not suffer so much as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes married Kate Murphy of San Antonio (d. 1980) in 1910. In 1981 Holocaust denier David Irving {{claimed that}} Hughes {{had a girlfriend}} whom he {{referred}} to as “JP” in his diary. Recent research has discovered that “JP” refers to Elizabeth Prismall, who was a British secretary on Hughes’ staff. The nature of their relationship was indeed close, but {{it is by no}} means certain that the two were having an affair. Hughes, of his own volition, informed Kate of Mrs. Prismall’s presence explaining in a letter dated March 8, 1943, [...] "I have taken Mrs. Prismall to the mess several times and during the past few days….So you’ll soon here [...] that Hughes has a girl friend [...] along with the rest. But don’t put the wrong interpretation on anything you hear or on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> unless you want to make yourself unhappy.” ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{many years}} Grant stood by his {{original}} {{version of the}} orders to Wallace. As late as 1884, when Grant wrote an article on Shiloh for The Century Magazine that appeared in its February 1885 issue, he maintained that Wallace had taken the wrong road {{on the first day}} of battle. After W. H. L. Wallace's widow gave Grant a letter that Lew Wallace had written to her the day before the battle (the one indicating his plans to use the Shunpike road to pass between Shiloh and his position west of Crump's Landing), Grant changed his mind. Grant wrote a letter to the editors at Century, which was published in its September 1885 issue, and added a note to his memoirs to explain that Wallace's letter [...] "modifies very materially <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> and what has been said by others, about the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh." [...] While reaffirming that he had ordered Wallace to take the River Road, Grant stated that he could not be sure the exact content of Wallace's written orders, since his verbal orders were given to one of his aides and transcribed.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 November, in an {{interview}} with TIME magazine [...] Morsi said of his 22 November constitutional declaration: [...] "If we had a constitution, then all of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> or done last week, will stop.... when we have a constitution, what I have issued will stop immediately.... The Constituent Assembly of Egypt rushed to finish its work amid widespread protests against Morsi and his declaration. The rush toward a new constitution spurred a walkout among its drafters, i.e. liberals, human rights activists, and others who were unsatisfied with a range of provisions dealing with {{the role of religion in}} the state, the status of women, and the privileges accorded to the country's army. According to the BBC's Jon Leybe the move was designed to preempt a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on 2 December, which might once again dissolve the assembly. The Brotherhood hoped that the decree replaced by a completely new constitution would be approved on a referendum and put an end to the unrest. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. Dozens of police officers, backed by trucks firing tear gas, arrested numerous protesters, some of whom were beaten by officers as others continued to throw stones at police. The Brotherhood organized counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted a few thousand participants. As protests mounted over Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers until the text of the constitution was ratified in a referendum, the panel tasked with writing the constitution wrapped up its deliberations on Wednesday and readied for a vote on Thursday. By 28 November two more people were killed and hundreds more injured. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, the Cairo Appeals Court, and other appeals courts suspended their work until Morsi's decree is rescinded.|$|E
