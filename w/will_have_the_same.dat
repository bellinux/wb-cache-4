5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence class <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of}} the equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> underage laws {{as the state}} that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations {{that take place in}} federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry equivalence class. Begin with a valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This {{is not a}} valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process {{can be used to}} build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would be quite a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of âˆ’1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E
