5|$|Scheele {{and other}} chemists <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{manganese}} dioxide contained a new element, {{but they were}} not able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|The Germans <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the British paratroopers had {{dismantled}} {{the explosive}} charges attached to Primosole Bridge, and now attempted {{to destroy it}} by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it. This was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, {{in a final}} patriotic gesture, he played {{for the benefit of}} Polish refugees. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45kg), and his doctors <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> his sickness was at a terminal stage.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> your hand <b>is</b> resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.|$|R

5|$|Earlier in the day, an FAA {{specialist}} {{had informed}} the crew {{that it would}} be illegal to land at night in Aspen under instrument flight rules. In addition, the crew <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at Aspen by the 18:58 MST night curfew. Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the curfew took effect.|$|E
5|$|General Vandegrift and {{his staff}} <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that {{numerous}} groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct {{a series of small}} unit operations around the Matanikau Valley.|$|E
5|$|The British {{preparations}} {{could not}} be made in secret, and by March 1915, the Turks <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> a force of fifty thousand British and thirty thousand French troops was gathering at Lemnos. They considered there were only four likely places for them to land: Cape Helles, Gaba Tepe, Bulair, or on the Asiatic (eastern) coast of the Dardanelles.|$|E

5|$|Waddington {{was married}} twice. In 1925, he married Mabel Fawell; {{none of his}} Yorkshire {{teammates}} <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he was getting married. In 1952, he married Doris Garforth; on this occasion, many of his former cricketing colleagues attended. After a long illness, Waddington died in a Scarborough nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66. He was cremated in Bradford.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|From 1527 onwards the Spanish were {{increasingly}} {{active in the}} Yucatán Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including Campeche and Valladolid {{in what is now}} Mexico. The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Petén Itzá, within the modern borders of Guatemala. The Spanish <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the slow Spanish advance.|$|E

5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the IRA {{was planning}} to detonate a bomb at {{the changing of the}} guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} its new offensive, the North Korean command decided {{any attempt}} to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to {{the support of the}} UN navy. Instead, they opted to use a frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed with intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E

In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{was born}} at Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth of five children.

5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{a raid on}} the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Itza Maya {{had become}} the centre of anti-Spanish {{resistance}} and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes {{over the course of}} almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the Spanish advance. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases.|$|E

It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, would be prepared for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E
