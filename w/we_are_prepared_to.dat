We will use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of our present year, this plantation was, in compliance with an order of our Post Commander, deprived of horses, mules, oxen and farming utensils of every description, very much {{of which had been}} captured and brought into Union lines by the undersigned; in consequence of which deprivations, we were, of course, reduced to the necessity of buying everything necessary for farming, and having thus far succeeded in performing by far the most expensive and laborious part of our work, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accomplish the ginning, pressing, weighing, marking, consigning, etc., in a business-like order if allowed to do so.|$|E
500|$|Greenfield became Premier {{at a time}} of {{agricultural}} depression, especially in the province's south. [...] The region, which was responsible for approximately 75% of Alberta's wheat production, {{was in the midst of}} its fifth consecutive year of drought, and the farmers who had been responsible for putting the UFA into office were now demanding action. [...] Initially, the government offered direct financial assistance, with $5 million provided in seed and grain relief by the end of 1922. [...] However, this effort was driving the province close to bankruptcy, and in 1923 Greenfield announced an end to the handouts (the bill authorizing the last of these was a source of chagrin for MLAs from all parties, both because it marked the end of direct assistance for farmers and because the last of the assistance was itself so expensive). [...] Farmers and political representatives from the affected areas criticized the government bitterly, referencing Greenfield's earlier pledge that [...] "if the south country should fall, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> fall with it".|$|E

2500|$|... {{estimated}} … {{two hundred}} thousand sonnets were written in Europe between 1530 and 1650. The topic of most of them was love.

2500|$|The State Department also {{concluded}} that [...] "we {{are all too}} {{well aware of the}} unpleasant fact that Communist Ho Chi Minh is the strongest and perhaps the ablest figure in Indochina and that any suggested solution which excludes him is an expedient of uncertain outcome.

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} on 31 January 2003, Bush again reiterated that the single trigger for the {{invasion}} would be Iraq's failure to disarm, [...] "Saddam Hussein must understand {{that if he does}} not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein." [...] As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm. As Blair made clear in a statement to the House of Commons, [...] "I detest his regime. But even now he can save it by complying with the UN's demand. Even now, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2011 the Sydney Morning Herald {{published}} an article in which a New Zealand physicist and information from Phar Lap's strapper state that the great horse was never given any tonic with arsenic and that he died of an infection. Said Dr. Putt, [...] "Unless <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> say that Tommy Woodcock was a downright liar, which even today, decades after the loveable and respected horseman's death, would ostracise us with the Australian racing public, we must accept him on his word.

2500|$|Mackenzie, Duncombe, John Rolph and 200 {{supporters}} fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River, {{where they}} declared themselves the Republic of Canada on December 13. They obtained supplies from {{supporters in the}} United States, resulting in British reprisals (see Caroline affair). On January 13, 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States where {{he was arrested and}} charged under the Neutrality Act. The other major leaders, Van Egmond, Samuel Lount, and Peter Matthews were arrested by the British; Van Egmond died in prison, and Lount and Matthews were executed at 8 AM on April 12, 1838, in Toronto. Their last words were: [...] "Mr. Jarvis, do your duty; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> meet death and our Judge." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Archbishop Ntagali {{disapproved of}} the Church of England's {{decision}} to allow clergy in civil partnerships to become bishops. He said, [...] "It is very discouraging {{to hear that the}} Church of England, which once brought the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Uganda, has taken such a significant step away from that very gospel that brought life, light, and hope to us." [...] Archbishop Ntagali also reiterated his opposition to similar decisions made by other western Anglican provinces. “Sadly we must also declare that if the Church of England continues in this contrary direction we must further separate ourselves from it and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take the same actions as those prompted by the decisions of The Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada ten years ago.” ...|$|E

In his announcement, McCain emphasized that [...] "America should never undertake a war unless <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do everything necessary to succeed," [...] and he also stated that, [...] "I'm not running for President to be somebody, but to do something; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things." [...] The audience was somewhat listless. He then visited Saint Anselm College and several other spots around Manchester, New Hampshire on a cold rainy day, before starting a planned three-day campaign rally in South Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|The British Government, in authorising {{the letters}} {{despatched}} to King Hussein [...] before {{the outbreak of}} the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 4 August 1914, Asquith proposed a Suspensory Bill for the Home Rule Bill. It received Royal Assent simultaneously with its counterpart, the Government of Ireland Act 1914, on the 18 September. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed {{for the duration of}} the conflict. [...] In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O'Brien made it again clear [...] "that while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some of us, at all events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation". He concluded by turning to 'our fellow countrymen in Ulster' in proposing to secure for them a position of undiminished citizenship in this Empire under some projected scheme of federalism.|$|E

2500|$|Nehru, while a pacifist, was not {{blind to}} the {{political}} and geostrategic reality of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, he stated: [...] "We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, {{we have to face}} all contingencies, and unless <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> face them, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defense methods and a well-equipped army, navy and air force." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 3, 1872, 46 Armenians come {{together}} to build “Union of Salvation (Armenian)” (different from the Russian Union of Salvation).

If the alternative to our present condition is to become Russified, let us be Russified together; {{if it is to be}} emigration, let us emigrate; if we are to die, let us die” This organization had not only direct contact with the Russian government but with certain Russian organization. These Russian organizations had goals to liberate the Ottoman Armenians from Ottoman Empire. [...] Union of Salvation served a major step toward the formation of the first Armenian political party, the Armenakan.|$|E
