5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna {{do it with}} you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he snarled, [...] "I suppose I gotta {{give you}} cheap skates a drink <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>got</b> more'n {{enough for a}} good {{petrification}} for myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Wood. I find we two shall scarce agree: I {{must not}} come to your closet <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> a bottle; for, at such a time, I am horribly given to it.|$|R
60|$|Then, <b>I</b> considered, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> safe back again, {{this was}} a nice thing to have done! Now I was hot and had made {{the worst of it}} instead of the best.|$|R
25|$|This is Richard's CD. My only {{knowledge}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to {{the studio}} was how {{he seemed to have}} wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E
25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E
25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> {{about half}} way up, I looked behind, and saw one coming after me, swift as the wind; so he overtook me {{just about the}} place where the settle stands.|$|R
5000|$|... Garnered {{so much of}} {{experience}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> reached Calucutta; <b>got</b> several possibilities regarding literary, trade etc." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tommy Dermott," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> {{my nerves}} back somewhat. [...] "Tommy Dermott, I'm {{going to lay}} you across my knee and give you the {{greatest}} thrashing a boy ever got in the world's history." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't want to be there. I thought of other things I wanted to do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't want to be there.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, dear wife, let {{us think}} it over {{for two or three}} days, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> over this little vexation, if I see any reason to change my mind I shall let you know in good time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Joe Bronson {{nodded and}} glanced curiously about him before answering: [...] "Yes; I think the bay life will suit {{me for a}} while, and then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> 've <b>got</b> used to it, I 'm going to sea in the forecastle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come into my room," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{will give}} you some tea. These young people are sure to have it on the terrace. I will join you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> {{rid of some of}} this dust." ...|$|R
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand, and I felt the bone flex. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{to the point where}} I felt like it was going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I just got out of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> my wits, [...] "this {{is neither}} the justice nor the {{moderation}} for which our province is noted. You have elected your committee of your free wills, {{and they have}} claims before you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yassir; of late I done mouty famous. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> to Newbraska, dey folks {{come all}} roun' {{me to see}} dem mule colts. Dey ain't see no mules like dem in Newbraska. I sold dem mules for three hundred dollars. Yassir--three hundred.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{have had}} your {{share of the}} plunder, and you hadn’t a shack to call your own <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> hold of you. Now, when I’m up against an awkward job, you go back on me. However, if I wanted you—” ...|$|R
500|$|... "Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham, Marx and Lopez. [...] "Friends Forever" [...] is {{a parody of}} 1950s-style musical numbers in general, and [...] "We Go Together" [...] from Grease in particular. However, {{this was not the}} original plan. According to Fordham, [...] "I was really shocked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the demo back, because I had never envisioned a '50s number. I did mention 'We Go Together,' just as an example of I wanted a cheesy, fun, happy ending kind of a thing." ...|$|E
500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds.com, Gregson-Williams said that Hood attracted {{him to the}} project, adding: [...] "I happened {{to meet him at}} the Golden Globes dinner about three years ago. That night we were both nominees, but both losers. He had been nominated for Tsotsi and during the dinner I had spoken to him and he seemed like a really smart and creative guy...and into music. So I was really delighted <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a call to meet him and discuss the possibilities for Wolverine." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> a hold upon myself, I {{turned to}} Nan {{white-hot}} with eloquence. Now I was talking not wholly for myself or the pennant, {{but for this}} boy and girl who were at odds in that strangest game of life--love.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{twenty yards}} of strong string, {{and the same}} length of rope that will bear my weight; also a strong screw-driver. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> this <b>I</b> will let you know night and hour. Shall want {{disguise}} ready to put on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, that's enough," [...] said Lestrade. [...] "I am a {{practical}} man, Mr. Holmes, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> my evidence <b>I</b> {{come to my}} conclusions. If {{you have anything to}} say, you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room." ...|$|R
500|$|She [...] {{gave me a}} call, and she was like, [...] "I {{would love}} to do a duet with you. Come by the studio." [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there, she played the song for me. I didn't expect to record the song, but when I heard it, I said, [...] "Man, there's no way I'm going to leave this studio without my voice being on that record." [...] Everything just {{happened}} so fast. I didn't expect for it to be a single or a video. Everything was just great.|$|E
500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I {{think it would be}} a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the end I wrote mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} titled Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?, before its title {{was changed to}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, with [...] "Can you handle our truth?" [...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Richard, is, {{there not}} {{something}} you can do?" [...] she cried, <b>when,</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> her back in the little parlour in Gloucester Street; [...] "father has argued and, pleaded and threatened in vain. I thought,--I thought perhaps you might help him." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “My diet {{was terrible}} at first. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> home, you know, I could only eat {{very little in}} the way of it…it was lack of appetite. It had nothing to do with the food. It was just the lack of appetite.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, I {{shall not}} be always able to explain <b>when</b> and how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them," [...] Fergus laughed. [...] "People {{who do not know}} me will say: ...|$|R
