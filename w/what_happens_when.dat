5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E

25|$|More {{rigorous}} models, {{involving the}} modelling of both electric and magnetic {{fields of the}} light wave, are required when dealing with the detailed interaction of light with materials where the interaction depends on their electric and magnetic properties.

25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability.

They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.|$|E
25|$|When an EUV photon is absorbed, photoelectrons and {{secondary}} electrons are generated by ionization, much like <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> X-rays or electron beams are absorbed by matter. 10 mJ/cm2 EUV photon dose {{results in the}} generation of 109 uC/cm2 dose of photoelectrons.

25|$|Collision {{detection}} typically {{refers to}} the computational problem of detecting the intersection {{of two or more}} objects. While the topic is most often associated with its use in video games and other physical simulations, it also has applications in robotics. In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> a collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics). Solving collision detection problems requires extensive use of concepts from linear algebra and computational geometry.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> {{there is a}} homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) {{where there is a}} limit to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
