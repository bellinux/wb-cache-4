25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke</b> passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
2500|$|The smooth plains {{filling the}} inner part of Rembrandt are {{interpreted}} {{to be of}} the volcanic origin. They are probably similar to the Lunar maria, although they are lighter than the surrounding plains, which is the opposite of what is observed on the Moon. The smooth plains are intersected by a system of wrinkle-ridges and troughs, both having radial or concentric shapes. The concentric ridges form a nearly complete ring with the diameter of about 375km. The radial wrinkle ridges and troughs occur mainly inside this ring. Both radial and concentric ridges have the width between [...] and can be as long as [...] The troughs are generally younger than the ridges, because they cut the latter.

50|$|Design of the Food Balance Wheel {{started with}} a {{modified}} food pyramid at its center. The placement and relative size of each <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke</b> reflects the pyramid’s food groups and serving sizes. The sequencing of the different foods {{was based on the}} USDA Nutritive Value of Foods tables. This arrangement presents the three main nutrient categories (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) as a continuum of different foods transitioning from one to the next, based on the relative proportions of each nutrient. In addition, this layout was adjusted to separate fiber from non-fiber foods, and to place foods containing saturated fat in order from lowest to highest to help steer the user to more healthful food choices.|$|E
50|$|Ferdinand Keller and Frederic Troyon {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} lake shore settlements from the Late Bronze Age (1250-800 BC) in 1858. Friedrich Schwab and Edouard Desor's archeological excavations found many bronze items. One {{of the most striking}} items, a <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke</b> made of bronze and oak wood with a diameter of 51 cm, was discovered in 1862. Other finds included axes, sickles and needles as well as bronze swords and hundreds of vases. There were also a number of crescent-shaped earthenware objects called d'argile croissants. The d'argile croissants are about 30 cm long and may represent constellations. After the first Jura water correction dropped the water levels by 2.7 m, the sites began to erode. In 1925 Paul Vouga took soundings to study the stratigraphy of the site. At his request, the Army made a series of aerial photographs in 1927, which provided a number of fundamental insights into these villages from the Bronze Age.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} public debate {{as to whether}} people {{should be allowed to}} use cell phones while driving. In several countries, this debate has led to restrictions on cell phone use while driving. Japanese data suggests that answering a call might be the most dangerous task, followed by dialing. Several questions were therefore selected for further investigation. 1. How does the dialing device and its location affect task time, errors, driving performance, and ratings of workload? 2. How does the location of the display (especially head-up displays) affect those same measures? 3. For various control-display combinations, how are those measures affected by driving workload? The experiment will be comprised of two distinct portions. In the first portion, subjects will drive a simulator on straight roads (implying controlled workload) while dialing a 10 -digit telephone number using 6 device configurations with various displays. During the second test portion, participants will drive a simulator on roads with curves of different radii while entering phone numbers for 3 different device combinations. The following device/location configurations will be examined: (1) 10 -key keypad on the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke,</b> (2) 10 -key keypad on the center console, (3) joystick on the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>spoke,</b> (4) joystick mounted on the center console, (5) hand held 10 - key keypad, (6) a cross key on the touch screen, and (7) a 10 key keypad on the touch screen. These devices will be used for 3 display conditions: (1) head up display, (2) monitor mounted in the center console, or (3) no display...|$|E

In this project wheels are designed with five spokes and four spokes and comparison has done between the two models using aluminum alloy(LM 25) and Comparing properties of stress and displacement with Magnesium Alloy(AM 60 A) and also the fillet radius is modified. The model is created using pro-e and analysis done in SOLIDWORKS software. Finally by comparison of two materials, aluminum composite material LM 25 with the change in fillet radius has good fatigue life, low stress and high displacement...|$|E
