25|$|The i3 {{allows the}} owner {{to charge the}} battery from a {{conventional}} socket. The BMW i3 has a number of charging functions. AC fast charging can take less than 3 hours {{with the use of the}} BMW i <b>Wallbox</b> Pure or any 3rd party charging equipment (EVSE) supporting 32A, when charging from 0 to 80%. The i3 also has a rapid charging option suitable for public DC charging stations and can take less than 30 minutes to charge from 0% to 80%. In the US, it can also be charged from any public charging station with an SAE J1772 connector. In 2016, BMW and the PG utility in California expanded an experiment of delaying charge-up during peak demand and compensating i3 owners for the delay.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wallboxes</b> were an important, and profitable, {{part of any}} jukebox installation. Serving as {{a remote}} control, they enabled patrons to select tunes from their table or booth. One example is the Seeburg 3W1, {{introduced}} in 1949 as companion to the 100-selection Model M100A jukebox. Stereo sound became popular in the early 1960s, and <b>wallboxes</b> of the era were designed with built-in speakers to provide patrons a sample of this latest technology.|$|R

5000|$|In Antwerp, Arthur Bursens built {{several hundred}} {{relatively}} small roll and book-operated café orchestrions under the trade name [...] "Ideal" [...] and [...] "Arburo" [...] (ARthur BUrsens and(Gustav) ROels). Roels {{was an early}} business partner, succeeded by Frans de Groof. The smaller cafes of the Antwerp area were Bursens' main customers, as these premises often did not have space or income to justify a larger (Mortier or Decap) dance organ. A coin was dropped into a <b>wallbox</b> that allowed one tune from a roll that usually had three or four tunes on it to be played. At the end, the roll would rewind ready to play from the beginning again.Multi-tune rolls were produced frequently {{to keep up with}} the demand to hear the latest popular hits.|$|E
5000|$|In EV mode, the Golf GTE has an all-electric {{range of}} 50 km. The all-electric mode can be {{activated}} at {{the push of}} a button. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is [...] equivalent. The electric power can also be saved - for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around {{three and a half hours}} from a domestic mains outlet, or two and a half hours from a domestic <b>wallbox.</b> The battery weighs 120 kg, giving the GTE a total kerbweight of 1,520 kg.The Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient braking and air conditioning.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the BMW i8 coupe {{prototype}} {{was based on the}} BMW i8 Concept. The BMW i8 prototype has an average fuel efficiency of less than [...] under the New European Driving Cycle with carbon emissions of less than 59 g/km. The i8 with its carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) passenger cell lightweight, aerodynamically optimized body, and BMW eDrive technology offers the dynamic performance of a sports car, with an expected 0 - 100 km sprint time of less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources. The plug-in hybrid system of the BMW i8 comprises a three-cylinder, 1.5-liter BMW TwinPower turbo gasoline engine combined with BMW eDrive technology used in the BMW i3 and develops maximum power of [...] The BMW i8 is the first BMW production model to be powered by a three-cylinder gasoline engine and the resulting specific output of [...] per liter of displacement is on a par with high-performance sports car engines and is the highest of any engine produced by the BMW Group.The BMW i8's second power source is a hybrid synchronous electric motor specially developed and produced by the BMW Group for BMW i. The electric motor develops maximum power of 131 hp (96 kW) and produces its maximum torque of around 320 Nm from standstill. Typical of an electric motor, responsive power is instantly available when starting and this continues into the higher load ranges. As well as providing a power boost to assist the gasoline engine during acceleration, the electric motor can also power the vehicle by itself. Top speed in electric mode is approximately 120 km/h, with a maximum driving range of up to 35 km. Linear acceleration is maintained even at higher speeds since the interplay between the two power sources efficiently absorbs any power flow interruptions when shifting gears. The model-specific version of the high-voltage 7.2 lithium-ion battery has a liquid cooling system and can be recharged at a conventional household power socket, at a BMW i <b>Wallbox</b> or at a public charging station. In the US a full recharge takes approximately 3.5 hours from a conventional 120V, 12 amp household circuit or approximately 1.5 hours from a 220V Level 2 charger.|$|E
