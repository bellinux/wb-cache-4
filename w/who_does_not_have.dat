5|$|After Meredith is {{promoted}} to a resident, her younger half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) begins working at Seattle Grace as an intern. Meredith initially rejects Lexie's attempts {{to form a}} relationship, but slowly softens towards her. The sisters are very different people with different childhoods. Lexie had an idealistic family life and often has difficulty understanding her much darker sister, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the same positive associations with family as Lexie.|$|E

25|$|An {{independent}} voter, {{often called}} an unaffiliated voter in the United States, is a voter {{who does not}} align themselves with a political party. An independent is variously defined as a voter who votes for candidates on issues {{rather than on the}} basis of a political ideology or partisanship; a voter <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> long-standing loyalty to, or identification with, a political party; a voter who does not usually vote for the same political party from election to election; or a voter who self-describes as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Thomas was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Arizona's 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act, a law intended to regulate the presence of illegal immigrants in the state. Sometimes called the “Employer Sanctions Law,” it makes it a felony for a person to take the identity of another person, whether real or fictitious, for the purposes of obtaining employment, and provides civil penalties for employers that intentionally or knowingly employ an alien <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the legal right or authorization under federal law to work in the United States. After the act was signed into law, Thomas set up a web site that explained the law, and provided a form to report violations.|$|E

25|$|Positions {{were first}} advertised at the 19th Australian Jamboree held at Cataract Scout Park in Sydney in January 2001 and by April {{of that same}} year, the first 30 Scouts, Venturers, Rovers and Young Leaders had been chosen to {{represent}} the youth population of Scouts Australia. The council held its first meeting on 4–6 May 2001. Today, there are 25 members on the council from all branches of Scouts Australia. The only non-youth member of the council is the adviser, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any voting rights. The council meets face to face twice a year and works in patrols and meets using online collaborative tools {{throughout the rest of}} the year. The chair of the National Youth Council is a full member of the Scouts Australia National Council and therefore has voting rights on the national operations committee and national executive committee.|$|E
25|$|Access {{to public}} higher {{education}} institutions is subject to enrollment restrictions (numerus clausus), and students must compete for admission. Students who hold a diploma of secondary education (12th grade) or the equivalent, who meet all legal requirements, particularly exams in specific subjects in which minimum marks must be obtained, may apply. Any citizen over 23 years old <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the secondary education diploma (12th grade) can attempt to gain admission to {{a limited number of}} vacant places available, through special examination which includes an interview (Decree law: Decreto-Lei 64/2006, de 21 de Março). Public university's tuition fees are greater than polytechnics', and polytechnic weekend and evening classes are usually organized. For a large number of academic fields, undergraduate and graduate admission criteria and student evaluation in most public university institutions are usually more selective and demanding than in many private institutions or polytechnic institutions. Access to private {{higher education institutions}} is regulated by each institution.|$|E
25|$|Running plays a {{much larger}} role in {{baseball}} because of the low scoring; also, players on the batting team must run much further to score a run, because runners may remain in play (that is, on the bases) without scoring, and because baserunners can advance to the next base before the ball is hit again (steal the base) {{as soon as the}} ball is live. Base stealing often requires sliding, in which the runner throws himself to the ground to avoid being tagged or over-running the base. The runner may also deliberately slide into the fielder at the base he is trying to steal to keep him from catching the ball or to disrupt a double play. At home plate the runner often will simply, and legally, run into a catcher who is blocking the baseline but <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the ball (a defensive player may not impede the runner unless he has the ball or {{is in the process of}} catching it).|$|E

25|$|With {{the drawing}} and weigh-ins completed, wrestlers then compete in two {{brackets}} {{in each of}} the 10 weight classes. If there are not enough wrestlers to fill up the bracket in a weight class, a bye will be awarded to a wrestler <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to compete against another wrestler in his pairing. After taking account the number of byes, the first round in each weight class then begins. Most college wrestling tournaments are in double elimination format. The last two wrestlers in the upper (championship) bracket wrestle for first place in the finals, with the loser winning second place. In other words, a wrestler cannot place higher than third if he is knocked down to the lower (wrestle-back) bracket by losing in the championship semi-finals. This is largely the result of time constraints: one-day tournaments often last into the evening. If the winner of the wrestle-back bracket were allowed to challenge the winner of the championship bracket in the championship, the tournament could continue well past midnight before finishing.|$|E

500|$|Breen stands transfixed and is {{eventually}} {{consumed by the}} energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and {{an image of a}} Martian [...] "devil" [...] floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt, and after Quatermass succumbs to the mass psychosis he attempts to kill Roney, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the alien gene and is therefore immune to the alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, he proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the [...] "devil" [...] but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages to walk up to the apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|Kanako Sasa, usually {{referred}} to by her surname, is a girl who is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class {{at the beginning of}} Wandering Son. She is sometimes called [...] by her younger brother and Chizuru. She makes her first appearance in chapter two of the manga, but is not named until volume two. She is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone's friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. Sasa acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and tries not to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with Yoshino since pre-school, and later becomes close with Chizuru. Sasa is an innocent, childish girl <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school in the morning. She mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.|$|E
