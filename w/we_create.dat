25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>create</b> large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E

25|$|Natural Rights/Justice Argument: this {{argument}} is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind, {{it is possible to}} apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas. Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what <b>we</b> <b>create.</b> Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.|$|E
25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and <b>we</b> <b>create</b> a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E

500|$|In her {{important}} {{study of}} postmodernity and its poetics in literature, Linda Hucheon describes this novel as definitive of a genre she calls [...] "historiographic metafiction".

[...] Typically postmodern, this genre of fiction blends the creation of imagined narratives with critique on the various modes in which <b>we</b> <b>create</b> knowledge, such as history and literature. Important to her discussion of the genre's post-modern style, The French Lieutenant's Womans self-reflexive narration bridges different discourses that usually remain separated, such as academic history, literary criticism, philosophy and literature.|$|E

[...] Svenonius explained that [...] "there's a skeleton that <b>we</b> <b>create</b> and the form of our shows is unchanging - there's an intro, an outro, a middle break. It's very vaudevillian in form". [...] The Make-Up always wore matching uniforms on stage. [...] Like most of the Make-Up's identity, the uniforms were an ideological statement, meant to [...] " [...] individualism.

New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter.

DBC also broadcast soul music, gospel, jazz, funk, r, Afrikan (South African black music) and soca (upbeat calypso). DBC was unique among radio stations in the UK at the time, a black-run station broadcasting black music to a mixed audience.

All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless <b>we</b> <b>create</b> an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have brought us to our knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries...

500|$|Portal: Still Alive was {{announced}} as an exclusive Xbox Live Arcade {{game at the}} 2008 E3 convention, and was released on October 22, 2008.

According to Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi, Microsoft had previously rejected Portal on the platform due to its large size. Portal: Still Alive was well received by reviewers. 1UP.com's Andrew Hayward stated that, with the easier access and lower cost than paying for The Orange Box, Portal is now [...] "stronger than ever".
