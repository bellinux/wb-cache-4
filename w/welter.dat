5|$|<b>Welter</b> {{was born}} in Cologne-Lindenthal (Köln-Lindenthal) on 25 February 1916. He joined the {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe in 1934 and was trained as a pilot. He showed a strong natural ability as a pilot and was subsequently selected for flight instructor training and served many years as a flight instructor. In 1943 <b>Welter</b> transferred to an operational night fighter unit flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. On 18 October 1944, after 40 combat missions, <b>Welter</b> was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In early 1945, <b>Welter</b> transferred to an experimental jet night fighter unit flying the Messerschmitt Me 262. On 11 March 1945 {{he was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves for 48 aerial victories. <b>Welter</b> survived the war and was killed in an accident at a railroad crossing on 7 March 1949.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Welter's claims for success in nocturnal aerial combat with the Me 262 stems from a memorandum written by <b>Welter</b> on 29 May 1945 for his British captors. In this memorandum <b>Welter</b> stated that between December 1944 {{and the end of}} January 1945, as the sole pilot of Kommando <b>Welter,</b> he flew seven Me 262 sorties and achieved three victories against Mosquito aircraft and two victories against Lancaster aircraft. <b>Welter</b> further stated that from the formation of 10./NJG11 on 28 January 1945 {{to the end of the}} war, 10./NJG11 flew around another 63 operational sorties and claimed a further 38 victories against Mosquito aircraft at night and five victories against Mosquito aircraft by day; his share being 20 Mosquitos at night and two during the day. Thus, according to the memo, a total of 25 Mosquitoes and two Lancasters were claimed in aerial combat by <b>Welter,</b> flying the Me 262 with the Kommando/Staffel, while other pilots of the Staffel claimed a further 21 kills (of which three were achieved with the two-seater Me 262). Official Luftwaffe documents show that by 4 April 1945, 10./NJG11 had claimed 34 aerial victories, of which only one was claimed in a two-seater Me262. Research of RAF records show that at most 15 Mosquitoes could have been possibly destroyed by Kommando Welter—10./NJG11.|$|E
5|$|<b>Welter</b> {{was born}} on 25 February 1916 in Cologne-Lindenthal. Following {{schooling}} and completing a merchant apprenticeship, he joined the Luftwaffe on 1 October 1934 and was trained as a pilot. Because of his skill as a pilot he was trained as a flight instructor. During World War II, <b>Welter</b> was promoted to Feldwebel on 1 August 1940 and transferred to flight training school Flieger-Ausbildungs-Regiment 63 and later on to the flight instructor school at Quedlinburg. Here <b>Welter</b> served as a flight instructor until 10 August 1943 when he was transferred to Blindflugschule 10 (school for instrument flight training) in Altenburg with the rank of Oberfeldwebel as a night fighter instructor.|$|E

5|$|In July, <b>Welter</b> claimed two United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress four-engined {{bombers and}} three North American P-51 Mustangs, {{two of which}} claimed on 19 July between Munich and Memmingen, shot down by day. From 25 July 1944, <b>Welter</b> served with 1. Staffel/Nachtjagdgruppe 10 (NJGr10) {{performing}} further Wilde Sau missions. He claimed four Royal Air Force (RAF) Avro Lancaster four-engine heavy bombers shot down {{on the night of}} 29 August 1944 to record his 24th through 27th victories.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 1944, <b>Welter</b> was {{transferred}} to II. Gruppe/Nachtjagdgeschwader 11 (NJG11), a reformation of his former unit. Here he was given command of a special Kommando subordinate to II./NJG11, set up on 11 November 1944 at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin's southern Lärz airbase (2 November 1944 – 28 January 1945), and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter of RAF Mosquitos attacking the Berlin area. According to some sources, Oberleutnant <b>Welter</b> added a Lancaster to his growing list of Mosquitos {{on the night of}} 12 December 1944, the first night victory by a jet fighter. Other sources state that his first aerial victory flying the Me 262 was claimed either on the night of 2 January 1945 or 5 January 1945. On 28 January 1945, the unit initially known as Sonderkommando Stamp, named after its founder Major Gerhard Stamp and then Sonderkommando <b>Welter,</b> was re-designated 10. Staffel/NJG11 and transferred to the airfield at Burg near Magdeburg (28 January 1945 – 12 April 1945). The unit was equipped with Me 262 jet fighters, and tasked with intercepting Mosquito bomber aircraft of No. 8 Group RAF in the Berlin area. The Me 262 were not fitted with radar and used the aid of ground control and the searchlight defences, partially a Wilde Sau form of night combat. <b>Welter</b> had claimed three aerial victories while flying the Me 262 by early February 1945.|$|E

25|$|Christian {{had three}} younger siblings, a sister, actress Ariadna Gloria <b>Welter</b> (1930–1998), and two brothers, Gerardus Jacob <b>Welter</b> (born 1924) and Edward Albert <b>Welter</b> (born 1932).|$|E
25|$|Christian {{was born}} as Blanca Rosa <b>Welter</b> in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, a {{daughter}} of Dutch engineer and Royal Dutch Shell executive, Gerardus Jacob <b>Welter</b> (1904–1981), and his Mexican-born wife, the former Blanca Rosa Vorhauer (1901-1992), who was of Spanish, German and French descent. The <b>Welter</b> family moved a great deal during Christian's youth, living everywhere from South America and Europe to the Middle East and Africa. As {{a result of this}} nomadic lifestyle, Christian became an accomplished polyglot with the ability to speak fluent French, German, Dutch, Spanish, English, Italian and even a bit of haphazard Arabic and Russian.|$|E
25|$|The Me 262's top ace was {{probably}} Hauptmann Franz Schall with 17 kills, including six four-engine bombers and 10 P-51 Mustang fighters, although night fighter ace Oberleutnant Kurt <b>Welter</b> claimed 25 Mosquitos and two four-engine bombers {{shot down by}} night and two further Mosquitos by day. Most of Welter's claimed night kills were achieved by eye, even though <b>Welter</b> had tested a prototype Me 262 fitted with FuG 218 Neptun radar. Another candidate for top ace on the aircraft was Oberstleutnant Heinrich Bär, who claimed 16 enemy aircraft.|$|E

Another bout included former world champion Cameron <b>Welter.</b> On March 26, 1933, Ross had his first world title bout when he faced world lightweight and light welterweight champion and fellow three-division world champion Tony Canzoneri in Chicago. In one night, Ross became a two-division world champion when he beat Canzoneri by decision in ten rounds. Ross also campaigned heavily {{in the city of}} Chicago prior to the fight. After two more wins, including a knockout in six rounds over Johnny Farr, Ross and Canzoneri boxed again, with Ross winning again by decision, but this time in 15.|$|E

25|$|In June 1985, tragedy strikes for the Osmans when Sue awakes to {{discover}} baby Hassan laying motionless in his cot. Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, {{so it is}} concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes into shock. She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in a <b>welter</b> of depression. Sue eventually manages {{to come to terms}} with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{spent three}} days resting his troops at Reims while Marshal Michel Ney reoccupied Châlons-sur-Marne. Ney was joined by a 3,000-man {{division}} that Jan Willem Janssens brought in from the Ardennes garrisons. The French emperor desired to move east to gather up other garrisons, but Schwarzenberg's offensive to the south compelled him to march in that direction. While Napoleon operated against Blücher in the north, the main Allied army pressed MacDonald back toward Paris. On 27 February, Schwarzenberg defeated Oudinot in the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube, forcing MacDonald to withdraw to the west. The Allies overpowered MacDonald on 3–4 March at the Battle of Laubressel. Schwarzenberg occupied Troyes but halted there until 12 March in a <b>welter</b> of indecision. Encouraged by news of Blucher's victory at Laon, the main Allied army crossed the Seine River and drove MacDonald beyond Provins by 16 March. Schwarzenberg's offensive came to a sudden halt when tidings of Napoleon's success at Reims arrived in the Allied camp.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Jesus Fellowship {{had joined}} the Evangelical Alliance, one of whose {{membership}} requirements was that the church remain in close fellowship with other local evangelical churches. Earlier in 1986, the Evangelical Alliance had launched an inquiry into the beliefs and practices of the Jesus Fellowship Church {{and found that it}} no longer qualified for membership, citing much the same problems as did the Baptist Union later that year. But at least as relevant in both cases {{was the fact that the}} rise of the JA came at a time when an international <b>welter</b> of anti-cult activity was under way. Allegations that the JA had too authoritarian a style of leadership and that members were under pressure to commit to lifelong celibacy, together with the fact that corporal punishment of children (rodding) was practised, and that community members were required to hand over their material possessions, left them vulnerable to accusations of cultic practices. Their intense style and all-engulfing requirement of commitment led to some allegations of abuse from disillusioned former members, and some hostility from more conventional churchgoers. A number of churches within the Evangelical Alliance threatened to leave if the Jesus Fellowship Church was allowed to remain a member.|$|E
