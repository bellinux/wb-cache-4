25|$|We've {{already got}} lists of song ideas. We never stop writing. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio {{with all the}} best laid plans then what {{we end up with}} is not what we intended. It's just {{exciting}} to wonder what will come out the speakers in a year's time. We have very exciting things lined up. It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues.|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of doing a story about Valkyrie. As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dining-room, and she {{switched}} on the lights.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little morning-room, and Poirot {{closed the}} door.|$|R
60|$|Then before I {{had time}} to answer Savage came up and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Delighted, I'm sure!" [...] {{the latter}} answered, utterly unsuspicious. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> smoking-room now, {{or would you}} rather play a rubber first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the whole}} thing is {{tingling}} in my brain," [...] he protested. [...] "Couldn't <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> library? We could find a corner by ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you and she {{understand}} each other," [...] said the squire, [...] "that will be sufficient. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room now, or out upon the lawn?" ...|$|E
60|$|To this Franklin agreed, {{and forth}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Square, rejoicing in our freedom from those accursed bags.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> large {{garden at}} the back of the house, and there I {{committed}} another act of duplicity.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> palace, {{and even}} in this hour of fear, after me came the minstrels as before.|$|R
6000|$|WELLWYN. Oh! Ah! Yes. [Going {{towards the}} two reformers.] Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house, Professor, and settle the {{question}} quietly while the Vicar sees a young man? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the 'Bell,' sir, {{where we}} {{generally}} put up," [...] remarked Reynolds, at my elbow. [...] "You {{will have some}} lunch, sir, before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, dad," [...] he said, [...] "suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{other room}} and talk this thing {{over for a}} few minutes. Miss Thurwell will not mind excusing us." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{restaurant}} and ordered lunch. In {{about half an}} hour a small boy came hastily in and addressed Sinclair.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> library, {{disturbing}} a quiet, good sort of bibliopole there, who, {{with some}} regret, put aside his book to guide us.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parlour and sat down. There {{was an old}} fellow there, {{smoking a}} long clay pipe, and we {{naturally}} began chatting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{moments when}} I think I'd {{like to be}} removed," [...] said Curtis, as he turned towards Mr. Slicer and his other guests. [...] "Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> library, gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we have to}} get out, {{what are}} we to do?" [...] {{questioned}} Randy, soberly. [...] "I don't believe we can get work, unless <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods as mere choppers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "S’pose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden a bit?" [...] {{suggested}} Barber, uneasily. The two ladies had eyed {{each other}} for three minutes without blinking, and his own eyes were watering in sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Follow us and be silent,' I {{said to them}} as they gazed with {{wondering}} eyes, clinging one to another. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first ante-room.|$|R
60|$|So down <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cabin, and to {{my great}} joy Queequeg was soon {{enrolled}} among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{little room}} and awoke Oliver, who sprang up {{in a great}} fright, {{thinking}} that something untoward had happened at the mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hellish noise!" [...] said Stalky, critically. [...] "'Don't think Colonel Dabney {{will like}} it. I move <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Lodge and get {{something}} to eat. We might as well see the fun out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In the Channel, I guess. There {{was nothing}} in the papers about 'em. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drawin'-room, and see what these boys and girls are doin?' But say, ain't life in England interestin'? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{suggested}} Batley, [...] "suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> smoking {{end of the}} car. I {{dare say}} you'd like a talk and it's rather noisy here. Besides, the cinders are a little too plentiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parlor, and as {{we joined}} the dancers, despite all that {{confusion}} I heard her whisper: [...] "I've been a little beast to you." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} poor. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third-class {{restaurant}} at the station. He ordered beer and bread and sausage; I ordered soup and boiled beef and vegetables.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Zimmer will be clever {{enough to}} drift his outfit along {{one or two}} at a time?' I asked Morton, and he {{reassured}} me. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> saloon.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{stick to}} me, Mr Gresham," [...] he said, [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dining-room. I'm an old {{hand at the}} duke's dinners, {{and know how to}} make a friend {{comfortable}} as well as myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{are we to}} do, Ned?" [...] Gerald said. [...] "If we stay here, {{we shall}} be starved. If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town, we shall have our throats cut. Which think you is the best?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not late. The thunder-cloud {{has made}} it seem dark--see there; a line of pale yellow {{stretches}} along the horizon from west to north. That's evening--not gone yet. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fresh air for a minute?' ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hut {{taking the}} stools with us, and seated {{ourselves}} {{by the fire}} that burned there on to which Umslopogaas threw chips of resinous wood.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{particulars}} of that difficulty. [...] "They wouldn't catch me, because I'd sink first. Give me a yacht," [...] said Gordon-Nasmyth; [...] "that's all I need." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Chief's office. There were maps of {{mountains}} on the walls; also {{one or two}} lithographs of celebrated guides, and {{a portrait of the}} scientist De Saussure.|$|R
