5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances. In magic, fire <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than wind, wind <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than thunder, and thunder <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes and bows, axes and bows <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|R

5|$|In the 18thcentury, there <b>was</b> <b>strong</b> {{interest}} in discovering a Northwest Passage {{that would permit}} navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta, who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On {{the advice of his}} officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current <b>was</b> <b>strong.</b> He considered it a bay, and called it Ensenada de Asunción. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled Rio de San Roque, or an entrance, called Entrada de Hezeta. Following Heceta's reports, British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist. He named Cape Disappointment for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.|$|E
