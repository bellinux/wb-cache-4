5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe <b>whip</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are 24 {{species of}} reptiles, 11 {{of which have}} a {{population}} of global significance. They include red <b>whip</b> <b>snake,</b> Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European pond turtle, Balkan pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy.|$|E

Grugidj sub-totems included pelican, parrot, mopoke and large kangaroo. Gamadj sub-totems included emu, <b>whip</b> <b>snake,</b> possum, koala, and sparrowhawk. Clans intermarried with the Dja Dja Wurrung, Jardwadjali, Dhauwurd wurrung and Wada wurrung peoples.|$|E

40|$|I staged {{replicate}} encounters between unrestrained lizards {{and snakes}} in outdoor enclosures to examine size-dependent pre-dation within the common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti). Yellow-faced <b>whip</b> <b>snakes</b> (Demansia psammophis) forage widely for active prey and most often consumed large skinks, whereas death adders (Acanthophis antarcticus) ambush active prey and most often consumed small skinks. Small-eyed snakes (Rhinoplocephalus nigrescens) forage widely for inactive prey and consumed both {{small and large}} skinks equally often. Differential predation may reflect active choice by the predator, differential prey vulnerability, or both. To test for active choice, I presented foraging snakes with an inert small lizard versus an inert large lizard. They did not actively select lizards of a particular body size. To test for differential prey vulnerability, I quantified variation between small and large lizards in behavior that is important for determining the outcome of predator–prey interactions. Snakes did not differentiate between integumentary chemicals from small and large lizards. Large lizards tend to flee from approaching predators, thereby eliciting attack by the visually oriented <b>whip</b> <b>snakes.</b> Small lizards were more mobile than large lizards and therefore more likely to pass by sedentary death adders. Additionally, small skinks were more effectively lured by this sit-and-wait species {{and less likely to}} avoid its first capture attempt. In contrast, overnight retreat site selection (not body size) deter-mined a lizard’s chances of being detected by small-eyed snakes. Patterns of size-dependent predation by elapid snakes ma...|$|R

50|$|Ahaetulla is a genus of {{colubrid}} snakes {{commonly referred to}} as vine <b>snakes,</b> or <b>whip</b> <b>snakes.</b> They are considered by some scientists to be mildly venomous and are what is commonly termed as 'rear-fanged' or more appropriately, opisthoglyphous, meaning their enlarged teeth or fangs, intended to aid in venom delivery, are located {{in the back of the}} upper jaw, instead of in the front as they are in vipers or cobras. As colubrids, Ahaetulla do not possess a true venom gland or a sophisticated venom delivery system. The Duvernoy's gland of this genus, homologous to the venom gland of true venomous snakes, produces a secretion which, though not well studied, is considered not to be medically significant to humans.|$|R
40|$|In snakes, {{body size}} and {{reproductive}} output vary greatly among disjunct populations. Clutch size is notably influenced by food availability, thermal conditions and maternal body size. A comparison between three large-scale areas – north continental, south continental and island populations of European <b>whip</b> <b>snakes</b> – revealed significant variation in body size and reproductive output. More importantly, {{there was a}} geographical difference in the covariation between clutch size and maternal body size, two traits mechanistically linked as body size constrains clutch size. This suggests that clutch size can vary independently of maternal body size, a situation that provides opportunities to tease apart the contribution of phenotypic plasticity from local genetic adaptations in these two life-history traits...|$|R
