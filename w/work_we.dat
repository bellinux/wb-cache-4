The Songs of Ascent project ultimately did not come to fruition and has not been released; its evolution and apparent abandonment are examined in the book The Greatest Albums You'll Never Hear. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "We thought there was more material left over from No Line... we now feel a long way from that material." [...] The dance-centric album was ultimately aborted as well; Clayton said, [...] "The <b>work</b> <b>we</b> did with RedOne was very, very exciting. But again, I'm not sure it was the essence of what U2 is good at... we have to do what we do best and we have to focus on that, and the <b>work</b> <b>we</b> did with Danger Mouse came closest to that."
