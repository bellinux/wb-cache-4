40|$|The {{deposition}} of wood resins (i. e. <b>wood</b> <b>pitch,</b> or pitch) {{has been a}} problem for the pulp and paper industry for many years. Unfortunately <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> fixatives do not eliminate wood resin deposition all of the time. <b>Wood</b> <b>pitch</b> deposition is a potential bottleneck in the reduction of water used to make paper. In order to address these problems a study into the nature of the interactions which occur between cationic polymeric fixatives, wood resins and wood fibres has been undertaken. During the course of these investigations a novel pitch fixative has been designed: guar gumgraft-poly(acrylamide-co-diallyldimethYlammonium chloride). The nature of interactions was explored through a number of techniques. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to quantify the interaction between cationic polymeric fixatives and wood resins; for the first time. Laser particle size analysis (LPSA) was used to determine the effect of cationic polymeric fixatives addition on colloidal particle stability. Deposition studies were used to test interaction theories between cationic polymeric fixatives, wood resins and wood fibres. It was found that <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> fixatives worked in one of two ways; by either disrupting colloidal extractive stability, or by maintaining colloidal extractive stability. The novel fixative GG-g-p(AM-co-DADMAC) is unique in that it takes advantage of the colloidal stabilising features of a natural product (i. e. guar gum) and the <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> fixative properties of a synthetic polymer (i. e. p(AM-co-DADMAC)) ...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{contains}} {{only a very}} small amount of lipophilic extractives, commonly known as <b>wood</b> <b>pitch.</b> The pitch is known to cause severe problems in papermaking processes. The amount of pitch in process waters can be decreased by seasoning of the raw material prior to pulping, pulp washing, removal of pitch by flotation, adsorption of pitch onto various mineral surfaces, and retention of pitch to the fibre material by cationic polymers. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of pH on some of the methods used for pitch control. Experiments were performed using laboratory-made <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> emulsions with varying pH, salt concentration, hemicellulose concentration and pitch composition. These emulsions were used to study the phase distribution of resin and fatty acids, the colloidal stability of pitch with and without steric stabilisation by galactoglucomannans, and the interactions between <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> and mineral particles. Purification of unbleached and peroxidebleached mill process water was performed by froth flotation in combination with a foaming agent. The distribution of resin and fatty acids (RFAs) between colloidal pitch droplets and the water phase was very dependent on pH. At pH 3, almost all of the RFAs were attached to the pitch droplets, while increasing the pH led to increasing concentration of dissolved RFAs in the water phase. The presence of salt shifted the release of RFAs towards higher pH, while lower ratio of neutral pitch in the emulsion resulted in release of RFAs at lower pH. It was also seen that the dissolution and adsorption of RFAs at sudden pHchanges takes place very quickly. Colloidal pitch was more stable against electrolyte-induced aggregation at higher pH, due to its higher anionic charge. The concentration of cationic polymers needed to aggregate colloidal pitch also increased with increasing pH. The surface characteristics of solid particles, such as amount of charged groups, were very important for understanding their interactions with colloidal <b>wood</b> <b>pitch.</b> Water-soluble galactoglucomannans stabilised the colloidal pitch sterically against aggregation, but could not completely prevent interactions between <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> and hydrophilic particles. Froth flotation of unbleached and peroxidebleached process water showed that the pitch could be removed more effectively and selectively at low pH, compared to at neutral pH. The pitch was removed more effectively, using lower concentrations of foaming agent, from peroxide-bleached water than from unbleached water. The results show that pH has a major impact on various pulping and papermaking processes. It determines the anionic charge of the colloidal pitch and the solubility of certain pitch components. Because of this, the pH influences the effectiveness of pitch retention and removal of pitch. The results indicate that pitch problems could be diminished by acknowledging the importance of pH in various papermaking processes...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the effects that wood {{extractive}} composition has on pitch deposition was conducted using model solutions comprised of a resin acid, fatty acid and triglyceride. The deposition behaviour was investigated under various conditions of pH and temperature. Statistical pitch deposition models were developed {{through the use of}} general multiple linear regression analysis techniques to relate total pitch deposited to the interaction of the various components present in the pitch before deposition. These statistical models were used to predict suitable control strategies for various pH and temperature conditions. Three of the classes of chemical compounds found in wet end and wood extractive chemistry were investigated in this study. The results and deposition models developed help to explain why strategies to control <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> deposition have and/or have not worked.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>pitch</b> {{deposition}} has antagonised the papermaker {{for over}} two hundred years. Fixatives, chemistries which are used to attach wood resin to wood fibre, {{have been used to}} alleviate <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> deposition to varying degrees of success. This paper aims to present a new method by which fixatives can be evaluated at a molecular level {{in a short period of}} time. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) is used in many industries, including pulp and paper, as an analytical technique for the separation of analytes under the application of an electric field whereby the differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of the analytes lead to their separation. This paper makes use of CE, not for its separation of analytes but for quantification of interactions between analytes and selectivity modifiers. Electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) is a variation of CE where a selectivity modifier is included in the electrolyte. In using wood resin fixatives as selectivity modifiers and wood resin components as analytes, we were able to determine their interactions at a variety of pHs and temperatures. The result of this development is the ability to recommend a given fixative chemistry for the unique pH, temperature and extractive composition of a given pulp and/or paper mill. Details of the methods, results and data interpretation are included in this paper...|$|E

Sparking caused a decrease in the tack of the deposits in one case. Lower bleach use occurred in two other mills; sparking reduced the degree of ink reattachment to fiber. The payback for either application is attractive. Sparking induced deposition of contaminants in another mill, which is a positive development- if it can be controlled.

40|$|In {{the first}} three centuries AD an {{explosion}} in the long distance trade between the Roman Empire and various states in India, East Africa and South Arabia, known as the Erythraean Sea Trade, was sparked by Roman Imperial interests and the expensive tastes of Rome’s growing elite. In the north of the Red Sea, this created bustling, cosmopolitan port communities at Aila, Berenike and Myos Hormos. The peoples of both Egypt and Nabataea could only await the implications for their lives in being subject to empire and the economic opportunities available through providing for its elite. More specifically, these annexed kingdoms had indigenous populations who inhabited the desert coastal regions of the Red Sea, which were perceived in antiquity as being ethnically distinct and whose various relationships with the Roman Imperial authorities were varied, often chequered. Here they are discussed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover the role of maritime activities in the construction of group identities in the Northern Red Sea ports of {{the first three}} centuries AD. This question has five component parts: How is group identity (such as ethnicity) defined? How is identity represented archaeologically? How to identify maritime activities? How important were maritime activities in defining group identities? And: How can we recognise the various power relationships that shaped these identities? This study provides detailed analysis of original material from Aila, Berenike and Myos Hormos, namely maritime artefacts that cover many finds groups (metal, cordage, basketry, bone, shell, horn, <b>wood,</b> <b>pitch,</b> stone) as well as reanalysis of published or forthcoming material from the finds groups of ceramics, stoppers, and faunal remains from these sites. These artefacts provide an independent source of information with which to compare historical documents on these communities.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 White pitch {{deposits}} {{originated from}} the wood extractives, synthetic polymers, and additives {{used in the}} papermaking process, etc. may cause numerous problems to the papermaking process and also degrade the product quality. The timely analysis and characterization of white pitch deposit is important for tracing {{the origin of the}} deposits. Despite the severity of problem of white pitch deposits, there is little information on analysis of these contaminants. Gas chromatography (GC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-NMR), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to separate the complex constituents and identify the functional groups of the white pitch deposits. GC analysis based on retention time allowed to determine paraffin wax, polyethylene wax, <b>wood</b> <b>pitch</b> residues, and certain additives such as rosin. Hot-melt adhesives and cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene were separated by SEC based on molecular weight and verified by FTIR and ¹H-NMR. By using instrumental analysis technique can analyze the complex white pitch deposits and trace the origin of those. Grafting of synthetic polymers onto cellulose and its derivatives is a useful way to improve their qualities and to expand the range of their uses. To date there are a few useful reaction schemes to prepare for the new classes of materials with the advantages of both material. Most of the proposed grafting reactions are carried out by free radical mechanisms. But these procedures have some inherent disadvantages. So in this study acylation reaction mechanism was adopted to achieve a high level of control compared to free radical reactions over the grafting reaction. Ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer (EMA) and styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA) were grafted onto cellulose acetate (CA) and methyl cellulose (MC) in a simple and effective way under homogeneous reaction conditions.
