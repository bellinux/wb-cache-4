5|$|There is no {{documentation}} of what inspired Nielsen {{to write his}} Fifth Symphony or <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write it, but it is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the winter and spring of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on Funen, and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg.|$|E

As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{had shown that}} he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.|$|E
5|$|Sarmiento was an educator, {{a civilized}} {{man who was}} a militant {{adherent}} to the Unitarist movement. During the Argentine civil war he fought against Facundo several times, and while in Spain he {{became a member of}} the Literary Society of Professors. Exiled to Chile by Rosas <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write Facundo, Sarmiento would later return as a politician. He was a member of the Senate after Rosas's fall and president of Argentina for six years (18681874). During his presidency, Sarmiento concentrated on migration, sciences, and culture. His ideas were based on European civilization; for him, the development of a country was rooted in education. To this end, he founded Argentina's military and naval colleges.|$|E

5|$|After {{this the}} {{historical}} record of Calakmul becomes very vague, due both to the poor state of the heavily eroded monuments at the city itself and also its reduced political presence on the wider Maya stage. Wamaw K'awiil is named at Quiriguá on the southern periphery of Mesoamerica. Quiriguá traditionally had been a vassal of its southern neighbour Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. By 734 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown {{that he was no}} longer an obedient subordinate of Copán <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. This local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger political struggle between Tikal and Calakmul. In 736, only two years later, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K'awiil of Calakmul, while Copán was one of Tikal's oldest allies. The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant, falling between the accession of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quiriguá as a vassal of Copán and the outright rebellion that was to follow. This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quiriguá's rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley. It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne. In 738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured the powerful but elderly king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron deities. The captured lord was taken back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual.|$|E

25|$|Balasubramanian {{started his}} {{research}} activities in 1965 {{focusing on the}} structure and functions of proteins and polypeptides and worked on the thermodynamic analysis of their stability. The focus of his research changed in 1984/85 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> work on ocular science and concentrated on crystallins of eye lens and their function as an agent in keeping the lens transparent. His research revealed how cataract is caused when crystallins are damaged photochemically, thereby leading to diminished lenticular transparency. He argued that the oxidative stress on the lens induces covalent chemical changes in the constituent molecules and these changes lead to cataract. He researched further on the subject to find out that, by supplementing antioxidants and cytoprotective substances, the progression of cataract can be slowed down. These findings {{are known to have}} introduced a prophylactic approach to addressing the issue of cataract, which is reported to be the causal factor for 47.9 percent of the blindness in the world. Further, he attempted to identify the cataractostatic agents and proposed the benefits of tea polyphenols, Ginko Biloba and Withania somnifera extracts. These substances contained antioxidants and cytoprotective compounds which slow down the progression of oxidative cataract and this was verified during experiments in animals.|$|E

[...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843.
