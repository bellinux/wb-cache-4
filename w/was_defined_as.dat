5|$|From 1889 to 1960, {{the meter}} <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> {{the length of}} a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the International Prototype Meter bar.

5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E

5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer.

5|$|During 1988, {{when the}} Lithuanian {{movement}} towards independence was gaining strength, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet again recognized the tricolor {{as the national}} flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Lithuanian SSR. The flag <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of Soviet flags). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.|$|E

5|$|Planning {{for what}} would become SR 125 north of I-8 began in 1954. Route 282 <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a route from Brown Field through La Mesa {{extending}} to Route 277 in 1959, and in 1961 the latter terminus was changed to Route 278. The California Highway Commission selected a route for the highway in mid-1963. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 125 was designated as the highway from SR 75 near Brown Field to SR 56. Route198 was renumbered as State Route67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic era, {{there was}} a move {{among some of the}} German states to reform their systems of {{measurement}} using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units. Baden, in 1810, for example, redefined the Ruthe (rods) as being 3.0m exactly and defined the subunits of the Ruthe as 1 Ruthe = 10Fuß (feet) = 100Zoll (inches) = 1,000Linie (lines) = 10,000Punkt (points) while the Pfund <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> being 500g, divided into 30Loth, each of 16.67g. Bavaria, in its reform of 1811, trimmed the Bavarian Pfund from 561.288g to 560g exactly, consisting of 32 Loth, each of 17.5g while the Prussian Pfund remained at 467.711g.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a step 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5.

The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours on-duty and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers).

5|$|Scientists have {{commonly}} understood Tyrannosauroidea {{to include}} the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors.
