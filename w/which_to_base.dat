5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
50|$|Deep magic {{refers to}} {{techniques}} {{that are not}} widely known, and may be deliberately kept secret. The number of such techniques has arguably decreased in recent years, especially {{in the field of}} cryptography, many aspects of which are now open to public scrutiny.

It also defines heavy wizardry, <b>which</b> refers <b>to</b> code <b>based</b> on obscure or undocumented intricacies of particular hardware or software.|$|R

5|$|Because medieval Scotland {{lacked the}} {{intrusive}} government and growing bureaucracy {{that can be}} found in contemporaneous England, there is very little evidence on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> reliable estimates of population before the early 18th century. On the basis that it had roughly a sixth of the farmable land of England, {{it has been suggested that}} the population would have been of a similar proportion, probably a little less than a million at its height before the Black Death reached the country in 1349. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the 15th century. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of fifty burghs that existed at the beginning of the period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 by the end of the era.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{evaluations}} {{have been}} based on various operational or financial measures of performance, but no one factor provides a clear indication of productive or ineffective performance.

25|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} {{is superior to}} use in decision making {{when there is a}} high level of uncertainty or limited information in <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people who are less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1981, Pacheco {{took a job}} as a {{volunteer}} inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, so that he and Newkirk would have some firsthand knowledge on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> their campaigns. Edward Taub, a psychologist, was working there on 17 monkeys. He had cut sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to their arms and legs, then used physical restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food to force them to use the limbs. The idea was to see whether monkeys could be induced to use limbs they could not feel.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including agency fee clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban agency fee agreements, there was no governmental action on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge agency fee payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators Jesse Helms, Dan Quayle, Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1848 sale the {{maintenance}} of the house and gardens was neglected. Though the school tried its best it was obvious by the 1980s that a major restoration was needed. On taking over ownership of the gardens the National Trust commissioned a survey on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> a restoration strategy. Individual trees, boundaries, buildings, lakes, paths and fences were mapped. The first principle was to keep all buildings and planted features that were in existence by the time the last plan of the garden in 1843 was created. Another was to restore the main views and axes of the garden. The process was greatly helped by the Stowe Papers, some 350,000 documents that are now {{in the collection of the}} Huntington Library, containing extensive and detailed information on the creation of both the house and gardens.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, {{the results of}} his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>base</b> his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.|$|E
