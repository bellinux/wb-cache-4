On their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the final two band members, the brothers find the road through Jackson Park blocked by an American Nazi Party demonstration on a bridge; Elwood runs them off the bridge into the East Lagoon. The last two band members, who now run a soul food restaurant, rejoin the band {{against the advice of}} one's wife. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in Calumet City, and Ray, as usual, takes an IOU.|$|E
5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each room had one door and one window. When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed care plans did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed care plans. Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
