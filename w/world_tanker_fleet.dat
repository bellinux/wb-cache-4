25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for the oil companies however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the <b>world</b> <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of the oil companies was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E

50|$|Liberia {{maintains}} an open maritime registry, meaning that owners of ships can register their vessels as Liberian with relatively few restrictions. This {{has meant that}} Liberian ship registration is usually understood as the employment of a flag of convenience. Liberia has the second-largest maritime registry in the world behind Panama, with 3,500 vessels registered under its flag accounting for 11% of ships worldwide. This includes 35% of the <b>world's</b> <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> Liberia earned more than $18 million from its maritime program in 2000.|$|R

50|$|International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (INTERTANKO) is the {{association}} of {{the owner of the}} independent <b>tankers</b> in the <b>world.</b> It started in 1970 to speak out for the independent tankers' owners, non-oil companies and non-state controlled tanker owners, for the safe shipping of oil and chemicals and to act as a forum for marine policy creation.Membership is open to independent tanker owners and operators of oil and chemical tankers, i.e. non-oil companies and non-state controlled tanker owners, who fulfil the Association's membership criteria. Independent owners operate some 80% of the <b>world's</b> <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> and the vast majority are INTERTANKO members. As of January 2012, the organisation had 235 members, whose combined fleet comprises some 3,380 tankers totalling 285 million dwt. INTERTANKO's associate membership stands at some 320 companies with an interest in shipping of oil and chemicals.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} some {{insights}} as to how oil prices and oil flows might vary with the carrying capacity of the <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> as affected by political events. It provides an econometric analysis of tanker freight rates {{in the modern era}} and proposes a mathematical (quadratic) programming economic model that links the crude oil market to the supply elasticity of the <b>world</b> oil <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> based on a competitive economy. The economic model can be considered as a version of the Walras-Cassel general-equilibrium system which possesses an economically meaningful equilibrium solution in terms of oil prices, freight rates and the pattern of oil distribution. The implementation of the model is completed using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The study concludes with a scenario study showing how the model could be used to examine the importance of South East Asia's sealanes in world seaborne oil trade. The model shows the economic vulnerability of oil importing nations, especially Japan, the United States, and Western Europe, to a possible closure of South East Asian sealanes.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an historical {{perspective of the}} global oil-tanker market, the international <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet,</b> and the major trends in tanker ownership. The available data indicate that outside the OECD, {{more than half of}} large tanker capacity is ultimately owned by governments compared to less than one percent within the OECD. A positive correlation is identified between oil imports and tanker ownership at the national level, but only for non-OECD countries. This result suggests that the forecasted increases in oil imports and exports by emerging economies {{over the next two decades}} are likely to result in higher levels of government ownership of the international oil <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet.</b> petroleum, oil <b>tanker,</b> maritime law, OECD...|$|R
50|$|Long-range {{operations}} were entirely {{dependent upon the}} RAF's <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet</b> and so fourteen Handley Page Victor tankers were transferred from RAF Marham to Ascension Island. The RAF tankers themselves were capable of being refuelled in flight, which meant {{that it was possible}} to set up relays of aircraft. At RAF Marham, the tanker force was set to planning refuelling operations to take one or more bombers to the Falklands and back. Initial long range operations by the RAF involved the use of Victor aircraft for photo reconnaissance of the region surrounding South Georgia; these missions demonstrated the capability of the Victor <b>tanker</b> <b>fleet,</b> flying out of Ascension, to support intelligence gathering and aggressive operations in the South Atlantic.|$|R
