500|$|Van Gogh {{claimed the}} {{painting}} as [...] "something funny... I will not create every day." [...] There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> setting for this painting that {{reminded him of}} his homeland. [...] He asked his brother Theo to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands, named Tersteeg. Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague. [...] He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien.|$|E
500|$|... "Today" [...] {{is written}} in the key of E-flat major (E) and played in {{standard}} tuning. While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a half-step and playing the song {{as if it were}} in the key of E, he said, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> E voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." [...] "Today" [...] is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan [...] "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20." ...|$|E
500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but {{kept coming back to}} Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see I {{may as well}} lay aside my gown, and own the marling-spike!" [...] {{returned}} the other, smiling, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trade--profession, though, I believe, is your favourite word--there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> profession, which betrays us to each other. Yes, Mr Wilder," [...] he added with dignity motioning to his guest to imitate his example, and take a seat, [...] "I am, like yourself, a seaman bred and happy am I to add, the Commander of this gallant vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she is tall--very tall," [...] Ralph said, very gravely; [...] "but there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{expression}} {{of your eyes}} which reminds me of Mrs. Klopstock.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere--the aura, shall I say?--that {{emanates from}} a good woman that makes a man feel that life has a new, a {{different}} meaning." ...|$|R
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, but there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} {{entertainment}} industry magazine Variety praised The Projected Man, writing that the screenplay [...] "is a mosaic compiled from other films but the pieces hang together fairly well." [...] However, Variety criticised the character's motives, saying that [...] "the origin and motives {{of the third}} party are never fully explained." [...] The magazine wrote that the performances in the film were [...] "generally good," [...] and that [...] "the characters do not fall prey to the usual cliches." [...] Writing for Ottawa Citizen, Gordon Stoneham, reviewing the double bill of The Projected Man and Island of Terror, called The Projected Man [...] "dreadful stuff," [...] saying that the film was [...] "badly written, woodenly acted, and abounding in the cliches of the horror film genre." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "it is short and to the point" [...] and wrote that [...] "although it trods a familiar path, {{every now and then}} it comes up with some arresting bit of cinematic coloring that rivels the attention." [...] Comparing the two films, he stated that The Projected Man was [...] "the best." [...] A TV Guide review wrote that the [...] "characters are better portrayed than usual in films of this nature, keeping the actors from becoming mere stereotypes" [...] and that [...] "subtle artistic direction and first-quality special effects give this picture a strong visual presence." [...] The review graded The Projected Man with two stars out of four. The anonymous reviewer for the British Kinematograph Weekly called the cast [...] "competent" [...] and noted that, while the [...] "plot [...] at least as old as H. G. Wells", there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film that would challenge the [...] "hard-boiled child of today".|$|E
60|$|I {{was startled}} with this plain-dealing; yet, there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{manner of the}} man that {{prevented}} my being displeased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let it be," [...] said Marie pointedly, fixing {{her black}} {{magnetic}} {{eyes on the}} wicked stranger, [...] "let it <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> DISCOVERY of gold, or a buried TREASURE HOARD, or a robbery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] said Harris, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> British Sunday {{that appeals}} to the man with English blood in his veins. I should be sorry to see it {{altogether}} done away with, let the new generation say what it will." ...|$|R
60|$|Our own {{personal}} theory, {{based upon a}} careful comparison of similarities, is that the good old man is in reality the stage hero grown old. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> good old man's chuckle-headed simplicity, about his helpless imbecility, and his irritating damtom foolishness that is strangely suggestive of the hero.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> poor, foolish painted face, as {{it looked}} up pleadingly, that gave it a {{momentary}} touch of beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a fool Rawdon Crawley has been," [...] Clump replied, [...] "to go {{and marry}} a governess! There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> girl, too." ...|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man's {{voice and}} manner that scared the female savage before him, fierce as she was, {{and she sat}} down.|$|E
60|$|JOANNA. You <b>were</b> saying <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> devotion of a lifetime; {{please go}} on.|$|R
6000|$|... "You deal in metaphors, Warrington," [...] Pen said; [...] "but you rightly {{say that}} you are very prosaic. Poor Shandon! There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{kindness}} of that man, and the gentleness of that sweet creature of a wife, which touches me profoundly. I like him, I am afraid, better than a better man." ...|$|R

60|$|Lister lighted a {{cigarette}} and listened. A monotonous, rhythmic throb stole into the room, and he felt there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> noise that jarred.|$|E
60|$|Montmorency {{does not}} lack pluck; but there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> look of that cat {{that might have}} chilled {{the heart of the}} boldest dog. He stopped abruptly, and looked back at Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Escaped prisoners {{being run}} down," [...] muttered Bolle, but Cicely took no heed. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of the rider of the grey horse that seemed to draw her heart out of her.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Thomas Nagel has {{supported}} Sokal and Bricmont, describing their book as consisting largely of [...] "extensive quotations of scientific gibberish from name-brand French intellectuals, together with eerily patient explanations {{of why it}} is gibberish," [...] and agreeing that [...] "there does seem to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Parisian scene that is particularly hospitable to reckless verbosity." ...|$|R
40|$|There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{poetry of}} Elizabeth Campbell that syncopates like an idling Harley Davidson. In the poem “destiny”, written mainly in lines of {{fourteen}} to sixteen syllables, {{the urge to}} settle into a steady iambic rhythm is constantly frustrated, only to return again to its regular beat before once again hopping sideways in distinctive fitfulness...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{speak to}} dad about it," [...] {{answered}} Jack quickly. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Franklins which had pleased him {{ever since he}} had first known them. They appeared {{to be perfectly honest}} and reliable.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis {{considered}} the matter for a moment, thoughtfully. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea of letting Mr. Wadham see him sign a promissory note for forty thousand pounds which {{occurred to him}} as somewhat precarious.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn smiled. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man which {{appealed to}} her. Perhaps {{it was the}} mystery that seemed to shroud him and the Enchantress. She noticed {{now that he was}} casting furtive glances about the dining-room.|$|E
6000|$|He was one {{of those}} men whose face {{suggests}} the word [...] "muzzle," [...] with an erect combative nose and a forward slant of the body from the rather inturned feet. He wore an observant bowler hat a little too small for him, and there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tail of his jacket--as though he had been docked.|$|R
6000|$|... [28] There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> word {{blood at}} which the mind recoils, as if {{intended}} to impress upon us the evils of sin and its awful punishment--the death, spiritual and eternal, of the sinner. 'Without shedding of blood is no remission.' Blessed are those who were in Christ when his precious blood was shed as an atoning sacrifice.--Ed.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Spence {{admitted}} that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> cosey <b>about</b> <b>the</b> custom, {{when it was}} well done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{suppose he}} doesn't?" [...] Saul asked sulkily, but yet {{following}} little Frenchie nevertheless, for there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lad which caused {{you to do}} that which pleased him whether it was to your liking or not.|$|E
60|$|He {{moved off}} with an {{important}} nod. He was tired of Lord Wisbeach's society. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> young man {{which he did not}} like. He went to find more congenial company in a group by the window.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man's easy {{confidence}} which was, in its way, impressive yet irritating. Helen appeared {{bereft of}} words and retreated to her place almost mildly. Philippa's very delicate eyebrows were drawn together in a slight frown.|$|E
60|$|Owen {{spent his}} boyhood in the Shropshire village of which {{his father had}} been rector, and thither he went when his holiday came round, to the farm of one Dorman. He was glad of the chance to get to Shropshire. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country there, with its green fields and {{miniature}} rivers, that soothes the wounded spirit and forms a pleasant background for sentimental musings.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose and}} {{imprinted}} a solemn kiss upon his forehead. There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> sacramental <b>about</b> <b>the</b> deliberate caress.|$|R
5000|$|... "Outside of any {{national}} feelings, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> red cap of the Corps of Military Police {{that makes it}} resemble the proverbial red rag, particularly if a man has had a few drinks. The hat with the blue puggaree worn by our Provost Corps was much less offensive...as time went and men become tougher and war-weary, {{the arrival of the}} CMP undoubtedly caused irritation and sometimes bred increased violence." ...|$|R
