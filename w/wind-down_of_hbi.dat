40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} use {{models to}} aid in predicting high risk areas for human and black bear (Ursus americanus) interactions (HBI). These tools help managers implement management strategies to minimize HBI. Over 3, 000 incidents <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> were compiled from management reports at Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) during 1998 - 2011, a park with 9 - 10. 2 million visitors per year and a black bear population of about 1, 600 bears. We used data from bear management reports along with annual visitor use, mast and bear abundance data to develop a series of generalized linear models to assess the spatial and temporal factors affecting HBI. Although HBI occurred throughout the GSMNP, 50 % <b>of</b> all <b>HBI</b> occurred in five areas. The best predictor variables <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> across four subsets of models included interaction between mast production and number of park visitors, month, vegetation cover, visitor activity, and bear abundance. Although {{there was not a}} clear relationship between visitor use and mast abundance, the number of park visitors was always relatively high and HBI increased substantially in poor mast years. HBI was more frequent during summer months when park visitation rates and more people and food were present overnight in frontcountry and backcountry camping areas. Over 43 % <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> in hemlock forests were serious. Bear abundance data were not a strong predictor <b>of</b> <b>HBI,</b> and bear bait stations may not provide a sensitive index to bear abundance. GSMNP uses different strategies for managing HBI to protect visitors and bears. In 1991, bear proof waste disposal containers and food storage devices were placed in camping and picnic areas. In combination with aversive conditioning, HBI decreased in some areas of the park. We recommend that proactive bear management programs including education, enforcement of park regulations, and aggressive aversion conditioning of bears be implemented at the identified HBI high risk areas to provide a safer environment for both people and bears in GSMNP...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) as a {{feed stock}} to electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking presents significant challenges to producers in terms of energy usage and productivity. In this context, the University of Wollongong has been studying {{the use of the}} hot off gases from EAF's for the preheating of RBI feed to an EAF. Of particular concern is the potential for excessive oxidation <b>of</b> the <b>HBI</b> from the hot oxidised gases.

40|$|Hyphal {{cells of}} three fungal {{species of the}} genus Penicillium reduced the nonpermeable, {{external}} electron acceptor hexabromoiridate IV (HBI IV). In Penicillium cyclopium, the rate <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> IV reduction by hyphal cells was drastically increased {{by the addition of}} beta-glucose. The stimulation showed high specificity for this sugar and did not require its uptake and cellular metabolism. Cell wall oxidases (e. g., glucose oxidase) {{did not seem to be}} involved in the reduction <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> IV, as no measurable H 2 O 2 was formed from added glucose and removal of oxygen had no effect. We propose that there is a glucose-binding component outside the plasma membrane which controls transmembrane electron fluxes in response to external glucose. Reduction <b>of</b> <b>HBI</b> IV was accompanied by rapid acidification of the cellular interior (measured by confocal pH topography). Subsequently, the outer medium was acidified of the cellular interior (measured by confocal pH topography). Subsequently, the outer medium was acidified with an e-/H+ stoichiometry of > 1. In plasma membrane vesicles containing endogenous electron donors, the membrane-residing fluoroprobe Di- 8 -ANEPPS reported a transient depolarization of the membrane potential triggered by the external electron acceptor. Inhibitors of ATP-dependent proton pumping enhanced the extent of this depolarization, inhibited the subsequent normalization of membrane potential, and, in whole cells, reduced the amount of redox-triggered proton extrusion. From these and other findings, it is concluded that the observed trans-plasma membrane redox process activates the H(+) -ATPase via membrane depolarization and cytosolic acidification...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative binding of ligands to {{proteins}} {{can serve}} to increase their efficiency and to regulate their activity. Thus, understanding of the mechanism of cooperativity {{is one of the}} central concerns of molecular biology. For the tetrameric human hemoglobin (HbA), the cooperative mechanism involves a reasonably well understood combination of tertiary and quaternary changes that occur during the binding process. The dimeric hemoglobin <b>of</b> Scapharca (<b>HbI),</b> which is composed of subunits with the same fold as in HbA, is also highly cooperative but the structural changes on ligand binding are small. A re-orientation of Phe 97 in the binding pocket and changes in the number of interfacial water moleculess have been implicated in the cooperative mechanism. To explore the role of these factors, we have investigated models of partially liganded inter-mediate states <b>of</b> <b>HbI</b> with molecular dynamics simulation methods. Since, unlike HbA, no structures for intermediates are available, they were constructed by combining subunits from the unliganded and liganded dimers. Two structurally distinct intermediates were examined, and it was shown that the transition between the two intermediates is directly coupled to the number of interfacial water molecules. Further, it was found that there is a well-defined water channel that connects the interface between the subunits to bulk water. The bottleneck (gate) of the channel, which can be open or closed, is made of hydrophilic residues. The implication of the present results for the cooperative mechanism <b>of</b> <b>HbI</b> is discussed...|$|R
