Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for <b>when</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> hard.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, since the workers must compete for employment, it inevitably follows {{that it is}} the fit and {{efficient}} who find employment. The skilled worker holds his place by virtue of his skill and efficiency. Were he less skilled, or were he unreliable or erratic, he would be swiftly replaced by a stronger competitor. The skilled and steady employments are not cumbered with clowns and idiots. A man finds his place according to his ability and the needs of the system, and those without ability, or incapable of satisfying the needs of the system, have no place. Thus, the poor telegrapher may develop into an excellent wood-chopper. But if the poor telegrapher cherishes the delusion that he is a good telegrapher, {{and at the same time}} disdains all other employments, he will have no employment at all, or he will be so poor at all other employments that he will work only now and again in lieu of better men.

I am a very young man. I have grown up among you, and of you, and now in a strange way, due in a great measure to the kindness of your employers, and in a small degree to my own exertions to improve myself, I have come to be put over you. Now it is only by your helping me that I can maintain this position here. You will find in me a true friend. I know your difficulties and your wants, and I will do all in my power to render your lives comfortable. Those among you who were my friends from boyhood can believe this, the rest of you will find it to be so. Any of you who are in trouble or in difficulty will, if you come to me, obtain advice and assistance. But while I will try to be your friend, and will do all in my power for your welfare, it is absolutely necessary that you should treat me with the respect due to Mr. Brook's manager. Without proper discipline proper work is impossible. A captain must be captain of his own ship though many of his men know the work as well as he does. And I am glad {{to be able to tell}} you that Mr. Brook has given me full power to make such regulations and to carry out such improvements as may be conducive to your comfort and welfare. He wants, and I want, the Vaughan to be a model mine and Stokebridge a model village, and we will do all in our power to carry out our wishes. We hope that no dispute will ever again arise here on the question of wages. There was one occasion when the miners of the Vaughan were led away by strangers and paid dearly for it. We hope that such a thing will never occur again. Mr. Brook expects a fair return, and no more than a fair return, for the capital he has sunk in the mine. <b>When</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> good you will share his prosperity, <b>when</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> bad you, like he, must submit to sacrifices. If disputes arise elsewhere, they need not affect us here, for you may be sure that your wages will never be below those paid elsewhere. And now I have said my say. Let us conclude by trusting that we shall be as warm friends as ever although our relations towards each other are necessarily changed." ...|$|E

The girls in all their finery wanted a deal of sitting-room, with their starched {{petticoats}} standing out over their hips, and their bare arms and necks shone with the vigorous application of yellow soap: and the smooth hair, fair and dark, had an additional lustre after the stiff brushing which it had to endure. The matrons wore darker skirts and black silk handkerchiefs tied round their heads, ending in a bow under the chin: but everywhere ribbons fluttered and beads jingled, and the men had spurs to their high boots which gave a pleasing clinking when they clapped their heels together. Overhead, hung to the ceiling, were festoons of bright pink paper roses and still brighter green glazed calico leaves; the tables were spread with linen cloths, and literally threatened to break down {{under the weight of}} pewter dishes filled with delicacies of every sort and kind--home-killed meat and home-made sausages, home-made bread and home-grown wine.

Just as it is on board a ship, so it is elsewhere. If our vessel had gone down that first voyage, any man who escaped drowning would have said that Bill Vokes had not been without reason in his warnings, and that it was nothing less than flying in the face of Providence, to put to sea when the loss of the ship had been so surely foretold.

40|$|Food {{production}} at home requires money and time. Food assistance programs focus {{exclusively on the}} money cost, while ignoring the time cost. This one-dimensional focus could undermine the effectiveness of food assistance programs. In the spirit of Vickery (1977), this paper uses a cost difference approach to develop a money-time threshold, and several related metrics, to determine whether money or <b>time</b> <b>is</b> the most limiting resource in reaching the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) target. In our empirical analysis we find that <b>when</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> ignored, single headed households spend on average 35 % more than required to meet the TFP target. However, <b>when</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> included, these households spend on average 40 % less than required to meet the TFP target. In addition, we find that <b>when</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> ignored, 62 % of single headed households on average spend enough money to reach the TFP target, but <b>when</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> included, only 13 % of single headed households spend enough on average to reach the TFP target. Our empirical results suggest that <b>time</b> <b>is</b> more constraining than money in reaching the TFP target. These results imply that metrics solely focusing on money could severely underestimate the gap between actual expenditures and those required to reach the TFP target.
