5|$|Ralph took {{up water}} polo {{at the age}} of thirteen, with her first {{competition}} being the Melville Flippaball Competition. She has a water polo scholarship from the Western Australian Institute of Sport. She plays in the centre back/driver positions and prefers to wear cap number eight. As a young player, she <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at 4am to get to the pool to train.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{attended}} Zionsville Community High School, {{where he}} became a star basketball player. He wore No. 31 {{in high school in}} honor of Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller. During his freshman year, he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early to practice shooting at a local gym before school. The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that same year. By the time his high school career was complete, Stevens had set school records for career scoring, assists, steals, and three-point field goals. As of 2010, he still holds the records for points (1508), assists (444), and steals (156), as well as the single-season points record (644 in 1995). Stevens was named to the all-conference team three times. In 1995, he was named the sectional MVP and was the leading scorer in state sectional play (32.3 ppg).|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{while playing}} a gig at the Pypo Club in Seaside, Oregon, the band noticed Rockin' Robin Roberts's version of [...] "Louie Louie" [...] being {{played on the}} jukebox for hours on end. The entire club <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance. Ely {{convinced}} the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response. Unknown to him, he changed the beat from 1-2-3-4, 1–2, 1-2-3-4, 1–2 to 1-2-3, 1–2, 1-2-3, 1–2 because he based it on the intro only. Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes. Dubbed [...] "The Chase", the Kingsmen became the club's house band and Ken Chase became the band's manager. Ely was begging Chase to let the band record {{their own version of}} [...] "Louie Louie", and on April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day. The band had just played a 90-minute [...] "Louie Louie" [...] marathon.|$|E
5000|$|Quite often Super Chicken and Fred <b>would</b> <b>get</b> blown <b>up.</b> Fred, {{standing}} at the exact center of the explosion would not be hurt while Super Chicken always was.|$|R
60|$|The time, now, was twenty-three {{minutes past}} twelve. The next half hour, at most, would decide the {{question}} of whether he would, or <b>would</b> not, <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from his bed, and leave the room.|$|R
50|$|A comedy {{show where}} Carl Hagan <b>would</b> <b>get</b> dressed <b>up,</b> sing songs and chat to players live in Legend of Mir. This was {{probably}} one of the most popular shows ever on Game Network and remains part of its legacy.|$|R
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou {{used the}} same [...] "writing ritual" [...] for many years. She <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> at {{five in the morning}} and check into a hotel room, where the staff were {{instructed}} to remove any pictures from the walls. [...] She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. [...] She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Lupton stated that this ritual indicated [...] "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to [...] "enchant" [...] herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". [...] She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: [...] "...Though easily read, [...] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, [...] "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" [...] She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in [...] "telling the truth".|$|E
2500|$|Abu Hurairah {{reported}} that Muhammad said: [...] "If you survive {{for a time}} you would certainly see people who would have whips in their hands like the tail of an ox. They <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in the morning under the wrath of God and they {{would go into the}} evening with the anger of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paulini named Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as {{her biggest}} musical {{influences}} growing up, stating that [...] "they demanded attention when they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{on stage and}} that is what I have always wanted when I get up and perform." [...] She also cited Beyoncé as an inspiration for performing, and Oprah Winfrey for [...] "her courage, talent and life lessons." [...] Paulini listed Beyoncé and Aretha Franklin as vocal inspirations for her album Superwoman (2006).|$|E
6000|$|Still Nancy was silent, looking down; and {{he almost}} {{expected}} that she <b>would</b> presently <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and say {{she would go to}} her father's. How could she have any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her, with her simple, severe notions? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, yes; but I don't suppose I shall. I {{was going}} to hunt every day last week, but my fellow never <b>would</b> <b>get</b> me <b>up</b> in time. I can't tell {{why it is that}} things are done in such a beastly way. Why shouldn't fellows begin to hunt at two or three, so that a fellow needn't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{in the middle of the}} night?' ...|$|R
50|$|Along with Lieutenant Commander Katherine Hitchcock, Lucas {{designed}} a new, one-person submarine, {{which he called}} the Stinger. Although Hitchcock wanted {{to call it the}} Gazelle, Lucas was adamant about calling it the Stinger, claiming that if he called it the Gazelle, he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> beaten <b>up.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As North explained, [...] "...there was a vogue of a soubrette, as {{we called}} her, singing on the stage, and a kid <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> from the gallery and sing the chorus. The Gallery Gods, of course, {{thought he was}} one of them and applauded loudly. I was the kid in the gallery. I had the voice and I could sing." [...] North {{traveled}} around the USA with the company playing in small town opera houses or theaters for one- or two-night stands. [...] He developed a song and dance act.|$|E
2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and leave. I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good friend of mine, and said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury is going to think of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. What do you mean you don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the aid of}} a £23,000 mortgage, Heseltine and Josephs now {{bought a}} group of five {{adjacent}} houses for £27,000 in Inverness Terrace, Bayswater. They arranged for some medical students to decorate and remodel the property into a 45-bedroom boarding house, which they called the [...] "New Court Hotel". Heseltine would sometimes cook breakfast himself, although he rejects tales that he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early to mix margarine in with the butter. Many of tenants were American servicemen who, he later recorded, were for the most part respectful but sometimes rowdy at weekends.|$|E
60|$|The dainty {{concoction}} {{to which}} the blazing-eyed old lady now applied herself was something she had never before tasted, and she became {{of the opinion that}} Kipper <b>would</b> not <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a dish of that sort, and so much of it, for less than two dollars.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it," [...] {{answered}} Alice, very emphatically. [...] "As soon as I {{told her}} what it was she covered up her head with the bedclothes and declared, ma'am, that she <b>would</b> never <b>get</b> <b>up</b> until they were entirely gone out of the house." ...|$|R

2500|$|Razor Smith (William Charles Smith; 4 October 1877, Oxford, Oxfordshire – 15 July 1946, Bermondsey, London) was a Surrey slow bowler. Nicknamed [...] "Razor" [...] {{because of}} his extreme thinness, Smith was prone to serious injury and could rarely get through a full season's cricket, but when sound, could command the sharpest off-break among bowlers of his day. He was also able to bowl a {{somewhat}} faster ball with a very high flight that turned a little from leg and, with any help from the pitch, <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> almost straight.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampusch's {{official}} statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. Later, when explaining {{that in general}} she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 2009, Han posted {{an article}} on his blog {{entitled}} Request for articles, recruitment, article fees and article submission email address for a new magazine. [...] The post mentioned that Han would be setting up a magazine, informing the email addresses for article submission, response to recruitment ads, and advertising offers, but without revealing the magazine's title to prevent illegal copying. [...] The blog post also mentioned that the writer of the selected cover story, if the story had not been previously published, <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to RMB 2,000 per 1,000 characters in article fees. [...] This would be 10 to 40 times of the standard rate in China's publishing industry, and 2 to 4 times higher than what China's top magazine would pay China's top writer for an article. [...] Writers of previously unpublished non-cover story articles in the magazine would be paid RMB 1,000 per 1,000 characters, 10 to 20 times higher than standard rates in the publishing industry. [...] As for previously-published articles or selected extracts from articles, the rate would be RMB 500 per 1,000 characters, which would be about 15 times the standard rates. [...] Contributors of photographs would be paid up to RMB 5,000 per photograph.|$|E

2500|$|In the WomensWallStreet articles, Jacobsen {{detailed}} the activity {{she took to}} be suspicious. She claimed that before boarding, the men did not interact or seem {{to be part of}} a group. [...] Further, she claimed that during boarding, each man made eye contact with each of the others and nodded as if in agreement. One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats. Once in flight, one of the men took a large McDonald's bag to a lavatory, exiting with the bag nearly empty, and giving the thumbs up sign as he passed two other suspicious men. Some of the other men also took objects with them to the lavatory, such as a mass of cloth, a camera, and a cell phone. Throughout the flight, the men <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in unison, walk to the lavatories, and congregate in the aisles in groups of two and three. One of the men, wearing a suit and sunglasses, stood a foot or so away from the cockpit door. When the captain announced clearance for landing, seven of the men stood in unison and went to the lavatory, each taking about four minutes. The last man to exit the lavatory supposedly dragged his forefinger across his neck as he passed one of the other men, mouthing the word [...] "No." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Stephen Colbert facetiously asked Simon why {{the narrator}} of the song <b>would</b> need to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and wash his face after making love. Simon noted [...] "Well, it’s the ’60s, so I can’t remember." ...|$|R
50|$|Moving to RKO Radio Pictures in 1934, he {{continued}} to make six shorts per year {{until his death in}} 1951. Most of these were marital farces in which Leon <b>would</b> <b>get</b> mixed <b>up</b> with a pretty girl or an involved business proposition, and face the wrath of his wife (usually Dorothy Granger); the theme tune to the series was the nursery rhyme, London Bridge Is Falling Down.|$|R
