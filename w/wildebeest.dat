5|$|In {{terms of}} skull length, the {{smallest}} subspecies {{of the blue}} <b>wildebeest</b> is the western white-bearded <b>wildebeest.</b> It is also the darkest subspecies, the eastern white-bearded <b>wildebeest</b> being the lightest race. Both these subspecies possess a creamy white beard, whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland <b>wildebeest</b> and the common <b>wildebeest.</b> The longest muzzles {{are found in the}} Nyassaland <b>wildebeest,</b> and the shortest in female western white-bearded <b>wildebeest.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, one species of the <b>wildebeest,</b> Connochaetes albojubatus, was {{identified}} in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the <b>wildebeest</b> were introduced, namely Gorgon a. albojubatus ("Athi white-bearded wildebeest") and G. a. mearnsi ("Loita white-bearded wildebeest"). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus. In the mid-twentieth century, two separate forms were recognised, Gorgon taurinus hecki and G. t. albojubatus. Finally two distinct types of <b>wildebeest</b> – the blue and black <b>wildebeest</b> – were identified. The blue <b>wildebeest</b> was at first placed under a separate genus, Gorgon, while the black <b>wildebeest</b> belonged to the genus Connochaetes. Today they are united in the single genus Connochaetes: the black <b>wildebeest</b> being named (C. gnou) and the blue <b>wildebeest,</b> (C. taurinus).|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> (Connochaetes taurinus), {{also called}} the common <b>wildebeest,</b> white-bearded <b>wildebeest</b> or brindled gnu, is a large {{antelope}} {{and one of the}} two species of <b>wildebeest.</b> It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black <b>wildebeest.</b> The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is known to have five subspecies. This broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust muzzle. Young blue <b>wildebeest</b> are born tawny brown, and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish brown. Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns.|$|E
5|$|This {{species of}} <b>wildebeest</b> {{seems to have}} evolved around 2.5 million years ago. The black <b>wildebeest</b> is {{believed}} to have diverged from the blue <b>wildebeest</b> to become a distinct species around a million years ago, in the mid to late Pleistocene. Fossil evidence suggests that the blue <b>wildebeest</b> were quite common in the Cradle of Humankind in the past. Apart from eastern Africa, fossils are commonly found in Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad.|$|E
5|$|Blue <b>wildebeest</b> fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are {{plentiful}} at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black <b>wildebeest</b> were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue <b>wildebeest</b> are recognised while the black <b>wildebeest</b> has no named subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is {{native to}} Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Today it is extinct in Malawi, but has been {{successfully}} reintroduced in Namibia. The southern limit of the blue <b>wildebeest</b> range is the Orange River, while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya. The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is widespread and is being introduced into private game farms, reserves and conservancies. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) rates the blue <b>wildebeest</b> as being of Least Concern. The population has been estimated to be around {{one and a half}} million and the population trend is stable.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, <b>wildebeest</b> used to roam widely, {{probably}} in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue <b>wildebeest</b> but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the <b>wildebeest</b> only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black <b>wildebeest</b> are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|Black <b>wildebeest</b> act as hosts to {{a number}} of {{external}} and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of <b>wildebeest</b> calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black <b>wildebeest</b> showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|C. t. taurinus (Burchell, 1823; Blue <b>wildebeest,</b> common <b>wildebeest</b> or brindled gnu) {{is found}} in {{southern}} Africa. Its range extends from Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique (north of the Orange River) and from southwestern Zambia (south of the Zambezi river) to southern Angola.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue <b>wildebeest</b> have a long-distance migration, {{seemingly}} timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), <b>wildebeest</b> migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, <b>wildebeest</b> select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, <b>wildebeest</b> select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|Groups of <b>wildebeest</b> {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas {{established}} by the male. When groups of <b>wildebeest</b> join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E
5|$|In the Maasai Mara game reserve, {{there is}} a {{non-migratory}} population of blue <b>wildebeest</b> which had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline {{is thought to be}} the increasing competition between cattle and <b>wildebeest</b> for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices, and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Movies and {{television}} shows also feature wildebeests, including Khumba (Mama V), The Wild (Kazar and his minions), All Hail King Julien (Vigman <b>Wildebeest),</b> The Great Space Coaster (newscaster Gary Gnu), and The Lion King (the <b>wildebeest</b> stampede that resulted in Mufasa's death).|$|E
5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue <b>wildebeest</b> were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue <b>wildebeest,</b> and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue <b>wildebeest</b> are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>wildebeest</b> is a herbivore, {{and almost}} the whole diet {{consists}} of grasses. Water {{is an essential}} requirement. There are three distinct social groups: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial bulls. They are fast runners, and communicate {{using a variety of}} visual and vocal communication. The primary breeding season for the black <b>wildebeest</b> is from February to April. A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother until her next calf is born a year later. The black <b>wildebeest</b> inhabits open plains, grasslands and Karoo shrublands.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>wildebeest</b> is {{depicted}} on the {{coat of arms}} of the Province of Natal in South Africa. Over the years the South African authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a two cent piece with a prancing black <b>wildebeest.</b>|$|E
5|$|The black <b>wildebeest</b> {{is known}} to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative, the blue <b>wildebeest.</b> Male black <b>wildebeest</b> have been {{reported}} to mate with female blue <b>wildebeest</b> and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily}} on the short grasses which commonly grow on light, and alkaline soils that are found in savanna grasslands and on plains. The animal's broad mouth is adapted for eating large quantities of short grass and it feeds both {{during the day and}} night. When grass is scarce, it will also eat the foliage of shrubs and trees. <b>Wildebeest</b> commonly associate with plains zebras as the latter eat the upper, less nutritious grass canopy, exposing the lower, greener material which the <b>wildebeest</b> prefer. Whenever possible, the <b>wildebeest</b> likes to drink twice daily and due to its regular requirement for water, it usually inhabits moist grasslands and areas with available water sources. The blue <b>wildebeest</b> drinks 9 to 12 litres of water every one to two days. Despite this, it can also survive in the arid Kalahari desert, where it obtains sufficient water from melons and water-storing roots and tubers.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of blue <b>wildebeest</b> is {{estimated}} to be around 1,550,000. The population trend overall is stable and the numbers in the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) have increased to about 1,300,000. The population density ranges from 0.15/km2 in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park where they are most plentiful. Blue <b>wildebeest</b> have also been introduced into a number of private game farms, reserves and conservancy areas. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the blue <b>wildebeest</b> as being of Least Concern. However, the numbers of the eastern white-bearded <b>wildebeest</b> (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline in numbers to a current level of probably 6,000 to 8,000 animals and this is causing some concern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wildebeest</b> is the mascot of the GNU Project and GNU {{operating}} system.|$|E
5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black <b>wildebeest,</b> or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue <b>wildebeest,</b> or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue <b>wildebeest</b> remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black <b>wildebeest</b> changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring {{and in the way}} their horns are oriented.|$|E
5|$|Today, many <b>wildebeest</b> {{populations are}} {{experiencing}} rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the <b>wildebeest</b> population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue <b>wildebeest</b> share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black <b>wildebeest.</b>|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue <b>wildebeest</b> {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue <b>wildebeest</b> have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|C. t. albojubatus (Thomas, 1912; Eastern white-bearded <b>wildebeest),</b> {{is found}} in the Gregory Rift Valley (south of the equator). Its range extends from {{northern}} Tanzania to central Kenya.|$|E
5|$|C. t. cooksoni (Blaine, 1914; Cookson's <b>wildebeest),</b> is {{restricted}} to the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. Sometimes these animals may wander into the plateau region of central Malawi.|$|E
5|$|C. t. johnstoni (Sclater, 1896; Nyassaland <b>wildebeest),</b> occurs from Mozambique (north of the Zambezi river) to east-central Tanzania. This {{subspecies}} is now {{extinct in}} Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, {{ranging from a}} pale white (as in the Arabian oryx) to black (as in the black <b>wildebeest).</b> However, only the {{intermediate}} shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the <b>wildebeest,</b> the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} <b>wildebeest</b> {{is the most}} {{abundant}} big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black <b>wildebeest</b> is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. <b>Wildebeest</b> often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. <b>Wildebeest</b> are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> {{has also}} been rated as least-concern. The {{population}} trend is stable, and their numbers {{are estimated to be}} around 1,500,000 – mainly due to the increase of the populations in Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) to 1,300,000. However, the numbers of one of the subspecies, the Eastern white-bearded <b>wildebeest</b> (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline. Population density ranges from 0.15/km2. in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily}} on the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue <b>wildebeest</b> are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Three African populations of blue <b>wildebeest</b> take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> {{is mostly}} active {{during the morning}} and the late afternoon, with the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest. These {{extremely}} agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to , waving their tails and tossing their heads. An analysis of the activity of blue <b>wildebeest</b> at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest, 33% to grazing, 12% to moving about (mostly walking) and a little to social interactions. However, there were variations among different age and sex groups.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is {{native to}} Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. Today it is extinct in Malawi, but has been {{successfully}} reintroduced into Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The blue <b>wildebeest</b> is {{native to}} eastern and {{southern}} Africa. Its range includes Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. It is no longer found in Malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia. Blue <b>wildebeest</b> are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas, thriving {{in areas that are}} neither too wet nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. In East Africa, the blue <b>wildebeest</b> is the most abundant big game species, both in population and biomass. It is a notable feature of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} <b>wildebeest</b> is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female <b>wildebeest.</b> In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the <b>wildebeest</b> are known to hybridise. Male black <b>wildebeest</b> have been {{reported}} to mate with female blue <b>wildebeest</b> and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wildebeest</b> {{benefit the}} {{ecosystem}} by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important {{for human beings}} as they are a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The <b>wildebeest,</b> however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
