50|$|For example, the {{bluegill}} sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) has {{the choice}} of foraging on plankton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> safety of <b>reeds</b> or on benthic invertebrates which are a better quality food source. When a predator (the largemouth bass) is present, smaller sunfish spend {{the majority of their}} time foraging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> despite this choice reducing their food intake and seasonal growth rate. Sunfish that are too large to be eaten by the bass forage almost entirely on benthos. Although staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> means a slower growth rate and a longer period of being a size vulnerable to predators, for maximum survival sunfish choose to remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> feeding on plankton until they reach a certain size and then leave to feed on benthos.|$|R

40|$|Predation is {{a strong}} dective force on {{invertebrate}} prey. Asellus aquaticus differs in pigmentation reed and submerged vegetation habitats in lakes. Light pigmented individuals al vegetation dominated by Chara sp. while dark pigmented individuals dominate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds.</b> These differences have been hypothesized to result from background matching. Predation pressure from fish is belived to be highest in Chara sp., while invertebrate predators are more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds.</b> <b>In</b> this study I investigatedif predation from perch and damselfly larvae create different se 1 ection pressure on pigmentation {{and size of the}} Asellus, and if selection is affected by the structure of the habitat. The study vas carried out in aquaria in a loboratory. Regarding predation from perch a tendancy to be selective against dark pigmented individuals in Chara substrate was seen. Mortality increased with body size in Asellus, regardless of pigmentation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> experiment mortality of Asellus decreased with body length. The results illdicate that it is not as important for Asellus to be cryptic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> since it is not exposed to visual predation on the same level as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chara sp. where it is preferable to be small and cryptic. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> large individuals are probably favorued since common predators, such as damselfly larvae, are size-limited in their prey choice...|$|R

50|$|The {{first rule}} is ‘treat anyone {{in my home}} as kin.’ This rule is readily seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> warbler, a bird species that will only focus on chicks in their own nest.

This rule can {{sometimes}} lead to odd results, especially {{if there is a}} parasitic bird that lays eggs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> warbler nest.
