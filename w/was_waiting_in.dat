5|$|Hasekura {{stayed for}} 5 months in Mexico {{on his way}} back to Japan. The San Juan Bautista <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, in order to avoid too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the {{proceeds}} to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E

5|$|It later {{emerged that}} Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland {{a seat on}} the Supreme Court, and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> the {{expectation}} that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} afternoon, Monday, April 9, Dillinger had {{an appointment}} at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first. She was promptly arrested by agents, {{but refused to}} reveal Dillinger's whereabouts. Dillinger <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> his car outside the tavern and then drove off unnoticed. The two would never see each other again.|$|E
25|$|In Glasgow John Craig led around 30 men to {{make for}} the Carron Company {{ironworks}} in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, telling them that weapons would {{be there for the}} taking, but the group scattered when intercepted by a police patrol. By coincidence a detachment of Hussars <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> ambush with the intention of catching men marching off from Glasgow to Carron, but was disappointed. Craig was caught, brought before a magistrate and fined, but the magistrate paid his fine for him.|$|E

25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> the car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle {{unleashed}} a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm as she <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, {{she became the}} first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6 she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, she was not the first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993. She would also cover that same World Series but for a different network, ABC Sports.|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire's strong {{challenge}} for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.|$|E

500|$|While the New England {{colonies and}} New York {{dispatched}} a force overland against Montreal, which accomplished virtually nothing, Massachusetts launched a separate expedition against Quebec. The whole operation had been financed by issuing paper bonds {{set against the}} expected booty to be taken from the city. The expedition consisted of about 32 ships (only four of which were of any size) and over 2,300 Massachusetts militiamen, and was under the overall command of Phips, the victor at Port Royal. [...] Its departure was delayed until quite late in the summer because it <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> (<b>in</b> vain) {{for the arrival of}} additional munitions from England. Consequently, when Phips' expedition set out from Hull on 20 August, it was inadequately supplied with ammunition. Bad weather, contrary winds, and lack of pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River hampered progress, and Phips did not anchor in the Quebec basin until 16 October.|$|E
500|$|Five of the convoy's {{surviving}} merchant ships reached Gibraltar; 10 {{retreated to}} neutral Portugal. This {{was described as}} [...] "a bitter act of surrender could ever come our way". In Lisbon Lanahrones crew went on strike, which was resolved with extra life-rafts and pay. The crew of Irish Poplar <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> Lisbon; when the remnants of OG 71 limped in. The crew of Irish Poplar resolved to sail home alone. While City of Dublin brought Clonlaras survivors to Cork, Lanahrone joined Convoy HG 73. Nine of the 25 ships in that convoy were lost. These experiences and {{the inability of the}} Royal Navy to protect merchant ships had a most profound effect on all Irish Ships. Thereafter they were blacked out when sailing in Allied convoys. Ship-owners, on the advice of their masters, decided not to sail their vessels in British convoys and by the early months of 1942 the practice had ceased.|$|E
