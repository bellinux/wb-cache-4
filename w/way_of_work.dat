It had clashed with MƒÅori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley, to the south-east of Nelson and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, were killed. The company needed to scout the area to the south-west and Heaphy finally got the chance to explore.|$|E
2500|$|From 19201930, {{an issue}} arose {{concerning}} {{the publication of}} works that {{were not included in}} Iakovos Polylas' edition such as The Woman of Zakynthos, the satirical The Gallows and several Italian sonnets that were published by K. Kairofylas in 1927. [...] The Academy of Athens decided to publish Solomos' poems accompanied by a critical edition by N.B. Tomadakis, thus contributing to the discussion about whether a genuine (as Linos Politis was in favor of) or a critical edition of Solomos' works would be best. The critical edition was never published and the two classical scholars prepared [...] "easy to use" [...] editions of the poems, aiming at a wider range of readers. In 1964, Linos Politis published the poet's manuscripts using photographic reprint and typographical transcription. [...] This edition constitutes a turn-point in the research on the Solomian works because not only was the poet's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> revealed but also because the scholars had the opportunity to study all of the poet's editing phases and maybe even propose new editions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the association between aspects <b>of</b> New <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> and work ethics. The aspects include telework and autonomy in work hours. Hypotheses were derived from the social exchange theory of Blau (1964) and from findings of previous literature. We used the second wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (2006 - 2007), which contains 2847 respondents, to test our hypotheses. The results show a positive association between telework and work ethics and a positive association between autonomy in work hours and work ethics. We did not find differences in strength of the association between telework and autonomy in work hours. Moreover, no gender {{differences were found in}} this study. Although New <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> is a popular concept in the Netherlands, not much research had focused on the association between New <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> and work ethics.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study {{investigated}} The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> from individual perspective based on three basic psychological needs; autonomy, relatedness, competence of self-determination theory. The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> {{is a combination}} of social, physical and virtual dimension. This study emphasised the people role in NWoW by positioning them as a separate dimension and approached from moti- vation theories. By satisfying three basic psychological needs, the essential nutriments for psychological well-being and growth, people can be motivated to perform better work activities. The study builds the connection of the workplace context to the motivation of people by identifying the basic needs that drive individuals to implement The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> socially, physically, or virtually. METHODOLOGY The research design is exploratory qualitative and undertaken at 17 third places, which were coffee shops and coworking spaces within a period of four week collecting data. 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted, 15 in Vietnam and 12 in Finland. Content analysis and user profiling were used to analyse and interpret the collected data. FINDINGS The findings demonstrate diverse individual drivers <b>of</b> The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> in Finland and Vietnam. Based on a set of various factors including nationality, age group, psychological climate, authority or job characteristics, an individual would create an environment through social, physical or virtual dimension, in which their psychological need can be supported. Six individual profiles <b>of</b> The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> based on three basic psychological needs were identified in this research: engagers are driven by the feeling of being related; self-governers want to feel autonomous while free-goers, team-builders, and task-doers only concentrate to fulfil their competence need. In contrast, passiviers are not driven to implement The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> to satisfy their basic psychological needs. In practice, this study proposes a framework of the user profiles based on psychological needs, from which organisations can understand the motivation of workers to implement suitable The New <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>Working</b> practices...|$|R

60|$|The day was Sunday, and Merton, {{who had a}} holy {{horror of}} news, rejoiced {{to think that the}} telegraphic machine would {{probably}} not tinkle its bell for twenty-four hours. This was not the ideal of the millionaire. Things happen, intelligence arrives from the limits of our vast and desirable empire, even on the Day of Rest. But the electric bell was silent. Mr. Macrae, from patriotic motives, employed a Highland engineer and mechanician, so {{there was nothing to be}} got out of him in the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on the sabbath day. The millionaire himself did not quite understand how to work the thing. He went to the smoking-room where it dwelt and looked wistfully at it, but was afraid to try to call up his correspondents in London. As for the usual manipulator, Donald McDonald, he had started early for the distant Free Kirk. An 'Unionist' minister intended to try to preach himself in, and the majority of the congregation, being of the old Free Kirk rock, and averse to union with the United Presbyterians, intended to try to keep him out. They 'had a lad with the gift who would do the preaching fine,' and as there was no police-station within forty miles it seemed fairly long odds on the Free Kirk recalcitrants. However, there was a resolute minority of crofters on the side of the minister, and every chance of an ecclesiastical battle royal. Accompanied by the stalker, two keepers, and all the gardeners, armed with staves, the engineer had early set out for the scene of brotherly amity, and Mr. Macrae had reluctantly to admit that he was cut off from his communications.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{was very}} unhappy, {{and in his}} misery he went to Sir Thomas's chambers. This was about four o'clock in the day, at which hour Sir Thomas was almost always in his rooms. But Stemm with much {{difficulty}} succeeded in making him believe that the lawyer was not at home. Stemm at this time was much disturbed by his master's terrible resolution to try the world again, to stand for a seat in Parliament, and to put himself once more in the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and possible promotion. Stemm had condemned the project,--but, nevertheless, took glory in it. What if his master should become,--should become anything great and magnificent. Stemm had often groaned in silence,--had groaned unconsciously, that his master should be nothing. He loved his master thoroughly,--loving {{no one else in}} the whole world,--and sympathised with him acutely. Still he had condemned the project. [...] "There's so many of them, Sir Thomas, as is only wanting to put their fingers into somebody's eyes." [...] "No doubt, Stemm, no doubt," [...] said Sir Thomas; [...] "and as well into mine as another's." [...] "That's it, Sir Thomas." [...] "But I'll just run down and see, Stemm." [...] And so it had been settled. Stemm, who had always hated Ralph Newton, and who now regarded his master's time as more precious than ever, would hardly give any answer at all to Ralph's enquiries. His master might be at home at Fulham,--probably was. Where should a gentleman so likely be as at home,--that is, when he wasn't in chambers? [...] "Anyways, he's not here," [...] said Stemm, bobbing his head, and holding the door ready to close it. Ralph was convinced, then dined at his club, and afterwards went down to Fulham. He had heard nothing from Stemm, or elsewhere, of the intended candidature.|$|E

I {{have been working on}} the book with unremitting intensity the whole of every blessed morning since I began it, some thirteen months ago, and I am at present within but some twelve or fifteen thousand words of Finis. But I can work only in my own way--a deucedly good one, by the same token!--and am producing the best book, I seem to conceive, that I have ever done. I have really done it fast, for what it is, and for the way I do it--the way I seem condemned to; which is to overtreat my subject by developments and amplifications that have, in large part, eventually to be greatly compressed, but to the prior operation of which the thing afterwards owes what is most durable in its quality. I have written, in perfection, 200,000 words of the G.B.--with the rarest perfection!--and you can imagine how much of that, which has taken time, has had to come out. It is not, assuredly, an economical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the short run, but it is, for me, in the long; and at any rate one can proceed but in one's own manner. My manner however is, at present, to be making every day--it is now a question of a very moderate number of days--a straight step nearer my last page, comparatively close at hand. You shall have it, I repeat, with the very minimum further delay of which I am capable. I do not seem to know, by the way, when it is Methuen's desire that the volume shall appear--I mean after the postponements we have had.

60|$|May we not, {{to begin}} with, accept this great principle--that, as our bodies, {{to be in}} health, must be {{generally}} exercised, so our minds, to be in health, must be generally cultivated? You would not call a man healthy who had strong arms but was paralytic in his feet; nor one who could walk well, but had no use of his hands; nor one who could see well, {{if he could not}} hear. You would not voluntarily reduce your bodies to any such partially developed state. Much more, then, you would not, if you could help it, reduce your minds to it. Now, your minds are endowed with a vast number of gifts of totally different uses--limbs of mind as it were, which, if you don't exercise, you cripple. One is curiosity; that is a gift, a capacity of pleasure in knowing; which if you destroy, you make yourselves cold and dull. Another is sympathy; the power of sharing in the feelings of living creatures, which if you destroy, you make yourselves hard and cruel. Another of your limbs of mind is admiration; the power of enjoying beauty or ingenuity, which, if you destroy, you make yourselves base and irreverent. Another is wit; or the power of playing with the lights on the many sides of truth; which if you destroy, you make yourselves gloomy, and less useful and cheering to others than you might be. So that in choosing your <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> it should be your aim, as far as possible, to bring out all these faculties, as far as they exist in you; not one merely, nor another, but all of them. And the way to bring them out, is simply to concern yourselves attentively with the subjects of each faculty. To cultivate sympathy you must be among living creatures, and thinking about them; and to cultivate admiration, you must be among beautiful things and looking at them.|$|E

If in performing that duty he had sacrificed himself, he must bear his undeserved punishment like a man. That {{he was to be}} punished he began to perceive too clearly. The conviction that Mr. Daubeny must recede from the Treasury Bench after the coming debate became every day stronger, and within the little inner circles of the Liberal party the usual discussions were made as to the Ministry which Mr. Gresham would, as a matter of course, be called upon to form. But in these discussions Phineas Finn did not find himself taking an assured and comfortable part. Laurence Fitzgibbon, his countryman,--who in the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> had never been worth his salt,--was eager, happy, and without a doubt. Others of the old stagers, men who had been going in and out ever since they had been able to get seats in Parliament, stood about in clubs, and in lobbies, and chambers of the House, with all that busy, magpie air which is worn only by those who have high hopes of good things to come speedily. Lord Mount Thistle was more sublime and ponderous than ever, though they who best understood the party declared that he would never again be invited to undergo the cares of office. His lordship was one of those terrible political burdens, engendered originally by private friendship or family considerations, which one Minister leaves to another. Sir Gregory Grogram, the great Whig lawyer, showed plainly by his manner that he thought himself at last secure of reaching the reward for which he had been struggling all his life; for it was understood by all men who knew anything that Lord Weazeling was not to be asked again to sit on the Woolsack. No better advocate or effective politician ever lived; but it was supposed that he lacked dignity for the office of first judge in the land.
