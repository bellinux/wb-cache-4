Water jet propulsion(WJP) with {{positive}} displacement pump (PD pump), in which the suction thrust of PD pump (Due {{to the effect of}} pump suction and the influence of the suction boundary layer) and the reaction thrust of water jet are used to push watercraft forward, has many advantages like high efficiency,low noise, high maneuverability, good adaptability to variable working conditions, simple transmission mechanism over traditional propulsion methods. A mathematical model is developed and the WJP theory with PD pump is analyzed. Numerical studies are carried out to study the suction thrust, reaction thrust, and propulsion efficiency of the thruster with Bernoullihyperbolic suction inlet-PD pump-Bernoulli hyperbolic nozzle. The results show that: 1) in the conditions of no cavitation in suction inlet and constant flow rate, the suction thrust is inversely proportional to the inlet diameter and reaches around 8. 5 % of the total thrust; 2) the reaction thrust increases with the decrease of the nozzle diameter; 3) the pump-suction coefficient v is proportional to the speed ratio µ; 4) the efficiency of WJP with PD pump is higher than with negative displacement pump under the same speed ratio. The related conclusions provide a basis for the design of high performance <b>water</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{ships of}} design 1570 are {{operated}} in the Volga-Caspian Basin, their <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> comprise both the main engine 6 NVD 48 AU with silicone damp-er (B- 790) installed on "Nefterudovoz- 31 M", "Vicont", "Graf", "Markiz", etc {{and the main}} engine 6 NVD 48 A 2 U with silicone damper (A- 710) installed on "Nefterudovoz- 29 M". The discrete torsion scheme of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of the former ships differs from discrete torsion scheme of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of «Nefterudovoz- 29 M» by the diesel flywheel moment of inertia (flywheel ac-tion GDi 2 = 2 200 кg • m 2, instead GDi 2 = 1 200 кg • m 2). The analysis of torsion vibrations of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of the ship of design 1570 data on torsiographing have shown that without silicone damper the total stress {{as a result of}} torsion vibrations does not exceed the allowable limit throughout the whole engine speed range. Therefore the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of the ship of design 1570 can be operated without barred speed zones and without the necessity of installing torsion vibra-tion damper. The discrete torsion scheme of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of ship "Nefteru-dovoz- 31 M" without a damper should be considered to be preferable among the discrete torsion schemes of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> of the ship design 1570...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a part of a {{bachelor}} project which includes building, programming and controlling a 3 DOF tandem helicopter. This particular report deals with the <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> i. e. the motors and propellers of the helicopter. It covers the process of how to determine the most suitable <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> for the rig that eventually will enable it to run. To achieve this, different data have been processed. Torque and thrust are two important parameters that have been studied. The data have been acquired by different tests, e. g. thrust measurements from a thrust rig.

50|$|About a {{month after}} orbit insertion, after the Penetrators have been released, the orbiter would {{jettison}} its <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> would {{get in the way}} of the deployment of the LWR instrument and ARGUS platform and has to be jettisoned before the primary science phase can begin. The nominal mission of the orbiter would have lasted one Earth year. After the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> was jettisoned, the orbiter had a low power thrust system for orbit maintenance. During the nominal phase a fly-by of Deimos was possible, but a fly-by of Phobos was not possible until after the nominal mission. If an extended mission were approved, aerobraking over a period of two to three months would have reduced the orbital period to around nine hours.|$|R
50|$|Polaris {{features}} a novel propulsion system consisting of three electrically driven ABB Azipod <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> {{one of which}} is located in the bow of the vessel. The stern <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> are rated at 6.5megawatts each while the azimuth thruster in the bow has propulsion power of 6megawatts.

This new type of propulsion system was selected to fulfill the strict operational capability requirements set by the Finnish Transport Agency particularly in ridged ice fields. The combined propulsion power of the three <b>propulsion</b> <b>units,</b> , makes Polaris the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag as well as the most powerful icebreaker built specifically for escort operations in the Baltic Sea.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{discovery}} {{of the problem with}} the vessel’s propulsion system occurred when the Barberi’s chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision. The engineer found that even though the pitch levers were in the neutral position, the propeller pitch indicator for the New York-end unit read out 50% thrust. This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the <b>propulsion</b> <b>unit</b> to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units’ local controls to bring the pitch to zero. When the crew later attempted to back the Barberi out of the terminal using these local controls, both <b>propulsion</b> <b>units</b> functioned normally.|$|R
