5000|$|A {{group of}} railway enthusiasts had {{obtained}} an option from British Rail to reactivate the line {{as a private}} public railway between Grimsby and Louth. This option was granted prior to {{the publication of the}} road proposals. However, the railway supporters faced an impossible task in raising sufficient funds to replace the many tonnes of ballast that had been sold off by British Rail upon the closure of the line as a <b>working</b> <b>entity</b> and eventually conceded that their plan would not materialise. The group went on to form the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway on a smaller section of the trackbed south of Grimsby.|$|E

In 2004, Howard Werth, Keith Gemmell and Trevor Williams performed in Germany, Italy, Canada and the UK, replacing Tony Connor (who remained committed to Hot Chocolate) with drummer/vocalist John Fisher (born 8 December 1960, Buxton, Derbyshire - died 27 September 2008) and recording a live album alive&kickin&screamin&shoutin for Eclectic Records. During this period, Gemmell released two solo albums, The Windhover, inspired by a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Unsafe Sax, a tribute to his early 60s soul roots.|$|E
50|$|Teen Musical Theater began back in 2006 with {{a spring}} {{production}} of Grease. At {{that time the}} production was called Children's Musical Theater of Ashland (CMTA) until it was later renamed Children's Musical Theater of Oregon (CMTO). The company was founded by composer and keyboardist John Taylor and his wife Rhonda Taylor. His inspiration to found this organization came from the impact John P. Healy Jr. had on {{him when he was}} a part of San Jose Children's Musical Theater. Shortly after the 2008 summer production of Oklahoma!, Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was adopted by Craterian Performances. During the spring 2010 performance of Will Rogers Follies, a new branch of Children's Musical Theater of Oregon was created, called Teen Musical Theater of Oregon. While CMTO is still a <b>working</b> <b>entity</b> of the organization, it has taken a back seat allowing TMTO to produce the majority of the Musical Theater of Oregon's productions.|$|E
40|$|Philosophers have {{proposed}} {{various kinds of}} relations between Mendelian genetics and molecular biology: reduction, replacement, explanatory extension. This paper argues that the two fields are best characterized as investigating different, serially integrated, hereditary mechanisms. The mechanisms operate at different times and contain different <b>working</b> <b>entities.</b> The <b>working</b> <b>entities</b> of the mechanisms of Mendelian heredity are chromosomes, whose movements serve to segregate alleles and independently assort genes in different linkage groups. The <b>working</b> <b>entities</b> of numerous mechanisms of molecular biology are larger and smaller segments of DNA plus related molecules.

5000|$|When the British historian, Alfred Barnard {{visited the}} {{distillery}} {{not long after}} it opened in 1886, he reported that it was equipped {{with some of the}} best and most modern distilling equipment available at that time, and had a capacity of 800,000 gallons per annum. However, its output at that time was just 560,000 gallons, well below its potential. Barnard reported that whiskey from the distillery was exported to England, India and [...] "the Colonies".By 1891, just twenty-two years after its construction, financial difficulties forced the distillery to merge with two of the [...] "big four" [...] Dublin distilleries, William Jameson & Co.'s Marrowbone Lane Distillery, and George Roe & Co.'s Thomas Street Distillery to form the Dublin Distillers Company Limited. The amalgamated company had a combined potential capacity of 3.5 million gallons per year. However, it seems that the three distilleries continued to operated as competing concerns, without bringing about many savings due to economies of scale. Therefore, suffering from overcapacity, and without marque brands, the company continued to suffer financial difficulties. In particular, as the 1920s brought about the loss of both the American and British Commonwealth export markets during prohibition and the Anglo-Irish trade war. As a result, both the Thomas Street and Marrowbone Lane distilleries closed in 1923, with the Jones Road distillery following suit in 1926. Though as the most modern of the three plants, the Jones Road plant was likely retained as a <b>working</b> <b>entity,</b> and distilling may have continued at Jones Road until 1946.|$|E
5000|$|This second {{report has}} never been made public or {{discussed}} in any public arena. Some believe this bounty from government should {{be considered to be}} an undisclosed payment for ensuring Ireland's Internet future had apparently no hidden issues and no attached rumour of criminality of corrumption. This benefit also was that Telecom Eireann showed financial results well beyond expectations and these were used by promoters to hype Eircom shares sales which initially climbed to a high level after launch and their take up by many Irish citizens, being presented as the most successful public company launch in Ireland. Indigo was retained for some years as a separate internet company unit and had some key Eircom staff [...] "dropped" [...] into this. These key staff later returned to Eircom. After its absorption some years later into Eircom, it disappeared as a <b>working</b> <b>entity</b> except for some users who retained their email addresses. Questions into the original start up by Donal Moyna were highlighted by incidents such as the news that a man who Federal officials say {{was a member of the}} Irish Republican Army was being held on charges of carrying $13,500 in counterfeit $50 bills at La Guardia Airport, when arrested. The suspect, Donal Patrick Moyna, then 29 years old, of Dublin, was about to board a plane for Providence, R.I., when he was stopped by agents of the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said Andrew J. Maloney, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the online {{newspaper}} industry and the organisational changes that have been necessi-tated by economic downturn and natural evolution. It explains how online newspapers were created as virtual organisations (VO) by publishers to protect valuable franchises {{and in the early}} stages of the tech-nology boom were replicas of their traditional newspaper counterparts. It describes two VO structures that have applied during the online newspaper life cycle and the changes as economic pressures lead to de-structuring. This has resulted in convergence of publishing cultures with online and traditional disciplines working in a multi-skilling environment on two different products with similar content delivered through physical and electronic means. A model of the new <b>working</b> <b>entity</b> is provided. The paper concludes by raising cultural organisational issues relevant to a clash of journalistic disciplines...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} the work is {{revitalisation}} of the Brno rivers, specifically the river Svitava. The main idea {{of the work is}} the understanding the river as a city-building element, as a place of potential that every city should fully utilize. People like to spend their free time at the water and such a space should satisfy their needs. The river flows smoothly throught the city, and people should be able to move freely around it. In the ideal case, it should be a green path across urban area. The solved territory is situated in the Brno-Zábrdovice district, which hasn´t ideal reputation. Its image is shaped by, among others, industrial areas which are quite often derelict. My task was to correctly distribute one of these sites, which is located near the Zábrdovice Monastery. The solved territory is currently a non-coherent and inconsistent structure that does not support the image of the site. The river is completely supressed at this point and the movement around it is very limited. In my design I tried to create a place that would offer a lot of activities through the day. I have modified the functions I have in the territory and supported by my proposal to form a <b>working</b> <b>entity</b> together. In such a territory will meet people, who work or live here, who are using the services or come to sport or spend their free time in the pleasant environment of Svitava river...|$|E
40|$|There {{is no need}} {{to reinvent}} the wheel” – a cliché, often told when you want to come up with {{something}} new that in someway can be connected to something that already exist. This study shows the opposite – that inventions emanate from what is given. It can be a detail, a problem in a thing - a wheel - or a situation that catches the inventor’s attention. It is something that seeks a solution or something that generates an idea, a hint or a clue of something new and useful. The art of invention emerges from the ability and skill to broaden the seeing and put thinking, substance and tradition into motion. An old radio dial generates a new ergonomic steering wheel. The connection of memories between a chestnut, a cello and an early morning at a water pump creates three works of art. The epistemology of this study is based on a dialogue between voices from different times and traditions. Some voices are normative examples, drawn from a dialogue between Swedish inventors. The others are those of philosophers from the Age of Enlightenment, fetched from their original writings. Through that dialogue, perspectives and ideas of inventors and classical philosophers meet and are compared. A deeper understanding thus emerges that shows the essence of invention and in fact the essence of all creative work: i) Freedom – in thought and in action ii) Dialogue - to test and try new ideas and things in the ever changing circumstances. iii) Doubt - not taking established fact and assumptions for granted iv) Action – testing and breaking established praxis and rules. The study also illustrates the need for an alternative scientific form and expression concerning studies in the fields of invention, innovation and other practical work. Invention can not be captured or shaped by exact measurements, concepts, definitions or abstract models. It takes place in the borderland between fact and fiction, where technique, aesthetics and philosophy are one <b>working</b> <b>entity.</b> The strive for knowledge is endless and without limits and it is nurtured by wondering, searching and ambiguity. With inspiration from the dialogue seminar method used within KTH Advanced Programme in Reflective Practice – this study point out the actuality and vitality in using the classical philosophical writings, dialogue and analogical thinking as a scientific method within higher education.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written from the {{viewpoint}} of a working British artist. Providing a new context within which to assess the representation of time in Tacita Dean's films, the thesis groups together works located in the rural landscapes of Britain, which are evaluated for their ability to convey rural Britain with a dynamic and complex present-time temporality as living and <b>working</b> <b>entities</b> containing actual places. Influence from the culturally constructed, countryside ideal, is revealed, including Romanticism's historical agency in the countryside ideal's formation, as well as Romanticism's current, somewhat hidden influence. The selected works are observed to lack a dominant present-time frame of reference. Linking temporal representation to place, Dean's written statements regarding place are then compared to place representation in her films. Extending Jorg Heiser 's discussion on Dean as Romantic Conceptualist, the selected works are demonstrated to be largely situated within Romantic Conceptualism, shown to make a contribution to the affirmation that actual rural places exist, by attempting to convey each place's unique temporality. Unlike her writing on place, Dean's film work is demonstrated to not only contain the more rebellious forms of Romanticism associated with Romantic Conceptualism, but also more conservative forms. Instead of offering new insight, her filmic approach is found to sometimes confirm nostalgic Romantic misconceptions of a somewhat generic, primarily past-time experience in the rural British landscape. For some films this is shown to situate her somewhat outside the bounds of Romantic Conceptualism. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The characteristics suggest situations in which this variant is the most desirable measure to employ.
