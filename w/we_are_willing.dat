25|$|When {{a law of}} Torah {{conflicts}} with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} finding a way to address the problem. As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old. At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E
500|$|We {{choose to}} go to the Moon. We {{choose to go}} to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to {{organize}} and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win ...|$|E
60|$|The Emir {{listened to}} all but said little. At length, however, he asked whether <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to become Moslems, since if so he thought that we might go free. We {{answered}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not <b>willing.</b>|$|R

If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive us if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E

2500|$|We cannot {{conceive}} of God sanctioning undeserved suffering… When {{a law of}} Torah conflicts with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} find a way to address the problem… <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes when needed on moral grounds. It is our desire to strengthen Torah that forces us to recognize, explicitly the overriding importance of morality, a morality which we learn from the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> on {{the crest}} of a wave and nobody, {{literally}} nobody on the Hill or anywhere else ever questioned our ability to do anything if we wanted to do it [...] if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to spend the money and [...] the effort to do it.|$|R
2500|$|Good {{had shown}} that, for some {{configurations}} of background knowledge, Nicod's criterion is false (provided that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to equate [...] "inductively support" [...] with [...] "increase the probability of" [...] – see below). The possibility remained that, {{with respect to}} our actual configuration of knowledge, which {{is very different from}} Good's example, Nicod's criterion might still be true and so we could still reach the paradoxical conclusion. Hempel, on the other hand, insists that it is our background knowledge itself which is the red herring, and that we should consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance.|$|E

I therefore make this proposal: <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive....

2500|$|Myers further {{stated that}} [...] "several {{faculty members and}} deans {{suggested}} that perhaps {{it was time to}} stop playing ranking roulette and opt out of the survey."

60|$|That {{night we}} turned in without {{standing}} watch, and next morning came a light, drizzling rain which {{forced us to}} keep under cover unless <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> to toddle around on the wet decks, which was not particularly cheerful amusement.|$|R

Jacobs {{told the}} Black Panthers {{there would be}} 25,000 protesters in Chicago for the event, {{but no more than}} 200 showed up on the evening of Wednesday, October 8, 1969, in Chicago's Lincoln Park, and perhaps half of them were members of Weatherman collectives from around the country. The crowd milled about for several hours, cold and uncertain. Late in the evening, Jacobs stood on the {{pedestal}} of the bombed Haymarket policemen's statue and declared: [...] "We'll probably lose people today... We don't really have to win here ... just the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to fight the police is a political victory."
