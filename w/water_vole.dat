5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola amphibius). There may also be populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, tench, rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank in other places. The <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> surveys have followed the best practice described in the <b>Water</b> <b>Vole</b> Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> {{are fully}} {{protected}} under Section 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). This legal protection means that due {{care must be}} paid to the presence of <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> are {{currently}} being reintroduced as a threatened species in Yorkshire, England.

40|$|The {{population}} of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> Arvicola amphibius was surveyed on 21 {{islands in the}} Solvær archipelago, northern Norway, in August 2012; 11 islands with semi-wild domestic sheep Ovis aries and 10 islands without sheep. Signs from <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> are very easy to detect and were used {{as a measure of}} the population (on a scale 0 - 10), and the numbers of sheep were counted. The ranking of signs on islands with and without sheep was compared, and a significant difference was found. Islands with sheep had, with one exception, only very small and fragmented populations of <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> the one exception being a fairly large Carex swamp that was not grazed by the sheep and where a moderate-sized {{population of}} voles was found. Islands without sheep had much larger populations of <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> giving a ranking about four times higher. One reason for the devastating effect of sheep on <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> is probably the fact that the sheep are living year-round on these islands with no supplemental food...|$|R
5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and <b>water</b> <b>vole,</b> wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European <b>water</b> <b>vole.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Itchen Navigation {{supports}} a rich flora and fauna, and one {{benefit of the}} 5-year grant-funded restoration project has been the regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document this. Annual reports on the populations of birds, bats, otters, water voles and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies have been produced, with occasional reports on other aspects, while the Environment Agency has produces fisheries reports. As part of the project, a number of engineering works {{have been carried out}} to stabilise the banks, and trees have been cut back {{to reduce the amount of}} shade and encourage the growth of marginal vegetation. In the case of the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> survey, this has been concentrated on the sections where work has been carried out, whereas the butterfly, damselfly and dragonfly survey has tended to cover the whole navigation. Vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along the banks. The project has tried to avoid the installation of revetments, as the vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing the banks, but where a revetment is necessary to combat erosion, it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften the edge.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{contains}} {{a variety of}} mammals due to its geographical and climatic diversity. For many of the mammals, Israel is the border of their territory. The territories of species which originate in the Palearctic generally stop at the deserts and those who originate from the African deserts usually stop at the Mediterranean coasts. Most of the mammals in Israel are of a Palearctic origin and about {{a tenth of the}} mammals are endemic to its general area. The Land of Israel once contained a variety of mammals, however in recent times many mammals such as the European <b>water</b> <b>vole,</b> the cheetah and the Caucasian squirrel went locally extinct.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} {{of water and}} unimproved grassland and patches of semi-natural woodland, particularly around Greenfields Nature Reserve, has created a habitat that includes Cuckoo flower and <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> {{as well as many}} butterfly species.

40|$|International audienceSpatial {{segregation}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} mechanisms allowing the co-existence of similar interacting species in heterogeneous environments. Analysing spatial segregation requires information on individual home-range sizes and their degree of spatial overlap. In this study, we used radio-tracking to report {{for the first time the}} home-range and core-area sizes of sympatric Cabrera and <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> and to analyse intra- and inter-specific space sharing within habitat patches in a highly fragmented landscape. Results indicated that both species exhibited strong fine-scale site fidelity and reduced variation in range size across sexes and seasons. Monogamous mating system seemed to prevail for both species, although <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> may also exhibit polygynous breeding strategies. Mean home-range and core-area sizes of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> (946. 3 and 156. 6  m) were about twice that of Cabrera voles (418. 2 and 55. 1  m). Within habitat patches, individuals of both species often overlapped their home ranges, particularly during the dry season (May–September), though intra-specific home-range overlap was generally higher than inter-specific overlap. Inter-specific space sharing was restricted to areas outside the centre of activity of animals, as no core-area overlap was ever recorded between Cabrera and <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b> Taken together, results support the view that co-existence of Cabrera and <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> in Mediterranean patchy habitats may in part result from spatial segregation among individuals, which may reflect competitive displacement or small-scale habitat partitioning. Results highlight the need to account for species interactions when designing conservation management strategies for sympatric Cabrera and <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> in fragmented landscapes...|$|R

25|$|The diet is {{generally}} more diverse {{than any other}} co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making {{up the majority of}} the diet. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order of extent of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the common vole (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe; the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle-owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and hares and rabbits.|$|E

Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron (Ardea cinerea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl.

40|$|International audienceWe {{document}} the kinetics of bromadiolone in two rodent populations after a field control of <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> and their implications for predator exposure. <b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> and common voles were trapped aboveground and underground from 1 to 135 days after bromadiolone {{treatment in the}} field. Livers, digestive tracts, and rests of the body were analyzed separately. Our results indicate that 99. 6 % of the <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> trapped underground and 41 % of the common voles trapped aboveground contain bromadiolone residues. Concentrations were maximal between 3. 3 and 6. 5 days after treatment, according to the tissues examined and the model applied for <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> and after 1. 3 to 3. 7 days for common <b>voles.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>voles</b> appeared available almost exclusively for foraging predators. Common voles, found {{less likely to be}} poisoned and exhibiting weaker concentrations, were mainly sampled aboveground. The liver, primarily eaten by some predators and scavengers, contains a larger bromadiolone quantity (59 % of the total amount found in <b>water</b> <b>voles).</b> The rejection of the digestive tract by those species may lead to a subsequent consumption of voles with higher bromadiolone concentrations (from + 3. 8 to + 5. 8 % of concentration) and provide a moderate risk increase. After 135 days, eight of the ten <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> and one of the two common voles exhibited detectable residues. Additionally, one specimen presented higher concentrations than the others, and similar to those measured in Voles trapped between the first 15 - 20 days. This may have consequences on predator intoxications several months after treatment. These results integrate individual differences for the two main rodent species present in treated areas. Implications for predator exposure were investigated {{at the end of the}} study and suggest that, if the risk of secondary poisoning is maximal during the first 15 - 20 days when the rodent densities remain high, exposure conditions are maintained for at least 135 days...|$|R
