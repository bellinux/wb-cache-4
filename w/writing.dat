5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began <b>writing</b> commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began <b>writing</b> for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her <b>writing</b> improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for <b>writing</b> the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience <b>writing</b> radio plays.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's <b>writing</b> {{was shaped}} by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice <b>writing</b> concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his <b>writing.</b> One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his <b>writing.</b> He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphic <b>writing</b> {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day <b>writing,</b> scribes used a cursive form of <b>writing,</b> called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of <b>writing,</b> Demotic, became the prevalent <b>writing</b> style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about the {{influence}} – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's <b>writing.</b> Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, who wrote a lengthy piece {{on the death of}} his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote anything in response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was <b>writing</b> primarily comedies, and that <b>writing</b> continued until a few years after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
