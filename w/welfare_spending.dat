40|$|Using {{microdata}} {{from the}} Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), {{this study examines}} the role of inheritance, income and welfare state policies in explaining differences in household net wealth within and between euro area countries. First, about {{one third of the}} households in the 13 European countries we study report having received an inheritance, and these households have considerably higher net wealth than those which did not inherit. Second, regression analyses on households' relative wealth position show that, on average, having received an inheritance lifts a household by about 14 net wealth percentiles. At the same time, each additional percentile in the income distribution is associated with about 0. 4 net wealth percentiles. These results are consistent across countries. Third, multilevel cross-country regressions show that the degree of <b>welfare</b> state <b>spending</b> across countries is negatively correlated with household net wealth. These findings suggest that social services provided by the state are substitutes for private wealth accumulation and partly explain observed differences in levels of household net wealth across European countries. In particular, the effect of substitution relative to net wealth decreases with growing wealth levels. This implies that an increase in <b>welfare</b> state <b>spending</b> goes along with an increase - rather than a decrease - of observed wealth inequality...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} economists have {{dismissed}} the popular {{belief that the}} debt crisis was caused by excessive social <b>welfare</b> <b>spending.</b> According to their analysis, increased debt levels were mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the late-2000s financial crisis, and the global economic slowdown thereafter. The average fiscal deficit in the euro area in 2007 was only 0.6% before it grew to 7% during the financial crisis. In the same period, the average government debt rose from 66% to 84% of GDP. The authors also stressed that fiscal deficits in the euro area were stable or even shrinking since the early 1990s. US economist Paul Krugman named Greece as the only country where fiscal irresponsibility {{is at the heart}} of the crisis. British economic historian Robert Skidelsky added that it was indeed excessive lending by banks, not deficit spending that created this crisis. Government's mounting debts are a response to the economic downturn as spending rises and tax revenues fall, not its cause.|$|E
