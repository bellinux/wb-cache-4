Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called the Settlers <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of the Settlers, to bring the Settlers under the ice in Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|In {{gathering}} inspirations for Wrapped in Red, Clarkson {{started by}} listening to Bing Crosby's and Rosemary Clooney's soundtracks from the 1954 feature film White Christmas, as well as Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas (1994) and Merry Christmas to You (1997) by Reba McEntire. While Greg Kurstin, <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> play in a jazz band, took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance. Clarkson also cited that {{her relationship with her}} then-fiancé Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.|$|E

5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide in Texas.

It had just gone to war with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel.

The follow-up to the critical and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> play music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her.

5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E

5|$|The first semi-permanent {{inhabitants}} of regions near Antarctica (areas situated {{south of the}} Antarctic Convergence) were British and American sealers <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> spend {{a year or more}} on South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness, Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, <b>who</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
