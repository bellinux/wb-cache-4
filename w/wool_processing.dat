5|$|During the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a large <b>wool</b> <b>processing</b> factory was established in Winchester, England in about 50 AD. By 1000 AD, England and Spain were recognized as the twin centers of sheep production in the Western world. As the original breeders of the fine-wooled merino sheep that have historically dominated the wool trade, the Spanish gained great wealth. Wool money largely financed Spanish rulers and thus the voyages to the New World by conquistadors. The powerful Mesta (its full title was Honrado Concejo de la Mesta, the Honorable Council of the Mesta) was a corporation of sheep owners mostly drawn from Spain's wealthy merchants, Catholic clergy and nobility that controlled the merino flocks. By the 17th century, the Mesta held upwards of two million head of merino sheep.|$|E
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for <b>wool</b> <b>processing</b> factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|E

40|$|This paper applies an {{assemblage}} {{reading to}} the contemporary global woollen industry, in order to draw out and examine the more-than-human dimensions of globalization, which link sheep grazing on the hills of mid Wales to the Chinese textile industry, and beyond. Specifically, we trace the interactions and interdependencies between human and non-human, organic and inorganic, technical and natural components of the global wool assemblage through various stages of <b>wool</b> production, <b>processing,</b> distribution, marketing, and consumption, end-use and re-use. In so doing, we consider the agency of non-human actors within the assemblage including climate, pathogenic organisms, sheep and wool itself, {{as well as the}} discursive, technological and regulatory regimes that seek to control, commodify and assign different forms of value to these unruly elements. Through the example of wool, we develop a broader argument for more-than-human globalization in understanding how rural societies are negotiating change in the context of neoliberalism.

2500|$|Alpaca fiber {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to sheep wool fiber. [...] Its softness comes from having a different smoother scale surface than sheep wool. American breeders have enhanced the softness by selecting for finer fiber diameter fiber, similar to merino wool. Fiber diameter is a highly inherited trait in both alpaca and sheep. The difference in the individual fiber scales compared to sheep wool also creates the glossy shine which is prized in alpaca. Alpaca fibers have a higher tensile strength than <b>wool</b> fibers. In <b>processing,</b> slivers lack fiber cohesion and single alpaca rovings lack strength. Blend these together and the durability is increased several times over. More twisting is necessary, especially in Suri, and this can reduce a yarn's softness.|$|R
