5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a black metal {{influence}} in the album's imagery.

5|$|Physically {{abused as}} a child, Judd {{wants to keep}} Shiloh {{because he does not}} {{comprehend}} <b>why</b> <b>people</b> are so interested in rescuing the abused dog. No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E

5|$|According to statistics, the South Okanagan {{region is}} underserved {{in terms of}} airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport {{provides}} international flights to 62commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475people, totaling 25percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport {{was considered to be}} the area's primary airport, hence <b>why</b> <b>people</b> questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway {{was in the process of}} expansion.|$|E
5|$|As aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes Alcazar's {{decision}} to go to war with neighbouring Nuevo Rico over the oil-rich Gran Chapo, and is framed as a traitor by the international oil and weapon companies. He escapes imprisonment with the aid of the mercenary Pablo; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas, in the hope that they can explain to him <b>why</b> <b>people</b> wish to steal the fetish. From a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding <b>why</b> <b>people,</b> especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

5|$|The third protagonist is Gerald, {{a member}} of the Black Army of Sullivan. Also very loyal, Gerald {{nevertheless}} wonders <b>why</b> <b>people</b> do not unite to face the common threat represented by the Otellos. Commander Sullivan was another companion of professor Alvin and Guinevere, and also became a Warhead. His divergence of opinions with the White Army forced him to gather his own distinct army. The fourth and final protagonist is Haze Healy, {{a member of}} the Keepers; a faction opposed to both White and Black Armies.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain <b>why</b> <b>people</b> would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining <b>why</b> <b>people</b> are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E

5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain <b>why</b> <b>people</b> with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or <b>why</b> <b>people</b> were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took {{a central role in}} personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons <b>why</b> <b>people</b> tend to feel less worthy and <b>why</b> <b>people</b> become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E
