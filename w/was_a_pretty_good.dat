500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, and he sat on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948. [...] "But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{critic for}} The Star-Ledger, said the episode was satisfying, although {{he felt it}} was short on laughs, except for Jim's antics with the tuxedo and the episode's documentary-style interviews. Sepinwall particularly praised the twist of Michael quitting and said he looked forward to seeing where the subplot went. Jeff Labrecque said [...] "watching Jim flail for approval [...] one of the episode's most awkward delights", but he said the episode was really about [...] "the type of man Michael Scott really is". Labrecque also said he looked forward to seeing how Michael regained his job, and raised the suggestion that the reason Michael clashed so much with Charles was because he was intimidated by the man's race. Brian Howard of The Journal News said, [...] "For 22 minutes of not much fun and only some funny, 'New Boss' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> episode." [...] He particularly liked the ending, which {{he said he did not}} see coming and served as a kind of redemption for Michael; Howard also liked Pam's documentary interviews and Jim's failed efforts to make a good impression to Charles. Several reviewers particularly praised the line about the [...] "two-way petting zoo", a zoo in which people pet the animals and the animals pet back.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting {{the shit out of}} Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but it works well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E

500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> episode back in 1997. It’s {{not a very good}} episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I think it does a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

I mean, {{there was a little bit}} of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling – you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that [...] It remains to be seen at this point what happens.
