50|$|New {{properties}} {{appear in}} magnetic materials as dimensions {{are reduced to}} a typical magnetic length scale, like domain <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> or exchange correlation length, that lie in the nanometer range.

30|$|The {{collective}} {{dynamics of}} magnetic domain wall under electric current is {{studied in the}} form of spin transfer torque (STT). The out-of-plane STT induced effective force is obtained based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation including microscopic STT terms. The relation between microscopic calculations and collective description of the domain wall motion is established. With our numerical calculations based on tight binding free electron model, we find that the non adiabatic out-of-plane torque components have considerable non-local properties. It turns out that the calculated effective forces decay significantly with increasing domain <b>wall</b> <b>widths.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Germanic limes, {{built of}} wood palisades, Hadrian's Wall was {{primarily}} a stone construction. The western third of the wall, from modern-day Carlisle, Cumbria to the River Irthing, was originally built of turf for unknown reasons. Possibly to hasten its construction, the <b>wall's</b> <b>width</b> was narrowed in some sections from the original planned 12 ft to 7 ft [...] The turf wall was later rebuilt in stone, and a large ditch with adjoining mounds, known today as the Vallum, was dug {{to the south of}} the wall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{works for}} the bridge at either river bank were of brick, masonry and {{concrete}} on 13 in square pitch pine piles. The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with cutting shoes sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical roller paths and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy cast pivot, with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower roller path. Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three cylinder hydraulic engines located in the cabin. Accumulators and steam engines were duplicated. The locking mechanism for the bridge was also hydraulically powered. As a consequence of the realignment of track resulting from the resiting of the bridge the station at Selby was also partially reconstructed.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a general treatment of magnetic dissipation due to domain <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> oscillation via magnetostriction in magnetic samples. The domain <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> is modeled as a harmonic oscillator. The parameters governing this oscillator (effective mass, stiffness, damping coefficient and driving force) are derived and {{expressed in terms}} of intrinsic magnetic parameters of magnetic materials. The magnetostriction induced damping of <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> oscillations is frictional in nature. An external ac magnetic field serves as a driving force of the oscillator. It is found that the response to the driving force depends very much on the micromagnetic structures of the magnetic domain wall. Different micromagnetic structures lead to different magnetic dissipation for a given external field. Besides giving a quantitative microscopic explanation to magnetic dissipation data measured by magnetic dissipation force microscopy, this theory predicts two new phenomena: one {{is that there is a}} minimum driving force for the <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> to oscillate and the other is a new resonance phenomenon, domain <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> resonance...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{wished to}} {{determine}} whether treatment of vertebral osteoporosis with human parathyroid peptide 1 - 34 (hPTH 1 - 34), given as a daily injection with supplementary treatment with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), increases cancellous bone area in the ilium by increasing the size of packets of new bone. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: The width of packets of cancellous bone (<b>wall</b> <b>width)</b> was measured at random intercepts and mean values calculated. Cancellous bone area and perimeter were also measured. Indices of trabecular separation and the complementary quantity trabecular number were derived according to Parfitt's method, as well as trabecular width. Patients were used as their own controls and changes in these indices calculated. Correlations were calculated for data obtained from independent measurements. PATIENTS: We studied eleven women with post-menopausal osteoporosis, diagnosed by fractures after exclusion of causes of secondary osteoporosis. RESULTS: One woman did not comply with her HRT therapy. In the others, treatment with hPTH 1 - 34 + HRT restored the characteristically depressed pre-treatment values of <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> to normal. Trabecular width increased approximately four times more than <b>wall</b> <b>width.</b> Changes in <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> correlated with changes in cancellous bone area; however, bone area increased considerably more than could be accounted for statistically by changes in <b>wall</b> <b>width.</b> A decrease in trabecular separation was found {{to account for the}} additional increase in bone area (P = 0. 056). CONCLUSION: hPTH 1 - 34 + oestrogen and progestagen therapy increases the width of packets of new cancellous bone with consequent increases in the width of trabecular plates...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{arguments}} exists that the "minimal" BPS <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> in large N supersymmetric gluodynamics vanishes as 1 /N. There {{is a certain}} tension between this assertion {{and the fact that}} the mesons coupled to the gluino condensate have masses which do not scale with N. To reconcile these facts we argue that there should exist additional soliton-like states with masses scaling as N. The BPS walls must be "made" predominantly of these heavy states which are coupled to the gluino condensate stronger than the conventional mesons. The tension of the BPS wall junction scales as N^ 2, which serves as an additional argument in favor of the 1 /N scaling of the <b>wall</b> <b>width.</b> The heavy states can be thought of as solitons of the corresponding closed string theory. They are related to certain fivebranes in the M-theory construction. We study the issue of the <b>wall</b> <b>width</b> in toy models which capture some features of supersymmetric gluodynamics.
