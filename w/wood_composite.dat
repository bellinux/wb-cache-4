5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent Knees. These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide knees. Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E
25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} plate joiner) is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E

50|$|Gladman et al. {{found that}} as θ {{approaches}} 0°, the curvature approximates the classical Timoshenko equation and performs similarly to a bimetallic strip. But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> materials that change shape based on their printed grain direction and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the grain direction. The second method uses both the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than <b>wood</b> <b>composite</b> construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|E

In addition, this method allows the production of larger sized products at lower pressure [6, 7].

40|$|For many wood cutting processes, the {{interest}} of high-speed tool steels and tungsten carbides remains very important because of their good tool edge accuracy and easy grinding. The wear of high-speed steel and tungsten carbide is an important economic parameter. Wood extractives and silica have a potential adverse effect on tool wear. Rapid chemical wearing due to corrosion and mechanical wearing {{has been attributed to}} the presence of extractives and silica in <b>wood</b> and <b>wood</b> <b>composites.</b> This paper presents the wear characteristics of SKH 51 high-speed steel and K 10 tungsten carbide caused by extractive and abrasive materials present in the lesser-known Tapi-Tapi <b>wood</b> and <b>wood</b> <b>composites</b> of <b>wood</b> cement board, particleboard, MDF, and oriented strand board (OSB).

40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] toughness of <b>wood</b> and <b>wood</b> <b>composites</b> has traditionally been characterized by a stress intensity factor, an initiation strain energy release rate (G[subscript init]) or a total energy to fracture (G[subscript f]). These parameters provide incomplete fracture characterization for these materials because the toughness changes as the crack propagates. Thus for materials such as wood, oriented strand board (OSB), plywood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), it is essential to characterize the fracture properties during crack propagation by measuring a full crack resistant or R curve. This study used energy methods during crack propagation to measure full R curves and then compared the fracture properties of wood and various wood-based composites such as, OSB, LVL and plywood. The effect of exposure to elevated temperature on fracture properties of these materials was also studied. The steady state energy release rate (G[subscript SS]) of wood was lower than that of <b>wood</b> <b>composites</b> such as LVL, plywood and OSB. The resin in <b>wood</b> <b>composites</b> provides them with a higher fracture toughness compared to solid lumber. Depending upon the internal structure of the material the mode of failure also varied. With exposure to elevated temperatures, G[subscript SS] for all materials decreased while the failure mode remained the same. The scatter associated with conventional bond strength tests, such as internal bond (IB) and bond classification tests, renders any statistical comparison using those tests difficult. In contrast, fracture tests with R curve analysis may provide an improved tool for characterization of bond quality in <b>wood</b> <b>composites...</b>|$|R
