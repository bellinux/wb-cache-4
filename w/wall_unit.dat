The name was the winning entry in an employee contest. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($ to $ in [...] dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952.

50|$|Modularity {{enters the}} modern artistic {{repertory}} largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect Louis Herman De Koninck led {{a team of}} countrymen in creating {{one of the first}} modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer Gilbert Rohde crafted several lines of modular casework for the Herman Miller Corporation in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the EAS Storage Unit series by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> system that remains in production today.|$|E

The new school contained a dedicated auditorium, and a state of the art pool with diving area and full glass window panels which would open to an enclosed outside area. The [...] "T" [...] shaped pool also contained an observation window in the deep/diving end accessed through one of the many underground tunnels. The pool area contains spectator seating/bleachers. The school also was designed with a gym which could be divided into three sections using folding walls to accommodate individual classes. The gym when completely opened, often hosted the school's home basketball and other spectator sporting events. The two [...] "outer" [...] gym areas were used to accommodate wooden pull-out bleachers which when not in use, were rolled into a <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> on the north and south ends of the gym.|$|E

5000|$|Inmates {{scheduled}} for execution are brought from death row to the <b>Walls</b> <b>Unit</b> {{early in the}} afternoon of their scheduled execution. Unlike other states, Texas prohibits inmates from special meals (since 2011), because of abuse of the privilege by past prisoners and the rationale {{that they did not}} offer a meal to their victims and therefore should not be allowed a special recognition. Inmates can, but are not required to, make a last statement prior to their execution. By law executions are scheduled to begin after 6:00 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time.

50|$|The Tower crown {{representing}} the bent of a striped ribbon façade {{consists of two}} big 41m span twisted steel arches with interim steel supports cantilevered from the central cylindrical RC core walls and 4 smaller arches-props supporting the white steel ribbons-stripes (tubular frames filled with perforated steel sheets). The twisted steel arches were designed and manufactured in Piedmont, Italy , and then delivered to Moscow in pieces by trucks and then finally assembled on the roof (bolted from inside). The parapet glazing surrounding roof open observation deck on Level 52 is made of cold bent (tempered triplex) glass with motorized foldable top elements for easy access of the BMU cradle over the parapet. The bespoke BMU system with three articulated arms crane and 300kg auxiliary hoist follows the complex twisting form of the façade in order to guarantee the proper access for maintenance and cleaning of the curtain wall. The special cradle {{has been designed to}} reach all the positions along the façade without physical impact on the curtain wall with support of safety straps, push locks and sockets incorporated in each curtain <b>wall</b> <b>unit,</b> special sticks and soft rubber rollers preventing any scratches or other damage from cradle contacts with fragile envelope of glass, pressure caps and soft aluminum cladding.|$|E

The frequency of using diaphragm wall construction method among many deep excavation construction methods in Taiwan is the highest in the world. The traditional view of managing diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities is to establish each phase of the sequencing of construction activities by heuristics. However, it conflicts final phase of engineering construction with unit construction and effects planning construction time. In order to avoid this kind of situation, we use management of science in the study of diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> construction to formulate multi-objective combinational optimization problem. Because the characteristic (belong to NP-Complete problem) of problem mathematic model is multi-objective and combining explosive, it is advised that using the 2 -type Self-Learning Neural Network (SLNN) to solve the N= 12, 24, 36 of diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities program problem. In order to compare the liability of the results, this study will use random researching method in comparison with the SLNN.
