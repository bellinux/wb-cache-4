In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference {{that it was time}} for them to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved.

But fuck, I guess we're {{going to be talking about}} this for awhile". [...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in".

We describe the functionality of WebMaster and show that {{it can be used to}} validate the meta-data of the BUISY system. Furthermore, WebMaster is used to create an aggreated metadata model of the whole system. Unlike traditional meta-data which is typically attached to the individual pages of the information system, such a single aggregated meta-data model provides a comprehensive overview over the system and can serve as a basis for further analyses. We show how such an aggregated meta-data model can provide the basis for an intelligent interface of an information source that can be used for implementing advanced access feature like content-based navigation and query answering...|$|R
