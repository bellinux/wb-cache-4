6000|$|... "What!" [...] it will {{perhaps be}} replied, [...] "have, then, ships never <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> {{perfectly}} yet, {{even by the}} men who have devoted most attention to them?" [...] Assuredly not. A ship never yet has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> at all, in any other sense than men have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in [...] "Landscapes with figures." [...] Things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of ships, just as things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of shepherds or banditti; but the best average ship-painting no more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in one of Van der Meulen's battle-pieces express the higher truths of humanity.|$|R
5|$|All British {{patterns}} were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most {{of the model}} designs <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> by women from London's Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.|$|E
5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{predominantly}} military character, {{the castle}} {{is one of}} the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.|$|E

5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private ownership.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, anecdotal sources {{attribute}} {{the naming of}} the bombs to a pumpkin color: While the bombs <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> olive drab or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to Tinian were shipped in the same yellow zinc chromate primer color worn by Fat Man.|$|E
5|$|Once the Navy took over, {{the camp}} {{became known as}} HMS Royal Arthur and was used to train sailors for the war effort. In order to operate as a {{military}} base, many of the bright external colours <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> over, the dance hall became an armoury, and the rose beds were dug up, to become sites for air raid shelters.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Ships were {{sometimes}} camouflaged in classical times. Mediterranean pirate ships {{were sometimes}} painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout ships <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. Ships were sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
