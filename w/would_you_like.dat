He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to do law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E

500|$|Accounting ethics {{has been}} deemed {{difficult}} to control as accountants and auditors must consider {{the interest of the}} public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing. They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client [...] "what does two plus two equal?" [...] the accountant would be likely to respond [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it to be?". This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the first}} episode in which Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon filmed scenes {{together}} and met on-screen. Rheon {{said that he had}} always wanted to film scenes with Jon Snow: [...] "Anyone who has asked me, 'Who <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Ramsay to meet?' My answer has always been, 'Jon Snow.' He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're both here facing each other. They couldn't be any more different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're not doing it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Cy Grant, a Guyanese actor {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Lieutenant Green (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main computer operator and public announcer), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical calypsos on the current affairs programme Tonight. His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to meet him as well?'

500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, how <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{members of}} the Enterprise crew include James Doohan as chief {{engineer}} Montgomery Scott, Walter Koenig as navigator Pavel Chekov, and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, the communications officer. Uhura was supposed to give a dramatic speech in Klingon during the film, but midway through production the element was scrapped and a scene where Uhura is speaking garbled Klingon, surrounded by books, was added for extra humour. Nichols protested the scene, wondering why there were still books in the 23rd century, but accepted the change since {{it would be the}} last Star Trek film she would appear in. Nichols was more uncomfortable with some of the dialogue's racial undertones. Her character was originally to speak the line, [...] "Guess who's coming to dinner," [...] as the Klingons arrive on the Enterprise, but refused to say the part and it was given to Koenig's character instead. Nichols also refused to say the line [...] "yes, but <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> your daughter to marry one [...] ", and it was dropped from the film altogether. George Takei also returned as former helmsman Hikaru Sulu, though his character is now commander of the USS Excelsior, which includes former Enterprise yeoman Janice Rand (again played by Grace Lee Whitney) as a communications officer.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... I had never met him. I rang him up and said, 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> to play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, {{and for the first}} time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E

500|$|Bruce Campbell, {{a long-time}} {{colleague}} of director Sam Raimi, has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey kid, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, has a bit part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented it from happening. The novelization of Spider-Man identifies Liz Allan as the character portrayed by Sally Livingstone.|$|E
