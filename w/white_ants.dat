500|$|It is {{not known}} when an actual live hedge was first grown along the customs line but {{it is likely that}} it began in the 1840s when thorn bushes, cut and laid along the line as a barrier (known as the [...] "dry hedge", see also dead hedge), took root. [...] By 1868 it had become [...] of [...] "thoroughly impenetrable" [...] hedge. [...] The {{original}} dry hedge consisted mainly of samples of the dwarf Indian Plum fixed to the line with stakes. [...] This hedge was at risk of attack by <b>white</b> <b>ants,</b> rats, fire, storms, locusts, parasitic creepers, natural decay and strong winds which could destroy furlongs at a time and necessitated constant maintenance. Allan Octavian Hume, Commissioner of Inland Customs from 1867–70, estimated that each mile of dry hedge required 250 tons of material to construct and that this material had to be carried to the line from between [...] away. [...] The amount of labour involved in such a task {{was one of the reasons}} that a live hedge was encouraged, particularly as damage required the replacement of around half of the dry hedge each year.|$|E
