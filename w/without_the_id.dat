40|$|Because of {{the risk}} of {{introduction}} of yellow fever to South-East Asia, comparative studies were made of yellow fever vaccination in Malayans who had a high prevalence of antibody to related viruses and in volunteers without related antibody. The proportions of positive neutralizing antibody responses to subcutaneous vaccination with 17 D vaccine were not significantly different between volunteers with and without heterologous antibody but the degree of antibody response was greater in those <b>without.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ID</b> 50 of 17 D in both groups was about 5 mouse intracerebral LD 50. Multiple puncture vaccination with 17 D gave a much lower response rate than subcutaneous vaccination in volunteers with heterologous antibody. In both groups subcutaneous doses of about 50 mouse intracerebral LD 50 gave larger antibody responses than higher doses. The neutralizing indices and analysis of results were calculated by a method based on the survival time of the mice. This method, which has advantages over that of Reed & Muench, is fully described in an annex to this paper...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The University Hospital of Modena {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{hospitals}} in the Emilia Romagna region and each yearabout 15. 000 surgery procedures are performed. We have been working on safety surgery, for safety of patients throughoutthe control of the correct function of surgical devices and sterilization of surgical instruments. In particular we have created andapplied a project called "SOS surgery" that included all the 4 objectives of the second Global Patient Safety Challenge "SafeSurgery Save Life" that are: Clean Surgery, Safe Anesthesia, Safe Surgical Teams, and Measurement. In agreement with theW. H. O. program we have decided to use the surgical safety check list to improve communication between all members of thesurgical team. Material and Methods: In October 2008 we started a trial for the application of the surgical check list. We have involved onegeneral surgery unit and we've appropriately trained the whole surgical team involved. We have identiﬁed as check listcoordinatora circulating nurse who conﬁrms completion of each step of the check list. At the end of procedures the whole teamagree and sign the check list. Results: During a period of three months we collected 175 check lists. The analysis of the data has highlighted 30 criticalevents (17 %) represented by surgical site not market in two cases, laterality not reported on the surgical note in one, change inanaesthesiological technique not reported on the surgical note in three, an inversion in the order of the procedures as plannedin another three, patient <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>ID</b> tag in one, the antibiotic prophylaxis not reported on the surgical note in seven, theabsence of the anaesthesiological consent in one, the absence of blood risk evaluation in three, a surgical team diﬀerent fromwhich on the surgical note in six, procedure not properly indicated on the surgical note in two and lack of preoperative patientpreparation in one case. In any case the critical events reported had clinical negative consequences on patients. Conclusions: The compliance of the whole surgical team in the application of the checklist has been satisfactory and itsapplication has been useful to check and avert critical events. It's our aim to extend its use ﬁrst of all to the other generalsurgery units and then to the other surgical specialties...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if children born to mothers with ID had an increased risk of being diagnosed with mental illness, injuries, and violence compared with children of mothers <b>without</b> <b>ID.</b> <b>The</b> study comprised a population based cohort of children born in Sweden between 1999 and 2005. Data were collected from the Medical Birth Register and linked with two other national registers; ICD- 10 codes were used for medical diagnoses, including <b>ID.</b> <b>The</b> children were followed from birth to seven years of age. In total, 478, 577 children were included, of whom 2749 were born to mothers with ID. Children of mothers with ID were at a greater risk of having mental health problems (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 74 - 2. 35) and ID (OR = 4. 14; CI = 2. 95 - 5. 82) in early childhood. They had an increased risk for injuries due to falls (OR = 1. 15; CI 1. 04 - 1. 27). The largest risk related to trauma was violence and child abuse (OR = 3. 11; CI = 1. 89 - 5. 12). In conclusion, children of mothers with ID had an increased risk for injuries, violence, and child abuse. We therefore suggest that parents with ID should receive evidence based support so that their children receive the best care and protection. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|To {{log in to}} {{a mobile}} social network service (SNS) server, users must enter their ID and {{password}} {{to get through the}} authentication process. At that time, if the user sets up the automatic login option on the app, a sort of security token is created on the server based on <b>the</b> user’s <b>ID</b> and password. This security token is called a credential. Because such credentials are convenient for users, they are utilized by most mobile SNS apps. However, the current state of credential management for the majority of Android SNS apps is very weak. This paper demonstrates the possibility of a credential cloning attack. Such attacks occur when an attacker extracts the credential from the victim’s smart device and inserts it into their own smart device. Then, <b>without</b> knowing <b>the</b> victim’s <b>ID</b> and password, <b>the</b> attacker can access the victim’s account. This type of attack gives access to various pieces of personal information without authorization. Thus, in this paper, we analyze the vulnerabilities of the main Android-based SNS apps to credential cloning attacks, and examine the potential leakage of personal information that may result.

40|$|Developing reading {{literacy}} in students with mild intellectual disabilities (<b>ID)</b> in <b>the</b> adapted programmes with lower educational standards is extremely challenging. While there are {{similarities and differences}} between {{reading literacy}} in students with and <b>without</b> <b>ID,</b> <b>the</b> gap between the two groups increases with age. Listening (language) comprehension of many students with ID often exceeds reading comprehension; usually even older students fail to achieve the same level of listening and reading comprehension. The explanation of reading difficulties of students with ID includes two basic paradigms. The first one relates to the overall slow cognitive development reflected in the literacy development as well. The latter is slow but it follows the same sequences as in students <b>without</b> <b>ID.</b> <b>The</b> second paradigm highlights structural differences in reading literacy of students with and without ID. It emphasizes different cognitive and linguistic factors responsible for reading difficulties in older readers with ID. Our study has confirmed the two above mentioned aspects with the comparison of the reading literacy in the younger and older students with ID. For this purpose, 61 fifth graders and 70 ninth graders included in the adapted educational programmes participated in the study. Characteristics of the reading literacy of both groups of students with ID were investigated with several multivariate methods and compared afterwards. We gained insight into the reading literacy of students with <b>ID</b> in <b>the</b> two important periods of elementary education (at the end of systematic literacy teaching {{and at the end of}} primary school). We upgraded our findings by comparing the results of fifth graders with the standards applicable to <b>the</b> students <b>without</b> <b>ID</b> at <b>the</b> end of systematic literacy teaching. The results show that reading efficiency of <b>the</b> students with <b>ID</b> is based on lower level processes (decoding) much longer, while the roles of decoding and language comprehension change with age similarly to <b>the</b> students <b>without</b> <b>ID.</b> Reading difficulties of students with ID are complex and relate to different factors of reading literacy, among which we highlight phonological awareness, auditory short-term and working memory, vocabulary and linguistic reasoning. It is hard for <b>the</b> students with <b>ID</b> to compensate their reading difficulties due to their problems with transferring knowledge to the new situations and a reduced ability to independently use experiences acquired in reading lessons. The explanation of the structure and development of reading literacy of students with ID represents an important contribution to knowledge in the field of special education and it provides an empirical basis for improving the teaching approaches. Based on the research findings we give different recommendations for teaching reading to children with ID. In addition, we present solutions on how to adapt the reading tests used in our study to detect the best student’s achievements. ...|$|R
50|$|Sigmund Freud {{determined}} that the personality consists of three different elements, <b>the</b> <b>id,</b> <b>the</b> ego and <b>the</b> superego. <b>The</b> <b>id</b> is <b>the</b> aspect of personality that is driven by internal and basic drives and needs. These are typically instinctual, such as hunger, thirst, and the drive for sex, or libido. <b>The</b> <b>id</b> acts {{in accordance with the}} pleasure principle, in that it avoids pain and seeks pleasure. Due to the instinctual quality of <b>the</b> <b>id,</b> it is impulsive and often unaware of implications of actions. The ego is driven by reality principle. The ego works to balance both <b>the</b> <b>id</b> and superego. To balance these, it works to achieve <b>the</b> <b>id's</b> drive in <b>the</b> most realistic ways. It seeks to rationalize <b>the</b> <b>id's</b> instinct and please the drives that benefit the individual in the long term. It helps separate what is real, and realistic of our drives as well as being realistic about the standards that the superego sets for the individual. The superego is driven by morality principle. It acts in connection with the morality of higher thought and action. Instead of instinctively acting like <b>the</b> <b>id,</b> <b>the</b> superego works to act in socially acceptable ways. It employs morality, judging our sense of wrong and right and using guilt to encourage socially acceptable behavior.|$|R
