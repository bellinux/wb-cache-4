The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give {{me the opportunity to}} show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately the two {{incidents}} raised {{rumors of}} a possible Blink-182 reunion. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of}} the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge learned of the crash via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight. He landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to Barker: a photo of Blink aboard a submarine in the Middle East and another of himself and his two kids. [...] "One was 'Do you remember who we were?' and the other was 'This is who I am now,' [...] " [...] DeLonge said DeLonge also commented that, no matter what happened between himself and Barker in the past, [...] "none of it matters <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> somebody getting hurt." [...] Hoppus first spoke on the matter in a blog post in November 2008, writing that he [...] "hadn't had it in him" [...] to post, adding that [...] "these past two months have been the hardest times I can remember." [...] He also revealed that he, DeLonge, and Barker had all spoken in the aftermath. Barker quashed reunion rumors in December, but noted that they had been getting along.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or {{the sound of the}} guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing {{that there will be no}} more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{issue with}} the consumer's {{relationship}} with CSR {{is that it is}} much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme [...] looked into a phenomenon that they termed the [...] "CSR-Consumer Paradox". This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. For instance, a survey by Cohn & Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies. However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does.|$|E

English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try.
