500|$|Immediately {{upon her}} arrival on the show, Chloe was {{characterized}} as a manipulative [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed pleasure in portraying a vixen, stating {{that it was her}} idea to make the character [...] "edgy and funny" [...] instead of [...] "some girl who <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> fancy clothes". Chloe is first hired as a fashion consultant at Jabot Cosmetics by Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), whom she develops an attraction for. She breaks up Cane's relationship with girlfriend, Lily Winters, (Christel Khalil) by announcing that she is pregnant with his child. Upon the birth of her daughter Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono) the truth is revealed: Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) fathered the child, not Cane. After brief marriages to Cane and then Billy, Chloe begins an unsuccessful streak of relationships with men including Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson), and most recently Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). Other storylines the character encountered included Delia facing leukemia in 2011, and later when she was killed in a hit and run accident in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{refers to}} Clacton as his second camp; however, in 1937, the {{architect}} Harold Ridley Hooper, who had drawn {{the plans for}} the camp at Skegness, created plans on behalf of Butlins ltd, for a second camp at Dovercourt, in Essex. In the winter of 1938, the camp at Dovercourt was requisitioned by the government for housing children evacuated from Germany by the Kindertransport programme. Writers and speakers discussing that programme, such as Anthony Grenville and Ela Kaczmarska, claim that the camp had been constructed by Butlin and operated as a Butlin's camp for the 1937–1938 season, Kaczmarska also suggests that it had closed in the summer of 1938 (the same time the Clacton camp opened.) recollections of the refugees suggest that by December 1938 the camp was being run by Harry Warner, whose company Butlin was on the board of. At around the same time Butlin's advertised Dovercourt as [...] "associated with Butlin's" [...] and into the early 1940s Butlin <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> rail packages with LNER to the Dovercourt camp.|$|E
500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kubrick {{had already}} written a {{detailed}} treatment, and Kubrick and Herr got together at Kubrick's home every day, {{breaking down the}} treatment into scenes. From that, Herr wrote the first draft. The filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay, {{which led to a}} dispute over the final credits. Hasford remembers, [...] "We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> one widget and Michael <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> another widget and Stanley {{was the only one who}} knew that this was going to end up being a car."

[...] After grounding his putter during address to square up the club face, the ball rolled a half turn in the wind when Jones lifted the club head to place it behind the ball. [...] Although no one else observed this movement of the ball either, again Jones called a penalty on himself, but this time Jones went on to win the tournament, the second of his four U.S. Open victories.|$|E

2500|$|The Yardbirds were {{a popular}} live {{attraction}} at music clubs. [...] Much of their reputation {{was built on}} their use of a [...] "rave up" [...] musical arrangement, an instrumental interlude that builds to a climax. Clapton credits the rave up to bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and explains: [...] "While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, we were taking three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy". [...] In was at such performances that Clapton often broke a guitar string. [...] While he <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a new one, the audience would slowly clap their hands (slow handclapping). [...] This led manager Gomelsky to nickname him [...] "Eric 'Slowhand' Clapton".|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo.

Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it could say. I had the ambition—I caught it from Orson Welles—to work like mad and be a convincing actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just over a {{year after}} his {{retirement}} (in late January 1984), El Santo was a guest on Contrapunto, a Mexican television program and, completely without warning, removed his mask just enough to expose his face, in effect bidding his fans goodbye.

Santo died {{from a heart attack}} (during a stage show he <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on)</b> on February 5, 1984, at 9:40p.m., a week after his Contrapunto TV appearance.

After his death, a statue of El Santo was erected in his home town of Tulancingo and other statues have been created since then.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the academic year, Yale held its annual [...] "tap-day" [...] custom in which juniors were selected for the school's three senior societies -- Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head. [...] By tradition, the captain of Yale's football team was tapped to join Skull and Bones. [...] However, in May 1905, Shevlin was snubbed by all three societies, resulting in a public furor. [...] After the public snubbing, Shevlin reportedly [...] "left the campus and whirled away in his automobile." [...] One newspaper speculated that Shevlin's automobile was the reason for the snub:"Can it be true that Tom Shevlin, Jr. ... missed being 'tapped' for one of the senior societies merely because he had just become the possessor of a fine, new automobile and <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> a good deal of style with it? [...] It is true that he was not 'tapped;' equally true that he whirled up to the 'tapping' place in a splendid automobile, but why should the possession of a 40-horse power horseless wagon militate against a student who desires to be 'tapped' and is entitled to the distinction? ... Evidently because he had made himself unpopular and in some way the cause of the unpopularity was the splendid touring car. [...] Other automobiles there are at Yale, but the Minnesota boy had the best machine in the bunch. [...] Envy may {{have had something to do}} with the shabby treatment handed out to young Shevlin."There were also suggestions that it was the reckless manner in which Shevlin drove his car that led to his being snubbed. [...] Shevlin had also drawn attention in 1904 when traveling to England as part of the Harvard-Yale track team; his decision to stay at a different hotel than the team reportedly [...] "cost him considerable of his rather meager popularity." [...] According to another story, Shevlin had placed a $100 bet that he would be tapped by Skull and Bones, and when word of the bet reached the group, they declined to have him.|$|E
2500|$|David Flying Hawk was {{the eldest}} son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a {{performer}} with Wild West Shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named “King Tut.” [...] “King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. [...] The real King Tut’s tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying {{quite a bit of}} news about it, therefore the name King Tut. [...] The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. [...] A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. [...] This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. [...] Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. [...] The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. [...] King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. [...] There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works. [...] While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn’t been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut’s back. [...] When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. [...] The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. [...] It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild. [...] They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on.</b> [...] That was the funniest thong I’ve ever seen happened at a rodeo. [...] We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. [...] I heard {{a few years ago that}} they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I’m sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski <b>was</b> <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
