5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 1678, {{after just}} over a month of {{preparations}} at Fort Frontenac, La Salle dispatched Captain La Motte and Father Louis Hennepin together with 15 men and supplies in a vessel of 10 tons. Their mission was to begin selecting a site {{for the construction of}} Le Griffon and to erect necessary structures for shelter, storage, and defense. Because the wind was strong from the north, they sailed close to the north shore of the lake, putting in for the nights in various bays along the way. Somewhere near present-day Toronto they were frozen in and had to chop {{their way out of the}} ice. From there they struck out across the lake toward the mouth of the Niagara River. They arrived late on December 5, but the weather was rough and they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the surf and outflow of the river at night, so they stayed a few miles off shore. On December 6, they landed safely on the east bank of the river at about where Lewiston, New York is today. They attempted to sail further upstream, but the current was too strong. Ice flowing down the river threatened to damage their little brigantine and after a cable was broken, they hauled the vessel ashore and into a small ravine for protection.|$|E

[...] In spite of his statement, the senator did <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the campaign, but McKinley (who apparently saw an opportunity to show the public that he was not Hanna's creature) was slow to ask him. [...] This was a source of great stress to Hanna, who was concerned about the campaign and his relationship with McKinley; the senator fainted in his office during the wait and may have suffered a heart attack. [...] In late May, the President announced that Hanna would run his campaign. Margaret Leech suggested that McKinley was angry at Hanna for unknown reasons, thus the President's [...] "uncharacteristic coldness". [...] Morgan, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the president was using his usual indirect pressure and the power of silence. [...] He wanted and needed Hanna, but on his own terms." ...|$|E

500|$|Romney won by some 80,000votes {{and ended}} a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic {{rule in the}} state {{executive}} spot. His win was attributed to his appeal to independent voters and to those from the increasingly influential suburbs of Detroit, who by 1962 {{were more likely to}} vote Republican than the heavily Democratic residents of the city itself. [...] Additionally, Romney had appeal to labor union members that was unusual for a Republican. [...] Democrats won all the other statewide executive offices in the election, including Democratic incumbent T. John Lesinski in the separate election for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan. Romney's success caused immediate mention of him as a presidential possibility for 1964, and President John F. Kennedy said privately in 1963 that, [...] "The one fellow I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> against is Romney." ...|$|E

500|$|Heading {{into his}} junior year, Anderson was named preseason third-team All-Atlantic 10. He {{became known as}} the entrenched {{starting}} point guard for UMass and was named team captain. He posted a team-high 21 points, 5 rebounds, and 6 assists in his debut vs. St. Francis (NY). Anderson notched a career-high 29 points on December 2, against Vermont, connecting on 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. He was the first Minuteman to accomplish the feat since Monty Mack in March 2001. Anderson also recorded the seventh-most three-pointers in a single game in school history. He said, [...] "When you see a guy hit a couple shots you might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a play to get that guy open. So it definitely helps out a lot, it makes it way easier for me." [...] Following another 20-point effort vs. Boston College and a season-best 9 rebounds, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week and Dinn Brothers UMass Athlete of the Week.|$|E
500|$|While on the {{run from}} the law, Kate goes to Miami, where under the name [...] "Monica" [...] she meets and gets engaged to a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion). Before their wedding, Kevin's mother, Suzanne, gives Kate a gold locket that had been passed down on the female side of the family at weddings. A while after the ceremony, Kate calls U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane). She does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> any more and pleads for him to stop chasing her. Mars guesses that Kate has gotten {{involved}} with a man, and tells her that if Kate can really stay put, settle down, he will stop chasing her, but that they both know it is unlikely that Kate will ever stop running. Later, Kate shows signs of relief after getting a negative pregnancy test, and decides to reveal the truth about her life to her husband. She drugs Kevin, places her mother-in-law's locket in his hands and leaves.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the election, Romney {{returned}} to Bain Capital, but the loss had a lasting effect; he told his brother, [...] "I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for something again unless I can win." [...] When his father died in 1995, Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management. He also became vice-chair of the Board of the Points of Light Foundation, which had embraced his father's National Volunteer Center. Romney felt restless as the decade neared a close; the goal of simply making more money held little attraction for him. Although no longer in a local leadership position in his church, he still taught Sunday School. During the long and controversial approval and construction process for the $30million Mormon temple in Belmont, he feared that, as a political figure who had opposed Kennedy, he would become {{a focal point for}} opposition to the structure. He thus kept to a limited, behind-the-scenes role in attempts to ease tensions between the church and local residents.|$|E

It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> right out and hug the one you love."

500|$|Ross Perot {{appeared}} on the February 20 edition of Larry King Live on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991. After a lively interview concerning political issues, King directly asked Perot if there was [...] "any scenario in which [...] would run for president." [...] Perot firmly stated {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if [...] "ordinary people" [...] signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states. He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an [...] "action man... who can get things done... takes care of his people". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on [...] The New York Times speculated that Perot's [...] "iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics" [...] would appeal to the [...] "angry frustrated electorate". But Republican consultant Karl Rove characterized Perot as an [...] "untested wild man". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 National Press Club speech, which aired on C-SPAN.|$|E
500|$|For the 1970 U.S. Senate {{election}} from Michigan, state Republicans {{were looking}} for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. [...] Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, but Republicans thought he might be vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. [...] George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race. [...] However, George {{came up with the idea}} of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. [...] Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> unless no other candidate could be found. [...] U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. [...] And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. [...] Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race.|$|E

500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, knowing you can go out there and impose your will each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. We were having a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E
