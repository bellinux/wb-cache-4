25|$|Scutum is not {{a bright}} constellation, with the {{brightest}} star, Alpha Scuti, at magnitude 3.85. But some stars are notable in the constellation. Beta Scuti is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by Delta Scuti at magnitude 4.72. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type similar to the Sun, although it is 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is now coming {{at the direction of}} the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than Sirius by that time.|$|E
25|$|God {{told the}} prophet to comfort God's people and bid Jerusalem to take heart, as the city's guilt {{had been paid}} off. A voice in the {{wilderness}} called {{to clear the way}} and make a highway for God, for every valley will be lifted up, every mountain will be made low, and God's glory will be revealed to all. A voice proclaimed that all flesh is grass, its goodness like a flower of the field, which withers and fades; but God's word will stand forever. The herald of good tidings should go to the mountain and announce to the cities of Judah that God <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a Mighty One to rule, as a shepherd that feeds the flock, gathers the lambs, carries them, and gently leads them.|$|E
500|$|In January 1959, Kelly {{joined the}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} became most associated – Miles Davis. Adderley, the alto saxophonist in the band, related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano: Davis had admired Kelly's playing as part of Gillespie's band, and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances; [...] "One night, Wynton was there when we started and Miles asked him to sit in. When Red came, Wynton was playing. Miles told Red, 'Wynton's got the gig.' Just like that." [...] Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963, appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue and Someday My Prince <b>Will</b> <b>Come,</b> <b>as</b> well as on numerous concert recordings. On 1959's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever, Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track [...] "Freddie Freeloader". Even though Kelly was Davis' regular pianist, the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind, so {{this was the only}} piece that Kelly played. Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis' quintet in the spring of 1960. Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly's playing with Davis: [...] "His harmonic colorations were very beautiful. But I think above all it was his ability to swing. John [...] used to mention that. Miles used to get off the bandstand and just look at Wynton with admiration, because he really held the group together." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1935, Anne McCormick {{wrote to}} Arthur Hays Sulzberger, [...] "I hope you won't {{expect me to}} revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff." [...] Later, she interviewed major {{political}} leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'" [...] The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune, where [...] "he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs." ...|$|E

In a statement, the conference stated that its intentions were [...] "not {{to destroy a}} great university, but rather to seek justice and constructively assist a member institution with its efforts to reform."

2500|$|Kirk was {{acclaimed}} as a first-team All-American at the {{end position}} by the New York Tribune and by noted sports writers, including Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune and Fred Hayner of the Chicago Daily News. [...] When the dean of football critics, Walter Camp, named Kirk to his second team and selected little known end Taylor of Navy to his first team, charges of Eastern bias were leveled at Camp. [...] An Illinois newspaper wrote the following about Camp's omission of Kirk:"The fact that eastern football did not demonstrate any great superiority over the other sections {{of the country is}} not going to help justify the selection of seven eastern men. [...] The failure of Kirk to win a place <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a great surprise. [...] Kirk {{is one of the best}} ends the 'Big Ten' has produced in years. [...] It was felt certain that he would be selected. [...] Most of the critics picked Kirk and Muller as the ends. [...] Camp gives Taylor of Annapolis the preference over Kirk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many theorists {{raised the}} issue that hedging and {{speculation}} were more of a spectrum than a distinct duality of goals. [...] "Academic studies (e.g. Bodnar et al, 1998) show that companies usually incorporate predictions of future price levels (i.e. a ‘view’) when executing hedges (a fact which <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise to most risk management practitioners). If hedging is really just about reducing risk, then why should our expectations of future market direction have any bearing on our hedging decisions? If we hedge 50% of our exposure, instead of 80% or 100%, because {{we feel that the}} price / rate of the underlying exposure is more likely to move in our favour, does this meet the criteria for speculation?...On one level (at the extremes), {{there is no doubt that}} hedging and speculation are very different activities. However, once you move beyond the straightforward elimination of open positions, into more nuanced transactions involving complex hedging strategies or tenuous relationships between hedges and exposures, the distinction between a hedge and a bet becomes increasingly vague." ...|$|E

The game was praised by Computer Player and Electronic Entertainment for its [...] "nightmarish graphics, high-quality audio and troubling ethical dilemmas {{add up to}} a combination of the entertaining and the profound that could prove to be the foundation of an important gaming subgenre in the future," [...] and asking [...] "a lot from you in terms of the psychological and ethical choices you'll make during game play. For those familiar with Ellison's prolific writings, the moral dilemmas <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> no surprise." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation commented on the game's surreal content and heavy concern [...] "with ethics, humanity, and inner demons", but found the gameplay too limited, and summarized it as [...] "less a game than an ethical obstacle course". According to Computer Games Strategy Plus, [...] "without appearing didactic, Ellison has the ability to hit us squarely in the face with a mirror reflecting the sorry lot that we humans have become.

2500|$|Gomez {{revealed}} the artwork {{for the single}} on June 19, 2015. On it, she is seen striking a risqué pose, on a bar stool against a bare wall. The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs her hands through her hair. Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look amazing is a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of October 1, 1968, Dohrn spoke {{at a meeting in}} Chicago to condemn Chicago's Mayor Daley's orders to attack protesters during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Then, from October 11 to 13, she and SDS held a {{national}} meeting at the University of Colorado Boulder wherein Dohrn was a speaker addressing concerns about where the movement was headed and what involvement they could expect as governmental tensions mounted and the student movement splintered into factions. On October 11, 1968, Dohrn suggested she would expand the movement to non-students and do all that was necessary to complete the job of [...] "attack, expose, destroy." [...] Dohrn continued to give speeches on behalf of SDS and Weather Underground and attend leadership conferences for both organizations. On January 29 and 30, 1969, in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the University of Washington held a Cuba teach-in where Dohrn was a speaker on campus. A month later at a press conference at the regional headquarters of SDS in Chicago, Dohrn spoke of the plans that were under way to [...] "attack" [...] college graduation ceremonies across the country, saying, [...] "Our presence will be known at the graduation ceremonies where the big people <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> speakers." [...] By that time, Dohrn was now known as a National Interim Committee member of the SDS {{and a member of the}} Weatherman group.|$|E

[...] , [...] "Although Elias is related to have been carried to heaven, he deferred, he did not escape, death. For it is said of him by the mouth of the Truth Himself, 'Elias shall come and restore all things.' He shall come to 'restore all things;' for to this end is he restored to this world, that he may both fulfill the office of preaching, and pay the debt of the flesh." [...] , [...] "The holy Church, although it now loses many through the shock of temptation, yet, {{at the end of the}} world, it receives its own double, when, having received the Gentiles to the full, all Judaea too, which shall then be, agrees to hasten to its faith. For hence it is written, [...] "Until the fullness of the Gentiles shall come, and so all Israel shall be saved." [...] Hence, in the Gospel the Truth says, [...] "Elias shall come and shall restore all things." [...] For now the Church has lost the Israelites, whom it could not convert by preaching; but then, at the preaching of Elias, while it collects all which it shall find, it receives in a manner more fully what it has lost." [...] , [...] "John is spoken of as to come in the spirit and power of Elias, because, as Elias shall precede the second Coming of the Lord, so John preceded His first. For as Elias <b>will</b> <b>come,</b> <b>as</b> precursor of the Judge, so John was made the precursor of the Redeemer. John then was Elias in spirit; he was not Elias in person.
