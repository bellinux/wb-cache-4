25|$|Charles Vine, who {{had been}} beguiled with Kate Claxton's nerve, <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from those stairs. Claxton's assurances had induced him to wait in his seat for a few minutes, but the crowd growing on the stairs made him uneasy. The sight of men {{trampling}} women appalled him; the din was maddening. He thought everyone was going crazy. Above all, dense smoke was beginning to fill the gallery, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, the UN investigative {{committee}} {{said that the}} Israeli naval blockade of Gaza was legal, but that Israel used excessive force and should have waited to enforce the blockade closer to the shoreline. It also concluded that Turkey should have taken action {{to try to prevent}} the flotilla from taking place. In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used excessive force and boarded the flotilla when it <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the blockade zone.|$|E
25|$|While Michaud's Army of the Rhine {{received}} {{instructions to}} lay siege to Mainz, Moreaux {{was ordered to}} make preparations to capture Luxembourg. The fortress had served the Habsburg Austrians as a major supply base during their military operations against France. Seizing Luxembourg was expected to yield enormous stocks of accumulated military supplies. Since the nearest enemy army <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> on the opposite bank of the Rhine, there was little risk that the Allies might relieve the city. For this mission, Moreaux assembled 19,800 soldiers in the divisions of Jean-Jacques Ambert, Jean-Baptiste Debrun and Guillaume Péduchelle. These were formed into two columns, including one under Debrun which approached on the Liège road starting on 19 November 1794.|$|E

25|$|Winter {{then went}} to see Wurmbrand at Dominee Dana Minnaar's house, hoping to clear up misunderstandings and bring about reconciliation. Winter said that he sympathised with the plight of persecuted Christians in Romania, but that Romania <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away,</b> and Christians in Namibia {{had to face the}} evils of apartheid, which were far more immediate. Wurmbrand said that this was being parochial; South Africa did not aim at world domination, but {{communism}} did, therefore Winter should concentrate his energies on fighting communism. As he was leaving, Winter knelt down in front of Wurmbrand and asked for his blessing. Wurmbrand refused at first, but Winter insisted, saying that he wanted the blessing of one who had suffered for his faith.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> {{from the}} centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this {{did not mean that}} the local students did not {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the {{bureaucracy}} was dominated by El Temür, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the empire, the actual impact of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature on the government as a whole was limited. El Temür eventually seized control of the academy in early 1332, just six months before the death of Tugh Temür. The academy had come to an end after Tugh Temür's death. Although El Tegüs was still alive, on his deathbed Tugh Temür expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother, Kusala, and his intention to pass the throne to Toghon Temür. After Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür died on 2 September 1332, Kuśala's second son Rinchinbal was installed by El Temür only at the age of six because Toghon Temür <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the central government.|$|E

25|$|The new Army of the North {{commander}} Jean-Charles Pichegru, {{ordered an}} attack on Le Cateau-Cambrésis on 29 March 1794. The divisions of Balland and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet advanced from Guise, while Fromentin moved from Avesnes-sur-Helpe. In the Battle of Le Cateau, the French were beaten {{with the loss of}} 1,200 casualties and four guns, while the Austrians only lost 293 men. On 17 and 18 April, Coburg's army drove back Balland, Goguet and Fromentin to open the Siege of Landrecies. In the operation, the 60,000-man Coalition army sustained 1,000 casualties including 627 Austrians, while the French lost over 2,000 killed, wounded and missing as well as 24 field guns. Since Pichegru <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> at Lille, Balland as the senior general on the spot ordered a counter-stroke. The attack on 21 April was repulsed with the loss of 500 killed and four guns. One of the dead was Goguet, shot down by mutinous group of his own men.|$|E
25|$|Trying {{to follow}} Napoleon's last orders, Junot {{dispatched}} General of Brigade Jean-Jacques Avril and 3,000 troops toward Badajoz. Avril reached the frontier {{to find his}} force faced by a body of artillery-armed Spanish militia behind the Guadiana River. Hearing that Dupont never got beyond Córdoba and that Badajoz was held large numbers of Spanish troops, the French general backtracked to Estremoz in Alentejo Province. On 12 June, General of Division Louis Henri Loison marched east from Almeida in Beira Province with a brigade. He cleared the Spanish garrison from Fort Concepcion and reached the environs of Ciudad Rodrigo. At this time he received intelligence that the city held a considerable garrison, Spain was in revolt, and Bessières <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away.</b> Returning to Almeida on the 15th, he heard that Porto was teetering {{on the edge of}} rebellion. Taking 2,000 men and a few cannons, he set out for Porto but on 21 June stumbled into a hornet's nest of guerillas who sniped at him and rolled boulders down from the heights. Loison decided that his small force was overmatched and withdrew to Almeida.|$|E
25|$|In 1983–1984, however, {{approximately}} 90 employees {{left the}} newspaper after a rift over Becerra Acosta's management style. They were angry {{because they believed}} that Unomásunos management had abused the good faith of its employees, <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from its editorial roots, that {{the board of directors}} was too conservative, and that it had anti-syndical tendencies. They were also angry that Becerra Acosta reportedly accepted a loan from the government to help Unomásuno through its financial difficulties. In their eyes, Unomásuno was sacrificing its autonomy by accepting the government's help. The defectors of Unomásuno, headed by journalists Payán, Lira Saade, Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa, Héctor Aguilar Camín, and Ricardo Alemán, formed a competing daily newspaper known as La Jornada on September 19, 1984. La Jornada established its reputation among Mexican readers as a leading opposition newspaper for its anti-political establishment publications, while Unomásunos readership declined and became more irrelevant nationwide throughout the start of the 1990s. Unomásunos editorial tone moved to the political right after separating from La Jornada and lost its independent orientation because of its ties with the government.|$|E

500|$|About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, [...] "there was no ambiguity". Baldwin {{was nothing}} but heroic {{in the face of}} his {{debilitating}} leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history can be seen as an apologia, a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland {{under the}} false pretext that the Poles had {{carried out a}} series of {{sabotage}} operations against German targets near the border. Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France, followed by the fully independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth—Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September), New Zealand (3 September), and South Africa (6 September)—declared war on Germany. However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the Saarland., observes that, {{while it is true that}} Poland <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away,</b> making it difficult for the French and British to provide support, [...] "ew Western historians of World War II... know that the British had committed to bomb Germany if it attacked Poland, but did not do so except for one raid on the base of Wilhelmshafen. The French, who committed to attack Germany in the west, had no intention of doing so." [...] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort. Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E

2500|$|By 863 Presian's {{successor}} Khan BorisI {{had decided}} to accept Christianity. The sources do not mention the reasons behind this decision but there were several political rationales that he had considered. As Christianity was spreading further into Europe in the 9th century the pagan countries found themselves encircled by Christian powers which could use religion as an acceptable excuse for aggression. Conversion {{on the other hand}} would establish the country as an equal international partner. There is evidence that Bulgaria did have contacts with the Muslim world as welleither directly or through Volga Bulgaria that had adopted Islam at about the same timebut the country <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from any Muslim country that could be of any political benefit, and large part of the population had already been Christian. Furthermore, the Christian doctrine would cement the monarch's position high above the nobility as an autocrat, being ruler [...] "by the grace of God" [...] and God's representative on Earth. Moreover, Christianity presented excellent opportunity to firmly consolidate both Bulgars and Slavs in a single Bulgarian people under common religion.|$|E
