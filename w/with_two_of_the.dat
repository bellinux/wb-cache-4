5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Pennsylvania <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three honors {{available}} to her, Morton was appointed as resident physician at the Alumnae Hospital and Dispensary, {{where she worked}} until 1899. She then began further studies in Europe, travelling to Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and London. During this time Morton took courses, observed surgeries, and wrote a number of scientific papers including several comparing the health of women and men. Following the advice of her instructor in London, Victor Horsley, she then travelled to the British Government Laboratory in Mumbai for six months to work on prophylactics against the bubonic plague {{as well as a}} period in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{launching}} of the Invincibles to just after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired. The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships. The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the Entente cordiale in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente. Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new dreadnought-type design. Britain also boasted very cordial relations <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significant new naval powers, Japan (bolstered by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the USA. These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the Dreadnought, ensured that she rather than the Invincible became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms-race sparked by the Dreadnought.|$|E

5|$|Canada {{was renamed}} Almirante Latorre {{once again and}} {{formally}} {{handed over to the}} Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed Plymouth the same day <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destroyers, and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, Arturo Alessandri. Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy. The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake, and to Talcahuano for the grand opening of a new naval drydock in 1924. In 1925, with the fall of the January Junta, the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{fighters were}} sent to strafe from low altitude, German ground targets ahead of the British infantry, roving behind German lines, attacking infantry, transport, gun-teams and machine-gun nests; the attacks {{continued}} all day, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British aircraft being shot down. Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at Bisseghem and Marcke near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at Ramegnies Chin, Coucou, Bisseghem (again) and Rumbeke. Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy to Warneton, led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes. German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps observation aircraft over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day. After dark, the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton, Menin and Courtrai. Ignorance of the situation at {{the northern end of}} the II Anzac Corps front was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June.|$|E

5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children near Grosvenor Place, she {{was confronted}} by Lucan and two private detectives. They {{told her that the}} children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{pinpoint}} the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his book {{over a period}} of decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time (Burchfield 1987, p.280). Since it is apparently an autograph, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events {{that could be used to}} identify the period of composition more precisely.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch, {{concerned}} about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan {{to send him}} back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the Opten Noort from Tanjung Priok and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed {{that he was to}} be married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he had barely met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam– and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.|$|E

5|$|The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II (in the {{indigenous}} language Mapuche, Pulqúi: Arrow) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank {{in the late}} 1940s in Argentina, under the Perón government, and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unrealized fighter project, the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza Aérea Argentina. The Pulqui II's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes. Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora, the political, economic and technical challenges faced by the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential, and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F-86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of continuing development of {{the indigenous}} fighter to production status.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Legislature {{created a}} statewide system of {{unsigned}} legislative routes in 1908, <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> routes using parts {{of what is}} now NY63. The stretch of NY63 connecting Dansville to Hampton Corners in the town of Mount Morris became part of Route15, a highway continuing south to Hornell and north through Mount Morris to Caledonia. Farther north, the piece between Medina and Ridgeway was designated as part of Route30, a cross-state route running from Niagara Falls to Rouses Point. Route30 originally followed current NY31 to Rochester; however, it was realigned on March1, 1921, to use Ridge Road instead, bypassing the Medina–Ridgeway highway.|$|E
5|$|Watchmen is a 2009 film {{based on}} the twelve-issue graphic novel series {{of the same name}} created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins, {{published}} by DC Comics between 1986 and 1987. The graphic novel's film rights were acquired by producer Lawrence Gordon in 1986. Many problems halted the adaptation's development, with four different studios and various directors and screenwriters being attached to the project through twenty years. In 2006, Zack Snyder, who at the time was filming 'another comic book adaptation', was hired by Warner Bros. to helm Watchmen. Filming started in 2007, and following deals <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous companies involved in the development—Paramount Pictures was responsible for international distribution rights after budgetary issues in 2004, resulting in a lawsuit by 20th Century Fox.
