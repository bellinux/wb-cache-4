5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able}} to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} night, the duce {{received}} a kind letter from Badoglio, explaining {{the necessity of}} his custody, and asking him <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be brought.

25|$|His parents, {{upon his}} graduation, {{had decided to}} give him a monthly {{allowance}} of $200 out of their earnings from Cobblestone Gardens, a substantial sum in those days. It was enough to keep him going, and indeed it guaranteed his survival for the next twenty-five years, arriving with welcome regularity. The allowance was a ticket to freedom; it allowed him to live <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> and to forgo employment.|$|E
25|$|After {{several weeks}} in Ranofotsy Bay, Italian Father Luigi Mariana, with 3 Portuguese sailors {{and quite a}} few of their slaves, walked over to the Trano Vato (near Vinanibe) <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} a chapel and house that he and Father Freire could use as a base for their missionary efforts. They chose this site as they wanted to focus their efforts on King Chambanga and his people. After several weeks of work, having constructed both buildings, a 10m cross was also raised at this site, with another one planted which overlooked Ranofotsy bay.|$|E
25|$|By 2005, Gilani's {{training}} {{had advanced}} to the point <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fight in Kashmir. Instead, Gilani was referred to Sajid Mir, LeT's foreign recruiter. Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally {{changed his name to}} David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change {{would make it easier for}} Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist.|$|E

500|$|On Diorama, Silverchair {{worked with}} a new producer, David Bottrill, who {{replaced}} Nick Launay. Though Launay had produced the band's three previous albums, lead singer Daniel Johns decided that he needed someone [...] "who understood <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go". Johns believed Diorama would be [...] "the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were really going to hate", and needed a producer who would understand the band's new direction. He interviewed several candidates, eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co-producer himself.|$|E

When Franco was at a point in his life <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.|$|E
500|$|The year 1994 {{started with}} annual {{conventions}} in each county, scheduled between 15 January and 6 April. These conventions elected {{delegates to the}} national convention. Tension had mounted between party leader Carl I. Hagen and other factions in the party. Parts of the central committee were skeptical to Hagen's position and policies. In addition, the youth wing, Youth of the Progress Party, had experienced disagreements with the Hagen-led Progress Party. The leader of the Youth of the Progress Party, Lars Erik Grønntun, {{had been on the}} verge of stepping down, but was persuaded around the end of 1993 to run for re-election.

500|$|This simple tactic proved unstoppable. Soon, he had {{surpassed the}} 50-point barrier, causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff {{to fire up}} the {{previously}} sleepy crowd. Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple-teamed by the Knicks, who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center. McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls, but Chamberlain could not be stopped. He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125–106 lead {{by the end of}} the third quarter. His own total stood at 69, nine shy of his previous scoring record. The Knicks' third center, Dave Budd, who alternated with the foul-troubled Imhoff at pivot, later stated that resistance was futile: [...] "You couldn't play [...] conventionally because he was so big. The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him, and in that case they'd try to lob it in to him, or beat him down the floor and set up <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get and force him out a couple of extra steps. The guy weighed 300 or 270 , so that wasn't easy, either." [...] Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73-point scoring record (for a regulation 48-minute game) or his record 78 points, set in triple overtime.|$|E

50|$|Camaro Challenge: Icy Corner: The {{objective}} of this challenge is to approach a simulated icy corner at 50 km/h, brake sharply to slow the car down, and gradually release the brake to negotiate the corner without skidding. Each driver has five runs. Before his first run, Kevin reveals to Andrew that he uses a walkie-talkie in his car to get directions from Lenny, and despite acknowledging it {{as a factor in}} the accident he suffered in the previous year, he still defends it as being a good idea, much to Andrew's exasperation. Kevin subsequently has to be guided throughout the challenge, as Lenny calls out his speed and tells him when to brake on every run, but Kevin fails each time due to driving too fast and/or braking too late, along with not looking <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go. Bizarrely, Dale remembers that she passed the challenge in Canada's Worst Driver 6, but completely forgets that Philippe taught her a lesson on how to complete the challenge minutes beforehand, much to Andrew's concern. She fails her first two runs due to braking too late, and on the third run she successfully completes the challenge, but the experts refuse to acknowledge this as a pass since Danny guided her during every step of the run. Michael passes with ease on his first go, correctly remembering <b>to</b> look <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go. In each of his runs, Shelby locks up the brakes and fails <b>to</b> look <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go; on top of that he goes too slowly in his final run, failing all five. Sly drives far too fast (at 70 km/h) in his first three runs and fails each time. Prior to his fourth run Andrew and Fred decide to tell him about this, but he still drives slightly too fast on his remaining two runs, failing them both.|$|R
