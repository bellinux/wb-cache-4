5|$|Although {{the poor}} sound quality limits its {{commercial}} appeal, the album provides historic {{insight into the}} group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> were awarded full rights to the performances.|$|E
5|$|Davis' first {{assignment}} was the 312th Bombardment Group based at Bowman Field in Louisville, Kentucky. There, he was qualified {{to fly the}} P-40 Warhawk fighter plane. He was trained there until August 1943 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was ordered to the Pacific Theater of Operations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> was inactivated on 25 October 1957 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> parent wing {{adapted the}} Tri-Deputate {{organization}} and the operational fighter squadrons were assigned directly to the wing.|$|R

5|$|In Milford, New Hampshire, a {{group of}} high school faculty members meet to discuss various social events. The adults {{initially}} appear to be socially conservative, debating whether students should perform the musical Grease or Jesus Christ Superstar. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> ends the meeting in a prayer, they recite a Satanic chant.|$|E
5|$|Production began {{during a}} {{transitional}} period <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was moving from its cabaret style towards a more pop/rock format; {{by the time}} the film was completed, the band had shortened its name to Oingo Boingo.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} scaly-breasted munias tend {{to adopt the}} scrounger tactic when food is more clumped and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> size increases. When most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to {{discover}} new food patches is greater.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen-year-old British schoolgirl who drowned while {{crossing}} a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007. Her death, {{the first to}} occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions, made national news headlines in the United Kingdom. She was {{with a group of}} students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> got into difficulties {{crossing a}} stream. Shaw slipped into the water and was washed downstream. She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she died {{in the early hours of}} the next morning.|$|E
50|$|Before {{closing the}} combat {{chapter of the}} 373d's history, mention should {{be made of the}} mission {{conducted}} on 20 March 1945, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group's</b> pilots destroyed or damaged 119 enemy aircraft on the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> {{continued}} training {{and participating in}} various air defense exercises until 8 December 1957, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> squadrons, were reassigned directly to the 50th Fighter-Bomber Wing, which converted to the dual deputy organization model, with a deputy wing commander for operations and staff replacing <b>the</b> <b>group</b> headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes one {{can even}} simply write G = H. Whether such a {{notation}} is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context.

5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Tommy Aldridge {{filled in}} on drums when Brian Downey was unable to, {{and became a}} full member when Downey left shortly thereafter. This line-up {{remained}} stable through to 2000, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> recorded a live album, One Night Only. The band went on to tour the US playing clubs in early 2001, but Wharton had already left the band {{by the time of}} the tour. From 2000 to 2003, Mendoza toured with Ted Nugent, and with Whitesnake in 2004. Sykes released two solo albums during 2002–03, while Gorham worked with his band 21 Guns. Thin Lizzy performed sporadically during this period, recruiting some musicians for single tours, such as bass guitarist Guy Pratt for the Global Chaos Tour of 2003.|$|E
50|$|RCA {{gave up on}} <b>the</b> Four Lovers <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> fifth {{straight}} single {{failed to}} chart in 1957 and finally dropped <b>the</b> <b>group</b> from its label. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> promptly signed to Epic Records but was quickly dropped when its first single for the label also failed to chart. As a consequence, <b>the</b> discouraged <b>group</b> temporarily disbanded.|$|R
50|$|The United Farmers of Ontario, as led by Morrison, could {{sometimes}} take stances {{widely regarded}} as bizarre and irrational. For example, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>grouping</b> was <b>the</b> leading element in Ontario's government, Morrison's UFO articulated hostility {{to the idea of}} good roads.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group’s</b> debut LP “Procession ‘Live’ at Sebastians” (recorded on 3 April 1968) {{failed to}} chart, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> decided to {{relocate}} to the UK {{in search of a}} wider audience. The band's final Australian show was at the Royale Ballroom on 18 June 1968 alongside The Twilights and The Virgil Brothers.|$|R
5|$|In the afternoon, {{one company}} of the 2nd Scots Guards probed toward Bardia, the {{infantry}} coming under heavy machine gun fire from three positions as they neared Sollum barracks. A group of Universal Carriers—commanded by Sergeant F. Riley—charged the gun positions and quickly neutralised them, but one carrier was disabled <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was subsequently engaged by anti-tank guns. Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the Military Medal, the battalion's first decoration of the war.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem and Dopesmoker are {{the final}} albums by the American heavy metal band Sleep. The albums were {{released}} in 1999 and 2003 respectively. The music for these albums was written during a four-year period <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{was working on}} a single song that was around an hour in length. Sleep had signed with London Records, which financed the album. When recording had finished, London Records was unhappy with the finished product and refused to release it. The album was later released in various forms by different record labels. All versions of the album received very positive reception from music critics, who described it as a high-water mark in both the stoner metal and doom metal genres.|$|E
5|$|Set {{during a}} fictional version of Japan in the pre-Meiji period, Sanosuke {{is a former}} member of the Sekihō Army. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> is {{destroyed}} by the Meiji Government, he becomes a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin, who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. After that encounter, Sanosuke becomes Kenshin's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.|$|E
50|$|Red & White {{evolved into}} Red & White United Transport Ltd, formed in 1937, which owned bus and road freight {{companies}} in the United Kingdom and southern Africa. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> UK bus interests were sold to the British Transport Commission in 1950, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{changed its name to}} United Transport Company.|$|R
50|$|Implicit {{partisanship}} is {{the heightened}} attractiveness and identification to a self-related group and negative or neutral attitudes towards non-self-related groups. Greenwald, Pickrell, and Farnham et al. (2002) demonstrated this effect even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> were cooperative and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> were non-human. Much {{of the research}} on implicit partisanship suggests that this is an uncontrollable process, or an implicit attitude towards self-related groups.|$|R

5|$|The Hogettes were a {{group of}} 12 male Washington Redskins fans who wore women's dresses, garden party hats, and pig snouts for two purposes: to cheer on their {{favorite}} NFL team and {{to raise money for}} charity. The group was founded in 1983 by Michael Torbert and became a regular fixture at Redskins games for nearly 30 years. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> announced its retirement, effective {{with the end of the}} 2012 season, it had 12 active and 15 former members, including three who have been featured in an exhibit at the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the VISA Hall of Fans.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{reached the}} village, Alder learned why {{his life had}} been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. Martin, had been promised {{to a man in}} another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>group's</b> {{association}} with Ken Livingstone {{goes back to}} 1985, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> leader, John Ross, became Livingstone's economic advisor. In <b>the</b> mid-1980s <b>the</b> <b>group</b> adopted Livingstone {{as something of a}} figurehead, regarding Arthur Scargill and Tony Benn as spent forces, and according to Atma Singh was [...] "instrumental" [...] in getting Livingstone elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee in 1987 and 1988.|$|R
