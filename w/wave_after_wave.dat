30|$|According to Fig.  15, water {{particles}} {{around the}} explosion crater obviously {{move toward the}} center of crater in the middle of model after being released in the beginning of simulation. Like the dam failure model, this displacement produces positive and negative waves.

According to the simulation results, a reflection wave is produced and it is separated from disturbance center in the opposite direction to positive <b>waves</b> <b>after</b> positive <b>waves</b> collide with each other. Initial negative and reflected waves continue to affect each other and produce a complex wave field. In addition to this phenomenon, water particles also split from the main waterbody and interact again during the collision process due to the properties of the Lagrangian model; hence, this may increase the nonlinearity of phenomenon.|$|R
