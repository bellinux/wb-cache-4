40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the physiological response of an in-line submaximal skate on two surfaces using two <b>wheel</b> <b>types</b> and two bearing types. The variables measured were V 0 $ sb 2 $ and HR. Ten male varsity hockey players volunteered as subjects. The subjects, after being assigned one of two <b>wheel</b> <b>types</b> with varying durometers, skated the submaximal test twice for each surface (concrete and asphalt) using a different type of bearing (precision and semi-precision) each time. These results were compared to a similar on-ice submaximal skating test session. Results revealed no significant difference between in-line skating with wheels of 78 and 82 Shore A durometers (p $<$. 05) with both V 0 $ sb 2 $ and HR as markers. A significant difference was found between in-line skating with precision and semi-precision bearings with V 0 $ sb 2 $ as a marker (p $<$. 05), however, not with HR as a marker (p = 0. 31). On-ice skating was significantly different from in-line skating on concrete and asphalt surfaces for both physiological markers. In-line skating on asphalt and concrete surfaces resulted in similar physiological responses. It was concluded that hockey players training with in-line skates obtain the same training benefits using either wheel durometers, but will have greater oxygen costs when training with semi-precision bearings than training with precision bearings...|$|R
50|$|During the Harappan Period (Harappa Phase, 2600...1900 BC) {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} increase in terracotta cart and <b>wheel</b> <b>types</b> at Harappa and other sites throughout the Indus region. The diversity in carts and wheels, including depictions of what may be spoked wheels, during this period of urban expansion and trade may reflect different functional needs, as well as stylistic and cultural preferences. The unique fonns and the early appearance of carts in the Indus valley region suggest that they are the result of indigenous technologicaldevelopment and not diffusion from West Asia or Central Asia as proposed by earlier scholars.|$|R
