25|$|The {{adoption}} support {{found by}} the 2012-15 surveys in the above table, was detected while a majority of Poles in the same surveys said they expected the euro adoption would negatively impact the Polish economy. In example, 58% of the surveyed in May 2012 had this belief. A later poll for the German Marshall Fund published in September 2012, even found 71% of Poles believed an immediate switch to the euro <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> for the Polish economy.|$|E
25|$|Romney and Huntsman clashed over China, with Romney {{saying that}} America {{was in the}} middle of a trade war with China, who must be taken to the World Trade Organization over {{currency}} manipulation. Huntsman replied that China can't be taken to the WTO and starting a trade war with them <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> for the American economy. The debate itself was criticised for not spending sufficient time on the Eurozone crisis, with only the very last question devoted to it, which only Huntsman was given the opportunity to answer.|$|E
25|$|Euro {{adoption}} {{will require}} the approval {{of at least two}} thirds of the Sejm to make a constitutional amendment changing the official currency from the złoty to the euro. The ruling Law and Justice Party opposes euro adoption. Former PM Donald Tusk has said that he may agree to a referendum on euro participation in order to gain their support for a constitutional amendment. Public opinion is against participation according to polls, with more than 70 percent believing that adoption of the euro <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> for the Polish economy according to one poll from September 2012.|$|E

500|$|The Ramah Navajo Chapter was {{represented}} by Carter G. Phillips, who argued {{that this was a}} simple contract case to which the Ferris doctrine applied. [...] The Chapter contracted with the United States to perform a service and completed its obligations, and the United States breached the contract by refusing to pay according to the terms of the contract. [...] The statute, in addition to establishing that contract support costs were to be paid, also mandated the use of a model contract, reducing the BIA's ability to modify the terms of the contract. [...] To allow the government to breach <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> public policy, where no contractor to the government could be assured of receiving payment. [...] Phillips noted that the statute was clear, and if it was not, the canons of statutory construction required that the ambiguity be resolved in the tribes favor.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the sources}} agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a miller named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller. The {{historian}} Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth. The novelist Sir Walter Scott, who took {{a keen interest in}} the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that [...] "there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed", as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with whisky, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been [...] "practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics".|$|E

2500|$|A Spring 2013 Pew Research poll in the United States {{found that}} 38% of Americans would want life {{extension}} treatments, and 56% would reject it.
