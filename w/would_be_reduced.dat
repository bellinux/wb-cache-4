5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} June 2013, Labor's {{standing}} in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border.

5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> proportionally.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 1864, the 22nd broke {{camp and}} marched {{southeast}} from Rappahannock Station. Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant had now assumed command of Union forces as general-in-chief and although Major General George Meade remained {{in command of}} the Army of the Potomac, Grant was determined to follow the army in the field, directing its movements. The resulting campaign during the spring of 1864 was known as the Overland Campaign and saw relentless attacks {{on the part of the}} Union army under Grant. The reinforced 22nd began the campaign with about 300 men. By the close of the campaign, the regiment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to about 100.|$|E

The German and British teams were not {{national}} {{teams in the}} current sense of the word: Moseley Wanderers RFC represented Great Britain and the Frankfurt Club represented Germany. Rules were also different from today's; 3 points, not 5, were awarded for tries and 4, not 3, were given for a drop goal. Also, 4 points were awarded for a goal from mark, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to 3 points in 1905 and eliminated completely in 1977.

5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB.

The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} had no plans to sell NSB.|$|E

5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E

The closure was without warning; visitors who had arrived for scheduled events found a paper notice at the entrance that the center was temporarily closed. The next days' events involving chef Andrew Carmellini and singer Joni Morris were also abruptly cancelled; the museum later stated that it would reopen on December 1. On that day, the organization (with $80 million ($ today) in debt) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The federal bankruptcy court blocked a $2 million ($ today) emergency loan with priority in security, leaving Copia with no funds to resume operations.|$|E
5|$|Melanie Barnett-Davis is {{a fictional}} character, portrayed by actress Tia Mowry, who {{appears in the}} American sitcom The Game, which aired on the CW Television Network and BET from 2006 to 2015. Introduced in a {{backdoor}} pilot on the sitcom Girlfriends as the cousin of Joan Clayton (Tracee Ellis Ross), Melanie chooses to support her boyfriend Derwin Davis' (Pooch Hall) career with the San Diego Sabres, a fictional National Football League (NFL) team, rather than attend medical school at Johns Hopkins University. The series focuses primarily on Melanie and Derwin's complicated relationship, with her fears of his infidelity {{at the center of}} many of the episodes' storylines. Mowry left the series in 2012 upon learning that her role <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> as a result of co-star Pooch Hall's decision to leave The Game to appear in the crime drama series Ray Donovan.

5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent.

5|$|The line {{operated}} successfully and settlements of people {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in the mines grew around the Brendon ridge.

5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> by half.

The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E
