5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly <b>wash</b> <b>out.</b> However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E
50|$|This {{acceleration}} of erosional channel degradation {{has resulted in}} the collapse of several bridges. In 1955 a flood <b>washed</b> <b>out</b> the old U.S. Highway 61 bridge at Kingston, the Illinois Central Railroad bridge at Rosetta, and a country road bridge on the tributary Second Creek. In 1969 a bridge on the tributary Crooked Creek was <b>washed</b> <b>out,</b> and in 1971 the State Highway 33 bridge at Rosetta was <b>washed</b> <b>out.</b> During the flood of 1974 both the State Highway 33 bridge and the Illinois Central bridge at Rosetta were <b>washed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} first match of the Ashes series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a {{boundary}} but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, {{a member of the}} ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another <b>wash</b> <b>out.</b> With the series locked at 11, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 21. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, Wisden praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings.|$|E
25|$|Using beeswax to make dreads {{can cause}} {{problems}} {{because it does}} not <b>wash</b> <b>out,</b> due to the high melting point of natural wax. Because wax is a hydrocarbon, water alone, no matter how hot, {{will not be able to}} remove wax.|$|E

25|$|During the Manhattan Project {{to develop}} the nuclear bomb in the early 1940s the {{chemical}} toxicity of uranium was an issue. It was found that uranium oxides stick very well to cotton cloth, and did not <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> with soap or laundry detergent. However, the uranium would <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> with a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. Clothing can become contaminated with toxic dust of depleted uranium (DU), which is very dense, and hence used for counterweights in a civilian context, and in armour-piercing projectiles. DU is not removed by normal laundering; washing with about 6 ounces (170 g) of baking soda in 2 gallons (7.5 l) of water will help to wash it out.|$|E

25|$|Combat Controller training, {{which is}} {{nearly two years}} long, {{is among the most}} {{rigorous}} in the US military. The CCT pipeline has a <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> rate upwards of 90–95%, mostly due to self-eliminations, injuries sustained during training, and academic failures. The Air Force is working to lower the washout rate through proper education, testing and rigorous pre-pipeline training.|$|E
25|$|After eating pareve food cooked on meat dishes, {{one must}} <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> one's mouth and wait at least 36 minutes before {{consuming}} dairy foods. One must {{also make the}} appearance of a separate meal due to concerns of mar'it 'ayin. If the food being consumed after the meat is pareve, but prepared on dairy equipment, the 36-minute waiting period is not necessary, but the mouth must be washed.|$|E

25|$|According to Tim Garrett, an {{assistant}} professor of meteorology at the University of Utah involved in the study of Arctic haze at the university, mid-latitude cities contribute pollution to the Arctic, and it mixes with thin clouds, allowing them to trap heat more easily. Garret's study found that during the dark Arctic winter, when there is no precipitation to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> pollution, the effects are strongest, because pollutants can warm the environment up to three degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
25|$|Generally yarn is skeined {{directly}} after spinning or plying. This {{is because}} after spinning or plying the yarn generally gets washed, and a skein {{is the best}} form to have the yarn in for washing. Although balls are easier for knitters and crocheters to use because they don't get tangled as easily, yarn is sometimes taken from a ball and reskeined {{in order to measure}} the yardage of leftover yarn, store it without tension, or to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> kinks if the yarn was unraveled.|$|E
25|$|There was a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Wood River, and the steamer used its paddle wheel to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> the sand to create a channel deep enough to allow the steamer to pass. This took 24hours, and the sand washed away {{accumulated}} under the hull of the boat, so that the vessel could not move forward off of the bar. In backing off the bar, the hull became permanently hogged, that is, flexed so that the middle part of the boat was raised and the bow and the stern drooped lower into the water.|$|E

25|$|Nutrient {{losses in}} runoff and {{leachate}} are {{often associated with}} agriculture. Modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to maximise production. However, farmers frequently apply more nutrients than are taken up by crops or pastures. Regulations aimed at minimising nutrient exports from agriculture are typically far less stringent than those placed on sewage treatment plants and other point source polluters. It should be also noted that lakes within forested land are also under surface runoff influences. Runoff can <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow, natural eutrophication.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the January 1972 Campaign Z, and its two counters, Operation Strength and Operation Strength II, the strategic Lao guerrilla base at Long Tieng was at serious risk of capture by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) until the rainy season gummed up military operations. On 26 April, Royalist radio intercepts began reporting the withdrawal of the PAVN 312th Division as early as 26 April 1972. On 17 May 1972, the rains came. The 312th Division had been withdrawn from the Plain of Jars (PDJ) to fight in the Easter Offensive striking South Vietnam; this considerably weakened the Communist forces in northern Laos. The Vietnamese Communist supply lines began to literally bog down and <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> in the monsoon downpour.|$|E
