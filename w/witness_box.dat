His court at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, was {{converted}} to accommodate the case by raising {{the height of the}} bench and <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> and installing new seating. In May it was announced that the case would start on 1 June, and that entry to the court would be by ticket only.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

These historical personalities range from mughal emperors Babur and Aurangzeb, Spanish adventurer Hernando Cortez, Lord Mountbatten, Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein, along with political leaders, religious zealots and even scheming Gods of mythology, many are accused of creating innumerable divided nations and people, and a legacy of hatred and distrust. The only arbiter standing for the humanity, is an unnamed abeed, littérateur.

In 10th grade, students take a Trial Advocacy and Criminal Law course in a classroom that replicates a courtroom, complete with <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> jury box, defense/prosecution tables, etc. In the next two years, students can choose {{from a variety of}} electives, including Latin, forensic science, philosophy, international law, AP Government, and other law-related courses to fulfill the remaining law credits required for graduation in accordance with the Law and Public Policy magnet.|$|E
25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} unsworn {{statement}} from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the <b>witness</b> <b>box.</b> In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.|$|E
500|$|Gordon-Cumming was {{replaced}} in the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> by the prince. Examined by Clarke, {{he stated that}} he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen [...] "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and [...] "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" [...] To the first question the prince replied {{that he had not}}, although he explained that [...] "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that [...] "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for The New York Times noticed [...] "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands still... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". The Daily News agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.|$|E

500|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{for lunch}} Gordon-Cumming {{returned to the}} <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> where he was cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost my head... on that occasion. If I had not lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E
500|$|Bamber {{was tried}} in October 1986 before Maurice Drake and a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, during a trial that lasted 19 days.

500|$|James Orsborne, giving evidence, {{said that}} he had learned from his brother about Moore's {{proposal}} {{to get rid of the}} boat, and had told George that he would be [...] "a darned fool" [...] even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because [...] "I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him". Recalled to the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> Moore {{said that he}} had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.|$|E
500|$|Bayliss's lawyer criticized Coleridge {{for having}} {{accepted}} the women's statements without seeking corroboration, and for {{speaking about the}} issue publicly without first approaching Bayliss, despite knowing that doing so could lead to litigation. Coleridge replied {{that he had not}} sought verification because he knew the claims would be denied, and that he continued to regard the women's statement as true. The Times wrote of his testimony: [...] "The Defendant, when placed in the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> did as much damage to his own case as the time at his disposal for the purpose would allow." ...|$|E
500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the <b>witness</b> <b>box.</b> She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E

500|$|Booth {{was then}} called to the witness stand, and {{initially}} claimed that Gruban had claimed to be [...] "a very powerful man" [...] {{and that it had}} been a case of Gruban using his power to help Booth, not the other way around. He was still in the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> when the court day ended, and the next morning it was announced that Christopher Addison had come to the court. The judge allowed Addison to give his testimony before they continued with Booth, and during a cross-examination by Hastings Addison stated that he had not been advising Booth in any way, and that [...] "to say that Gruban's only chance of escape from internment was to hand over his shares to Mr Booth was a lie".|$|E
500|$|Lycett Green was {{followed}} into the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> by his wife, and her testimony {{ran into the}} following day. Under questioning she confirmed that she had seldom played baccarat before; although she had seen nothing untoward on the first night, she accepted her husband's second-hand version of events as the truth, but did not agree {{that as a result}} she had been watching Gordon-Cumming. Although she [...] "gave {{the most important part of}} her evidence with clarity and conviction", and had impressed the public and press, according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, she provided a different series of events to those outlined by other witnesses, although she stated that she thought she had seen Gordon-Cumming illicitly add to his stake.|$|E
500|$|The {{barrister}} Clare Montgomery QC of Matrix Chambers {{considered the}} wider {{implications of the}} decision, wondering whether it might lead to claims against other participants in the legal process being allowed. [...] She asked rhetorically if a police officer who owed a duty of care to an individual might now be liable when giving evidence or making a statement that was a breach of that duty. [...] "The process of whittling away {{the scope of the}} immunity available to protect the participants in judicial processes appears to be far from over", she said. Penny Cooper, a professor at the City Law School in London, was concerned about a [...] "lack of clarity" [...] in the decision about who else apart from experts could be sued as a result, and commented that the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> had now become [...] "an even more scary place to be".|$|E
5000|$|He fought {{under the}} name Dave [...] "Boy" [...] McAuley, {{and was one of}} the last Irish boxers to fight for a world title over 15 rounds. His two epic fights against Fidel Bassa were both voted [...] "Fight of the Year", in 1986 and 1987 respectively. McAuley was a superb boxer who showed perhaps more bravery than any other modern Irish fighter. Anyone that was privileged enough to watch the Bassa fights would have <b>witnessed</b> a <b>boxing</b> masterclass - McAuley hauled himself off the canvas to go on and give Bassa the fright of his life.

500|$|Williams {{appeared}} at the Magistrates Court in Eastbourne for an initial hearing. He was not represented by either a solicitor or a barrister, and pleaded not guilty. On his way {{to and from the}} court Williams's head was again covered with an apron to prevent him from being photographed; the press accordingly dubbed him [...] "the hooded man." [...] The police decided that Seymour should take the witness stand as soon as possible to avoid her going back on what she had told the police. As such she was called to the <b>witness</b> <b>box</b> by Cecil Whiteley (who was Treasury Counsel at the time) to go through her statement line by line. She was physically exhausted and fainted four times in the witness box; this and other interruptions meant that the initial hearing took four days. Eventually the case was referred to the Assizes for trial.|$|E
500|$|The {{genesis of}} Trial by Jury began in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page {{illustrated}} comic {{piece for the}} magazine Fun entitled Trial by Jury: An Operetta. [...] Drawing on Gilbert's training and brief practice as a barrister, it detailed a [...] "breach of promise" [...] trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system. [...] (In the Victorian era, a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in Fun. [...] The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the <b>witness</b> <b>box,</b> the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.|$|E
500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the <b>witness</b> <b>box.</b> Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E

And as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something of the quality of a realistic dream. He was still detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved in life. What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing <b>witnessed</b> from the <b>box</b> of a theatre. [...] "I don't understand," [...] he said. [...] "What was the trouble? My mind is in a whirl. Why were they shouting? What is the danger?" ...|$|R

The true dowry for Fortunata is a psalter, a gift from Otto I to his son's wife Theofanu in honour of their marriage in 972, nearly two centuries earlier, a magnificent melding of art styles from the East and the West. Diarmaid, an Irish monk of Saint Gall, inscribed it. In awe of the beauty of its images of King David, illuminations, and colours, all declare it beyond price. Fortunata considers her dowry gift carefully, choosing to give it to her Bishop, Roger de Clinton, for the diocesan library. He says he cannot pay her near its value. She has money for it already, and the best gift that William sent her was Elave.|$|R
