A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 <b>windstorm</b> known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida <b>Windstorm</b> Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{dynamics}} {{and frequency of}} northerly <b>windstorms</b> over Iceland in current and possible future climate are discussed. These storms are relatively frequent in Iceland {{in the spring and}} in the autumn and they are also frequent during periods when there is much sea ice in the waters to the east of Greenland. Unlike most of the southerly <b>windstorms</b> in Iceland and many <b>windstorms</b> in W-Europe, many of the northerly <b>windstorms</b> are characterized by a low level-jet and a reverse vertical windshear in the lower troposphere. The spring-time northerly <b>windstorms</b> coincide with the period of maximum extent of the sea-ice north of Iceland and the frequency of these <b>windstorms</b> is reduced dramatically in a simulation of future climate. The <b>windstorms</b> are discussed in relation to blocking of cold airmasses at the east coast of Greenland. A further study {{of the impact of the}} sea-ice and Greenland on meso- and synoptic scale strong winds and the wind climate is planned during the International Polar Year (IPY) ...|$|R
5000|$|Pacific Northwest <b>windstorms,</b> {{sometimes}} colloquially {{known as}} Big Blows, [...] are extratropical cyclones which {{form in the}} Pacific basin, and affect land areas in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia, Canada. They form as cyclonic <b>windstorms</b> associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure that track across the North Pacific Ocean towards western North America. Deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the North Pacific. They are most common in the winter months. On average, the month when most <b>windstorms</b> form is December.|$|R
5|$|SSH9E was {{extended}} southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to {{a branch of}} PSH21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and {{was extended}} across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. SR104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and {{was signed into law}} in 1970. The Hood Canal Bridge, officially named after William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 <b>windstorm</b> and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South PointLofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major <b>windstorm,</b> and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend the life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.|$|E
25|$|On December 27, {{the storm}} {{developed}} into a powerful nor'easter that buffeted the East Coast, reaching its peak intensity. On December 29, the storm weakened and left the United States. During the next several days, the system moved eastward over the Atlantic Ocean. On January 2, 2011, the storm began to re-intensify, but the system continued to drift in the eastern North Atlantic for another two days. On January 4, the system was named <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin by the Free University of Berlin, which names all Low and High-Pressure systems that affect Europe. <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin continued to moved eastwards across the Atlantic, and the storm began to impact Western Europe on January 8. On January 9, <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin crossed the British Isles {{and turned to the}} northeast. For the next couple of days, <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin held its intensity as it continued moving northeastward, before weakening on January 11, due to land interaction with the northern coast of Norway. On January 12, <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin began to move inland into Western Russia, while slowly weakening. On January 13, Benjamin accelerated eastward, while rapidly continuing to deteriortate. On January 15, <b>Windstorm</b> Benjamin was absorbed into the circulation of another approaching extratropical cyclone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Forty-eight hour {{numerical}} forecasts {{during a}} period of 5 years are studied with emphasis on cases of false alarms and missed <b>windstorms</b> at 850 hPa. The overall performance of the forecast system is very good. <b>Windstorms</b> from the southwest are very well predicted, there are a few false alarms in southeasterly winds and northeasterly <b>windstorms</b> tend to be underestimated by the forecast model. The false alarms are in many cases associated with fronts, where a slight shift of a position of the weather system in time may give a large difference in the forecasted and observed winds. Yet, the true value of the forecast may be high. We attribute an underestimation in the wind speed in northeasterly <b>windstorms</b> to non-resolved orography, leading to an underestimation of the corner effect SW-Iceland, and possibly to winds that are generated by a pressure gradient at the western side of the Iceland wake...|$|R

500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone is a storm system {{characterized by a}} low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain.

50|$|In English, use of term {{hurricane}} {{to refer}} to European <b>windstorms</b> is mostly discouraged, as these storms do not display the structure of tropical storms.

40|$|Areal {{extremity}} of <b>windstorms</b> in the Czech Republic Abstract This thesis {{deals with}} the extremeness of events with strong winds in the Czech Republic in the period from 1961 to 2009. The first part {{is dedicated to the}} principles of air flow dynamics and to wind climatology. The second part describes theoretical distributions used for evaluating the extremeness of wind speed and presents various computation methods of distribution parameters and interpolation methods of converting point data to spatial information. At the end of this part, two modern indices are introduced: WEI (Weather Extremity Index) and SSI (Storm Severity Index) which use return periods and wind speeds for evaluating the extremeness of <b>windstorms,</b> respectively. The third part contains an application of the methods to the pre-processed data from meteorological stations. The fourth section presents the files of 50 most extreme and 50 seasonally most abnormal <b>windstorms</b> selected by both indices which determine in different ways the extremeness, the affected area and duration of each event. The spatial and temporal aspects of the events are discussed as well, along with their seasonal and interannual variability and causal synoptic conditions.

40|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} dominate autumn {{and winter}} weather over western Europe. The strongest cyclones, often termed <b>windstorms,</b> {{have a large}} socio-economic impact due to the strong surface winds and associated storm surges in coastal areas. Here we show that sting jets are a common feature of windstorms; up {{to a third of}} the 100 most intense North Atlantic winter <b>windstorms</b> {{over the last two decades}} satisfy conditions for sting jets. The sting jet is a mesoscale descending airstream that can cause strong near-surface winds in the dry slot of the cyclone, a region not usually associated with strong winds. Despite their localized transient nature these sting jets can cause significant damage, a prominent example being the storm that devastated southeast England on 16 October 1987. We present the first regional climatology of <b>windstorms</b> with sting jets. Previously analysed sting jet cases appear to have been exceptional in their track over northwest Europe rather than in their strength...|$|R

25|$|Biological {{diversity}} {{is dependent on}} natural disturbance. The success {{of a wide range}} of species from all taxonomic groups is closely tied to natural disturbance events such as fire, flooding, and <b>windstorm.</b> As an example, many shade-intolerant plant species rely on disturbances for successful establishment and to limit competition. Without this perpetual thinning, diversity of forest flora can decline, affecting animals dependent on those plants as well.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied by {{a strong}} jet stream in the Atlantic, the {{remnants}} of the storm crossed the British Isles on January 26. The wind and rain associated with the low was forecast to have the potential to cause disruption in the United Kingdom, and indeed there were areas that saw severe weather. During the next few days, the system accelerated towards the northeast. On January 29, the storm system was absorbed by <b>Windstorm</b> Leone, over Finland.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} {{particularly}} suited for exploiting recently disturbed sites. Vegetation {{with the potential}} for rapid growth can quickly take advantage of the lack of competition. In the northeastern United States, shade-intolerant trees like pin cherry and aspen quickly fill in forest gaps created by fire or <b>windstorm</b> (or human disturbance). Silver maple and eastern sycamore are similarly well adapted to floodplains. They are highly tolerant of standing water and will frequently dominate floodplains where other species are periodically wiped out.|$|E
