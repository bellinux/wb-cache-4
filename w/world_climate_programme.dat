50|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> (WCP) was {{established}} following the first World Climate Conference in 1979. The major sponsors are the World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Council for Science (ICSU).|$|E
50|$|The First World Climate Conference {{was held}} on 12-23 February 1979 in Geneva and {{sponsored}} by the WMO. It {{was one of the}} first major international meetings on climate change. Essentially a scientific conference, it was attended by scientists from a wide range of disciplines. In addition to the main plenary sessions, the conference organized four working groups to look into climate data, the identification of climate topics, integrated impact studies, and research on climate variability and change. The Conference led to the establishment of the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> and the World Climate Research Programme. It also led to the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by WMO and UNEP in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) was {{established}} in 1980, under the joint sponsorship of International Council for Science and the World Meteorological Organization, and has also been sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO since 1993. It is {{a component of the}} <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme.</b> The objectives of the programme are to develop the fundamental scientific understanding of the physical climate system and climate processes needed to determine to what extent climate can be predicted and the extent of human influence on climate. The programme encompasses studies of the global atmosphere, oceans, sea ice, land ice (such as glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets), and the land surface which together constitute the Earth's physical climate system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> Research <b>Programme</b> (WCRP), {{hosted by}} the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), {{coordinates}} research activities on climate modelling worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|... 1985: The <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> Research <b>Programme</b> (WCRP) {{initiated}} the TOGA (Tropical-Ocean Global Atmosphere) (1985-1995), to study interannual variability {{driven by the}} ocean-atmosphere system in the tropics.|$|R

50|$|WMO and the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) {{disseminate}} {{information on}} CLIMAT reporting via handbooks/guides, and the Manual on Codes (WMO No. 306), e.g. via the internet. For simplifying the forming of CLIMAT reports, the WMO <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> and GCOS {{have set up}} a software called “CLIREP” which provides a user interface where data can be inserted and are processed automatically to form a correct CLIMAT message. For the compilation of CLIMAT coded messages a simple text-editor is sufficient as messages can be sent as “.txt”-files. Therefore it is also possible to send CLIMAT messages via email to the GCOS Surface Network (GSN) monitoring centres that monitor and supervise the worldwide CLIMAT reporting.|$|E
30|$|The need {{to provide}} climate {{information}} to society has been recognized for many decades of years. For example, the first World Climate Conference held in 1979 by the World Meteorological Organization called for establishing a <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> with the objective to improve {{our understanding of the}} climate system and its impacts on society (Vaughan and Dessai 2014). More recently, the phrase climate services became more common to describe user-oriented approaches to make climate information available.|$|E
30|$|The {{beginnings}} of this expanded climate agenda {{were already in}} place as the second World Climate Conference (WCC- 2) was convened in 1990. WCC- 2 resulted in a restructuring of the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme,</b> introducing the explicit dimension of climate services by formulating the World Climate Applications and Services Program (WCASP), with a remit for operational climate information, prediction and analysis systems, including user liaison. WCC- 2 reformulated the WCP program on climate impacts to include consideration of impacts and responses. Both moves broadened the emphasis from the production {{to the use of}} the information.|$|E
50|$|The Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program (TOGA) was {{a ten-year}} study (1985-1994) of the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> Research <b>Programme</b> (WCRP) aimed {{specifically}} at {{the prediction of}} climate phenomena on time scales of months to years.|$|R

40|$|A global {{hydrological}} database {{is considered}} essential {{for research and}} application-oriented hydrological and climatological projects at global, regional and basin scales. This includes water balance studies, investigation of trends in long-term hydrological time series, coupling of hydrological and meteorological models, flux of fresh water and pollutants into the oceans, and the coupling of runoff with water quality data. Monitoring of runoff is indispensable for water resources planning and management on all scale levels. The principal objective of the GRDC is to collect and disseminate hydrological data to support projects within the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> (WCP) and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) {{as well as for}} other programmes such as the World Hydrological Climate Observing System (WHYCOS) of WMO and the World Bank and the Global Environment Monitoring System - Water (GEMS-Water) of UNEP and WHO.

30|$|Through discussion, {{debate and}} {{stakeholder}} consultation, the IOC’s subcommittee for the High Level Segment defined {{the vision and}} action agenda that became the conceptual underpinnings for the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). The Concept Note that was delivered to WCC- 3 participants presented a rationale, objectives and a proposed programmatic structure for the GFCS that clearly built upon existing infrastructure and activities of the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme,</b> but also transcended them through inclusion of a mechanism to actively engage the climate services practitioner communities – the User Interface Platformd. IRI was invited {{to serve on the}} IOC, and through this mechanism contributed to the planning of WCC- 3 and the visioning for GFCS. IRI interventions sought to broaden the User Interface Platform concept to include fostering institutional partnerships, cross-disciplinary research, innovation, decision-support tools, knowledge capture, evaluation, establishment of good practices, education and capacity building. This advice was based on IRI’s own experience and that of other organizations already working in the “boundary space” of climate services development.|$|E

30|$|Building on {{this growing}} body of research, the first World Climate Conference (WCC- 1) was convened in 1979. The {{findings}} stated, “Having regard to the all-pervading influence of climate on human society and on many fields of human activity and endeavor, the Conference finds {{that it is now}} urgently necessary for the nations of the world: (a) To take full advantage of man’s present knowledge of climate; (b) To take steps to improve significantly that knowledge; (c) To foresee and prevent potential man-made changes in climate that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity” (Proceedings of the World Climate Conference. Geneva 1979). A principal outcome was the creation of the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> (WCP), comprised of four component programs that addressed climate research, data, impacts and applications. Its aim was to promote and coordinate efforts to better observe, model and understand the climate system and its relation to human wellbeing. The WCP subsequently supported the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), charged with ongoing scientific assessment of climate change, its social and economic impacts and potential response strategies.|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the river discharge and other hydrological elements is basic information which is central to various kinds of hydrological investigations. Within the studies of the impacts of climate change and climate variability a great demand arises for hydrological data, such as precipitation, evaporation, runoff etc. based on a regional, continental or global scale. These hydrological data are needed for various purposes such as: global or continental water balance studies, investigating regional and global trends in hydrological time series, regional studies, estimations of inputs of water and matters into the oceans, validation of climate models simulations, coupling of hydrological and meteorological models. Within WMO's <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> the WCP-Water Project A. 5 'Collection of Global Runoff Data Sets' was created and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) was established at the Federal Institute of Hydrology in Koblenz on November 1988. Recently the WCP-Water Project A. 5 /GRDC has expanded to provide a general service for the collection and storage of internationally available sets of hydrological data. (orig.)

40|$|SummaryIn the 21 st Century, {{the peoples}} of the world are facing multi-faceted {{challenges}} of climate variability and climate change, which requires wise and well-informed decision-making at every level from households, communities, countries and regions, to international fora, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Those decisions will require, directly or indirectly, access to the best possible climate science and information, and effective application of this information through climate services. The first two World Climate Conferences in 1979 and 1990 laid the foundation for building research and observational activities {{to understand the nature of}} the climate challenges and to provide the scientific bases for developing the comprehensive and sound climate services that are now being sought by all countries and in virtually every sector of society. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and its partners convened World Climate Conference- 3 (WCC- 3) to provide nations with the opportunity to jointly consider an appropriate global framework for climate services over the coming decades that would help ensure that every country and every climate-sensitive sector of society is well equipped to access and apply the growing array of climate prediction and information services made possible by recent and emerging developments in international climate science and technology. The purpose of the Expert Segment of WCC- 3 was to engage a wide cross-section of climate scientists, expert providers of climate information and the users of climate information and services in a wide-ranging discussion on the essential elements of a new Global Framework for Climate Services for consideration by the High-level Segment of the Conference. The 200 speakers and 1500 participants in the Expert Segment:• reviewed the various elements of the shared challenge facing the climate service provider and user communities;• considered the needs and capabilities for applying climate information in key climate-sensitive sectors, as well as for – social and economic benefits;• examined the scientific basis for climate information and prediction services;• were advised on the needs and perspectives of a number of scientific, environmental and socioeconomic groups and organisations;• were informed of the experience of a wide range of countries and climate-sensitive sectors in the implementation of climate services;• concluded that:– Great scientific progress has been made especially through the <b>World</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Programme</b> and its associated activities over the past 30 years, which provides already a firm basis for the delivery of a wide range of climate services; but that– Present capabilities to provide effective climate services fall far short of meeting present and future needs and of delivering the full potential benefits, particularly in developing countries;– The most urgent need is for much closer partnerships between the providers and users of climate services; and– Major new and strengthened research efforts are required to increase the time-range and skill of climate prediction through new research and modelling initiatives; and to improve the observational basis for climate prediction and services, and the availability and quality control of climate data;• called for major strengthening of the essential elements of a global framework for climate services:– The Global Climate Observing System and all its components and associated activities; and provision of free and unrestricted exchange and access to climate data;– The World Climate Research Programme, underpinned by adequate computing resources and increased interaction with other global climate relevant research initiatives. – Climate services information systems taking advantage of enhanced existing national and international climate service arrangements in the delivery of products, including sector-oriented information to support adaptation activities;– Climate user interface mechanisms focussed on building linkages and integrating information, at all levels, between the providers and users of climate services; and– Efficient and enduring capacity building through education, training, and strengthened outreach and communication. • supported the development of the proposed Global Framework for Climate Services. – The WCC- 3 Sponsoring Agencies agreed, therefore, that the essential findings of the Expert Segment, as summarised in this Statement, should be transmitted to the High-level Segment of the Conference for the information of delegates and other Conference participants; and referred to their individual and joint executive and co-ordination bodies for follow-up action, in particular, in the context of the UN Chief Executives’ Board (CEB) initiative on the UN System Delivering as One on Climate Knowledge...|$|E
