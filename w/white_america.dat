However, in later decades critics took contending views, finding that Chan, despite his good qualities, reinforces condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. Many found it objectionable that he was played on screen by Caucasian actors in yellowface.|$|E

500|$|Angelou portrays Momma as {{a realist}} whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the {{survival}} {{and success of}} those who came after her. For example, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan, her white employer, and, {{later on in the}} book, breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco. In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism. Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her [...] "racial hatred", common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in <b>white</b> <b>America</b> is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.|$|E

Eglee explained that he and Cameron began {{with the idea that}} they could do a [...] "hip hop youth ensemble thing", noting that [...] "hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [...] in the world" [...] and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of Dark Angel the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for <b>white</b> <b>America,</b> defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would {{come to be known as}} Hip Hop.... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. [...] Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically [...] "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." [...] It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it [...] "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character". Birchmeier said many of the songs were [...] "quite impressive" [...] and that it [...] "exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack".|$|E

Gone With the Wind is a profoundly racist text. The book's true love story is not between Rhett and Scarlett but <b>white</b> <b>America's</b> affair with self, a self that can only exist through owning property as the primary means of white supremacy.|$|R

This {{sense of the term}} [...] "kindred" [...] as a {{community}} of choice is clear from Butler’s first use of the word to indicate Dana and Kevin’s similar interests and shared beliefs.
