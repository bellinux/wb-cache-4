5|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of Poland and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with British intelligence agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the Anschluss in 1938. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities. In mid to late 1940, British intelligence became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side-track the plans, preferring to continue working through Prince Paul. The SOE office in Belgrade went to significant lengths to support the opposition to the anti-Axis Cvetković government, which undermined the hard-won balance in Yugoslav politics that government represented. SOE Belgrade was entangled with pro-Serb policies and interests, and disregarded or underestimated warnings from SOE and British diplomats in Zagreb, <b>who</b> <b>better</b> understood the situation in Yugoslavia as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Hoad, seeded {{first among}} the foreign players at the U.S. Championships, failed {{to live up}} to his seeding when he lost to Ham Richardson in a five-set quarterfinal. His lackluster form {{continued}} when he was defeated by unseeded Luis Ayala in the quarterfinal of the Pacific Southwest Championships in mid-September. After returning to Australia at the end of September Hoad scheduled extra practice to work on his serve and volley but subsequently lost to Don Candy in the semifinal of the Sydney Metropolitan Championships. In early November matters briefly improved as he consolidated the Queensland title in Brisbane. In the final he overcame a sunstroke and the loss of sets three and four by 0–6 to defeat Hartwig in five sets. In mid November he was upset by veteran John Bromwich <b>who</b> <b>better</b> exploited the windy conditions in the quarterfinal of the N.S.W. Championships. At the Victorian Championships, the last significant tournament before the Davis Cup Challenge Round, Hoad was defeated in straight sets in the semifinal by Seixas. As in the previous match against Sven Davidson he showed such poor form and at times an apparent lack of interest that he was jeered by the crowd and several left after he smashed a ball into the stands. The 1954 Davis Cup Challenge Round was played on 27–29 December on the grass courts at the White City Stadium in Sydney between title holders Australia and the United States. Hoad played the first rubber, in front of a record crowd of 25,000, which he lost to world No.1 Trabert in a high-quality four-set match. Rosewall also lost his singles match and the United States won back the cup after Seixas and Trabert defeated Hoad and Rosewall in four sets in the doubles rubber. At the end of an erratic and ultimately disappointing season Hoad's world ranking slipped to No.7. In a 1956 interview Hoad admitted that especially in 1954 he often got fed-up with tennis and didn't care whether he played or not.|$|E

2500|$|The same year, Bimal Roy {{cast her}} as Chandramukhi {{opposite}} Dilip Kumar in the critically acclaimed Devdas, {{which was the}} adaptation of the novel with same title by Sharat Chandra Chatterji. The industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about Vyjayanthimala being cast in Bimal Roy's film, the response being: [...] "Why don't you take comedian Kishore Kumar as Devdas?". Initially Nargis was selected for Chandramukhi's role, but she {{refused to accept the}} role. The role was later offered to Bina Rai and Suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of Paro, which was earlier offered to Meena Kumari. Subsequently, the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point Vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of Chandramukhi, where she said to Bimal Roy, [...] "I am ready if you think I can do it". On the other hand, Nabendu Ghosh, the script writer of Devdas, said that, [...] "I did not approve of Vyjayanthimala , but we had no option – no one wanted to play Chandramukhi, and we were committed to our distributors... She was, of course, a very good actress, but she was too young for Chandramukhi, as envisioned by Saratbabu". On her performance, Rediff wrote: [...] "Vyjayanthimala imbues Chandramukhi with true sympathy. <b>Who</b> <b>better</b> than Chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless love?... Vyjayanthimala, a star after the blockbuster Nagin, still had to establish her acting credentials when Roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of Chandramukhi". While Upperstall.com describes her performance as: [...] "Vyjayantimala's Chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman, who, in love with Devdas, has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman. For Vyjayantimala, the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics, offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her, the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema– her dance". Subsequently, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress but refused to accept it, stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by Suchitra Sen and not supporting. In 2006, a poll conducted by Rediff ranked her role of Chandramukhi {{as one of the best}} Tawaif characters in Bollywood. Subsequently, the same role was listed in The Times of India's [...] "10 Celluloid Hookers You Loved" [...] at number six by Nikhat Kazmi. Though the film was critically successful, it did not garner much support at the box office and ended up as 10th highest-grossing movie of 1955 with an average verdict [...]|$|E
