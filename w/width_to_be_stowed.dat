60|$|Three steamers {{were going}} up, and each towed a barge, {{in which the}} greater part of the troops <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed,</b> and in the stern of one of these knelt two camels.|$|R
25|$|Ammunition was {{stored in}} Ammunition Bunker VII, and was {{manually}} {{moved from the}} bunker up to the gun, via a sloping concrete path, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> upright in small bays, just {{to the rear of}} the gun.|$|R
50|$|Weighing anchor {{literally}} means {{raising the}} anchor {{of the vessel}} from the sea floor and hoisting it up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> on board the vessel. At {{the moment when the}} anchor is no longer touching the sea floor, it is aweigh.|$|R
50|$|After the {{sampling}} attempt, the Sample Return Capsule (SRC) lid will <b>be</b> opened <b>to</b> allow the sampler head <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed.</b> The arm will be retracted into the launch configuration and the SRC lid {{will be closed}} and latched for the return to Earth.|$|R
50|$|Designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> in cramped {{aircraft}} cockpits, {{the rifle}} {{was made from}} lightweight plastics and aluminum alloys. The AR-5 was unique for being able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disassembled with all working parts stored within the stock. When stowed in this manner, the rifle <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> float.|$|R
40|$|Articulated beam becomes rigid {{triangular}} truss when deployed and {{is stored}} by folding it flat {{as it is}} heliced about cylinder. Beam is composed of longerons, diagonals, and scissors arms. Folding produces flat envelope that allows more beams <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> on cylinder than would be possible if beams did not fold flat...|$|R
50|$|A rounded {{indentation}} {{was carved}} into the left-hand (Brigittenau) quay wall, where the Schwimmtor <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> when it <b>was</b> not needed. Just downstream of this indentation, the quay wall jutted out {{into the middle of}} the canal, thereby forming a support against which the barrier could be placed when it was needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, Captain, I {{will send}} {{the wine and}} spirits on board the day before. Of course I shall {{get them out of}} bond; I might have {{difficulty}} in doing that so early in the morning. You will perhaps <b>be</b> good enough <b>to</b> order them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> in one of the empty cabins." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time the Soviets were {{developing}} the Yak-25E, the U.S. Air Force was experimenting with a similar system known as Project Tom-Tom. The U.S. system would have employed either a specially modified F-84 or an XF-85 Goblin parasite aircraft. Early attempts differed by attaching two fighters to the bomber's wingtips. Later plans called for a parasite aircraft <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> internally within the belly of a B-36.|$|R
50|$|The ATHLETE is {{much larger}} than robotic systems {{previously}} used and has a diameter of around 4 m and a reach of around 6 m. Even with this larger size the project has allowed the facility for multiple units <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> and docked compactly for launch into an annular ring. This would mean that many vehicles can be efficiently stacked around a main payload on a single lander.|$|R
5000|$|Two minor {{problems}} {{occurred during}} the flight. After ascent, the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter iced up and shut down, increasing the crew cabin temperature to approximately [...] The problem was resolved on Flight Day 4 and cooler temperatures resulted. A Ku-band antenna for communications was deployed on Flight Day 2, but it failed to respond properly and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> {{for the remainder of}} the mission.|$|R
60|$|Marble {{listened to}} the Major's speech with great {{attention}} and respect, fumbling in his pocket for his tobacco-box, the whole time. The box was opened just as the Major ended, and even I began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> afraid that the well-known cupidity of Kennebunk <b>was</b> about <b>to</b> give way before the temptation, and the notes <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> alongside of the tobacco but I was mistaken. Deliberately helping himself to a quid, the chief-mate shut the box again, and then he made his reply.|$|R
500|$|By October 1940, Firedrake had her rear {{torpedo tube}} mount {{replaced}} by a 12-pounder AA gun. While the ship was under repair in late 1941, 'Y' gun had <b>was</b> removed <b>to</b> allow a total of 70 depth charges <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> aboard. Several other changes also probably happened during this refit, notably two single [...] Oerlikon light AA guns were installed abreast the bridge and a Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted as was a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.|$|R
50|$|The backpack, or haversack, has eyelets and a paracord {{drawstring}} with cord lock. The lid of {{the pack}} is fastened with two straps and adjustable green buckles. On {{the underside of the}} pack lid are two straps with similar green buckles to allow a rolled poncho or waterproofs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed.</b> Two horizontal nylon straps with adjuster buckles around the outer face of the pack <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> compress the contents. On the underside is a long narrow carrier for the lightweight pick head.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] Lionel {{said as they}} stood for a minute looking on, [...] "that this would be just the thing for us. If we could make an {{arrangement}} with the captain {{of one of these}} peat boats we might hide a number of men in the hold and cover them with peat. A place might be built large enough, I should think, to hold seventy or eighty men, and yet be room for a quantity of peat <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> over them." ...|$|R

A mechanism for independent operation of footrest stowage and deployment {{is not included}} in market power wheel chairs, and PWC users have expressed the need for such a mechanism. My group research at Georgia Tech has aimed to design a solution that permits wheelchair users to independently lift and lower a center-mounted footplate during transferring processes.

50|$|Double-ended sidings (loops) {{good for}} typical {{passenger}} trains (10~12 cars) are provided at 3~8 mileintervals, at local stations. Some stations have an island platform serving middle siding tracks, and straight-through outside bypass tracks. Schedules provide extra dwell time for trains to hold until an express passes, also serving as en-route recovery time, improving reliability. Some stations in single-track territory feature three passing tracks, allowing freight or other equipment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> while opposing passenger trains pass one another. Close proximity of sidings allow TRA tosqueeze 5~6 tph (both directions, mixed traffic) out of single-tracks.|$|R
50|$|Waterfall was a town {{created by}} rail workers, {{who built the}} line from Sydney to Wollongong in the late 19th century. It is the highest point on the line, with a steep rising {{gradient}} at one end, and a falling gradient at the other end, and sidings were provided in both directions to allow freight wagons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> and shunted. Waterfall derived {{its name from the}} waterfalls close to the railway station. McKell Avenue, the southern border of the Royal National Park, was originally called Waterfall Road.|$|R
50|$|Shannon {{was armed}} with two 10-inch guns in {{armoured}} embrasures facing towards the bow, six 9-inch {{guns on the}} open deck amidships, and a seventh 9-inch gun facing astern. The astern gun could be fired from either of two unarmoured embrasures, {{one on each side}} of the ship. She was also equipped with an unusual detachable ram, which <b>was</b> meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed in peacetime to reduce the risk of accidentally ramming another warship. The ram <b>was</b> supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> on board and attached in wartime; however this proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very impractical arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} were Loire 130 single-engined flying boats. Two planes <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed,</b> wings folded, in a two-tier hangar {{on the two}} platforms of a lift, and a {{third on}} the catapult, with wings deployed, and the possibility to stow a fourth plane atop the aviation hangar. The planes were moved on rails from the hangar to an elevator, then placed on the catapult. At {{the end of its}} mission, the Loire 130 landed in the sea and taxied alongside the ship. It was then lifted aboard by a recovery crane with a capacity of 4.5 tons.|$|R
50|$|The term aweigh {{describes}} an anchor {{when it is}} hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom. This <b>is</b> linked <b>to</b> the term to weigh anchor, meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed, allowing the ship or boat to move. An anchor is described as aweigh when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed.</b> Aweigh {{should not be confused}} with under way, which describes a vessel which <b>is</b> not moored <b>to</b> a dock or anchored, whether or not the vessel is moving through the water.|$|R

We ran below and hid ourselves, and so discreetly, {{that we might have}} remained in the hole to this hour, {{had it not been for}} the necessity of re-stowing the bread lockers. You burrowed on that occasion, Quartermaster, as handily as a fox; and how the d---l you knew so well where to find the spot is a matter of wonder to me. A regular skulk on board ship does not trail aft more readily when the jib <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed,</b> than you went into that same hole." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a unique suite of mechanisms that make up the Deployment and Pointing System (DAPS) for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER/SEXTANT) instrument, an X-Ray telescope, which will be mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). The DAPS system uses four stepper motor actuators to deploy the telescope box, latch it in the deployed position, and allow it to track sky targets. The DAPS gimbal architecture provides full-hemisphere coverage, and is fully re-stowable. The compact design of the mechanism allowed the majority of total instrument volume <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for science. Override features allow DAPS <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> by ISS robotics...|$|R
2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} shelter deck for working the anchors, which <b>were</b> arranged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> in hawse pipes, and two large capstans were fitted aft on the shelter deck for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|R

50|$|The C {{class were}} ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company, Newcastle to operate {{services}} {{on the first}} railway line in Perth, the Eastern Railway from Fremantle to Guildford. However they were not ready when the line opened on 1 March 1881, with number 1 released from final assembly at Fremantle Railway Workshops the following day with number 2 entering service in May 1881. When delivered {{they did not have}} bunkers with the wood that fired them having <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> in the cabs, so bunkers were retrofitted in May 1881 and August 1881. When engine class designations were introduced in 1885, they became the C class, numbered C1 and C2.|$|R
60|$|However, the cavalcade {{moved at}} length, every coachman being {{accommodated}} with a hamper {{between his legs}} something larger than a wheelbarrow; and the company being packed as closely as they possibly could in the carriages, 'according,' as one married lady observed, 'to the immemorial custom, which was half the diversion of gipsy parties.' Thinking it very likely it might be (we have never <b>been</b> able <b>to</b> discover the other half), we submitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> away with a cheerful aspect, and <b>were</b> fortunate enough <b>to</b> occupy one corner of a coach in which were one old lady, four young ladies, and the renowned Mr. Balim the young ladies' young gentleman.|$|R

5|$|On the Eastern Front, it {{was first}} used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) {{resisting}} the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> within the turret, reducing capacity to 68. Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st {{were lost in the}} area between 12 and 13 August to ambushes and flank attacks by Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain.|$|R
2500|$|On 5 August, two {{companies}} entrained to south eastern Poland to join Army Group North Ukraine, {{to continue to}} resist Operation Bagration. After detraining, most suffered final drive breakdowns while on a [...] road march. On 11 August, the battalion <b>was</b> attached <b>to</b> 16th Panzer Division. The eight operational tanks attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s. Because these tanks suffered ammunition explosions which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stowed</b> within the turret, reducing capacity to 68.
