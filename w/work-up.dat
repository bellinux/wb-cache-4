40|$|We {{present a}} 13. 5 year old boy with chronic {{intussusception}} that was misdiagnosed as Crohn disease and received {{treatment for the}} wrong diagnosis. Because his condition didn’t improve, more <b>work-ups</b> were performed and the radiologic <b>work-ups</b> revealed the diagnosis of a missed intussusception with fistula. We suggest that prolonged intussusception {{should be considered in}} the list of differential diagnosis for the refractory abdominal pain and distention, bloody diarrhea, and radiologist consultancy should be requested, as Crohn disease, infectious gastroenteritis, abdominal malignancies and prolonged intussusception should be carefully investigated and considered in such situations...|$|R
50|$|Detroit {{returned}} to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a dry docked phased maintenance availability in July 1993. Shipyard repairs were completed in January 1994 {{and the ship}} immediately commenced <b>work-ups</b> for her next deployment.|$|R
5|$|Apart from a <b>work-up</b> {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the Italian auxiliary submarine chaser O 97 / Margherita, the Italian merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the Italian tugs Genova and Iseo, the Italian sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, the Italian tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the Italian auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E
5|$|The first RAF Phantom {{unit was}} 228 Operational Conversion Unit, which was {{stood up in}} August 1968. The Phantom entered {{operational}} service in May 1969, when 6 Squadron was formed at RAF Coningsby in the tactical strike role. 54 Squadron was formed in September the same year, followed by 41 Squadron in 1972 as a tactical reconnaissance unit. A further four squadrons were formed under RAF Germany in 1970 and 1971: 2, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons, all at RAF Brüggen. Along with their conventional strike role, 14, 17 and 31 Squadrons were assigned a tactical nuclear strike role under SACEUR, using weapons supplied by the United States. After initial <b>work-up,</b> 2 Squadron moved to and operated from RAF Laarbruch in the tactical reconnaissance role. The aircraft assigned to the two tactical reconnaissance units were fitted with a pod containing four optical cameras, an infrared linescan and a sideways looking radar.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic <b>work-up</b> {{supports}} {{the differential diagnosis}} of TMA-causing diseases. A positive Shiga-toxin/EHEC test confirms a cause for STEC-HUS, and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (i.e., ≤5% of normal ADAMTS13 levels) confirms a diagnosis of TTP.|$|E
5000|$|Upon commissioning, Exmoor {{immediately}} began acceptance trials. Upon their successful completion later in October, she steamed to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, where she performed <b>work-ups</b> with ships of the Home Fleet. After completing <b>work-ups</b> in November 1941, she {{was selected for}} patrol and convoy escort duties at Gibraltar, but before taking up those responsibilities she steamed to Derry [...] - [...] also known as Londonderry [...] - [...] in Northern Ireland and on 13 November 1941 joined her sister ship [...] and the destroyers [...] and [...] as escort of the military convoy WS12Z while it transited the Western Approaches. She was detached from the convoy on 17 November 1941.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1982, VAQ-135 was {{assigned}} to [...] and Carrier Air Wing 1 (CVW-1). After completing <b>work-ups,</b> the squadron was transferred to [...] and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in November 1982 later receiving their second Chief of Naval Operations Safety “S” Award.|$|R
30|$|Despite an easy {{clinical}} diagnosis, precise {{identification of}} colovesical fistulas is often challenging and is obtained in only 55 % of patients after extensive <b>work-ups.</b> Cystoscopy, conventional cystography, colonic enema, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy have very limited accuracy in identifying these fistulas [9 – 11].|$|R
25|$|They {{would then}} {{need to be}} {{referred}} to a specialist in sexual medicine. The specialist would check the patient's blood results for hormonal levels, thyroid function and diabetes, evaluate genital blood flow and genital sensation, as well as giving a neurological <b>work-up</b> to determine the degree (if any) of nerve damage.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsy {{monitoring}} {{is typically}} done to distinguish epileptic seizures from {{other types of}} spells, such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, syncope (fainting), sub-cortical movement disorders and migraine variants, to characterize seizures {{for the purposes of}} treatment, and to localize the region of brain from which a seizure originates for <b>work-up</b> of possible seizure surgery.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, the {{destroyer}} Kidd completed its two-week Independent Deployer Certification (IDCERT) exercises. Also, during that month, the Wayne E.

25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a <b>work-up</b> for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular <b>work-up.</b> Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} are asymptomatic or may have mild symptoms {{and not have}} clearly impaired clotting, which might suggest a bleeding disorder. Often, the discovery of vWD occurs incidentally to other medical procedures requiring a blood <b>work-up.</b> Most cases of type 1 vWD are never diagnosed due to the asymptomatic or mild presentation of type I and most people usually end up leading a normal life free of complications, with many being unaware {{that they have the}} disorder.|$|E
25|$|Chronic venous stasis {{changes can}} mimic early lymphedema, but {{the changes in}} venous stasis are more often {{bilateral}} and symmetric. Lipedema can also mimic lymphedema, however lipedema characteristically spares the feet beginning abruptly at the medial malleoli (ankle level). Lipedema is common in overweight women. As {{a part of the}} initial <b>work-up</b> before diagnosing lymphedema, {{it may be necessary to}} exclude other potential causes of lower extremity swelling such as renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, congestive heart-failure, protein-losing nephropathy, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, pregnancy and drug-induced edema.|$|E
