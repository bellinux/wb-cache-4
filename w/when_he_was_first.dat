5|$|Lennon {{started a}} skiffle {{group that was}} very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances. Some {{accounts}} credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{explained}} {{that he had to}} wait until the mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light & Magic during the post-production phase of Cocoon, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> approached by Lucas to direct Willow. He had previously starred in Lucas' American Graffiti, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a symbiotic relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob Dolman to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. Dolman had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called Little Shots that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical {{town hall}} built in 1841, {{eight years before}} Oldham {{received}} its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from {{the steps of the}} town hall <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure has stood empty since the mid-1980s and has regularly been earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none have been actioned.|$|E

5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{to reach the}} loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry with the decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt {{as he left the}} field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{developing}} the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around {{town in a}} caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did {{make it into the}} series, it was only used sparsely in early episodes. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

5000|$|Berthoald (or Bertoald) (died 604) was {{the mayor}} of the palace of Burgundy from some time before 603 (<b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> {{mentioned}} as mayor under King Theuderic II) until his death in the next year. According to the Burgundian chronicler Fredegar, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> moderate, sensible, brave, and honest.|$|R
5000|$|In features, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{very much}} a Farseer (his brother Shrewd {{especially}} resembled him in later life), although, it is noted, his eyes are a surprising green (most Farseer eyes <b>are</b> dark). <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> introduced, his life consists largely of a secret chamber, [...] "good food and wine, and a weasel for a companion", and secret missions for the King.|$|R
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
25|$|In April 1967, Warden was {{a member}} of the 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying the F4 Phantom II, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> {{deployed}} overseas to South Korea in response to the Pueblo incident.|$|E

50|$|This {{man was a}} {{war hero}} who was often {{accompanied}} by a dog and a horse. From the very beginning <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> introduced, <b>he</b> plays the game of hitting bottles off of posts with stones, displaying strength and perfect accuracy. This reflects Taffler's reputation in the war as a soldier who kills {{as though it were}} some kind of game.|$|R

5000|$|Yoshitane {{was the son}} of Ashikaga Yoshimi and {{grandson}} of the sixth shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori. In his early life, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> named Yoshiki (sometimes translated as Yoshimura), and then Yoshitada [...] - [...] including the period of <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> installed as shogun; however, he changed his name to Yoshitane in 1501 in a period <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> temporarily exiled, and it is by this name that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> generally known today.|$|R
2500|$|Cutbush {{must have}} begun {{playing in the}} 1730s, or earlier, when match details are scarce but by 1743, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> {{mentioned}} in contemporary reports, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> included among the six best players in England.

50|$|Marianus I (died after 18 March 1082) was the Judge of Logudoro from 1073, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> {{mentioned}} {{after his}} father or grandfather, Barisone I, until about 1082, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> last mentioned. His reign is obscure and the next judge mentioned is his son Constantine I in 1112, but to ascribe to Marianus a 39-year reign seems unnecessary {{and the presence of}} unknown other judges between Marianus and Constantine is likely.|$|R
25|$|More {{success in}} the Vizzy trophy in 1967 led to his {{selection}} in the Maharashtra Ranji team. Chauhan's first hundred came next year <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> in and last out against Bombay on a rain affected wicket where the first six wickets fell for 52. He scored 103 against South Zone in the Duleep Trophy final against five Test bowlers and was selected to play for India in 1969–70.|$|E
25|$|Shariff's {{popularity}} {{started to}} slide after 2001.

Shariff was defeated while Kang won his first term in office.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his two predecessors, Thant {{retired after}} ten years on {{speaking}} terms with all the big powers. In 1961, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> appointed, the Soviet Union tried to insist on a troika formula of three secretaries-general, one representing each Cold War bloc, to maintain equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed {{the importance of the}} secretary-generalship and his good offices, a clear tribute to Thant's work.|$|E

25|$|On 1 May 2009, Habib lost {{an appeal}} in the Full Federal Court against a 2007 Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) {{decision}} that affirmed the former Foreign Affairs minister's decision in 2006 to refuse him an Australian passport. The government had revoked his passport <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> returned to Australia {{and refused to}} issue him one in 2006. The AAT had concluded that Habib {{and his wife had}} given false evidence in the proceedings. They said that Habib still held the extremist sentiments that the government had understood he had held before 2001.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Sandusky, the adopted son of Jerry Sandusky, {{was also}} {{involved}} in lawsuits against Penn State. While Matthew Sandusky originally took his adopted father’s side <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> questioned by the grand jury, he later revealed that Jerry Sandusky had started to sexually abuse {{him when he was}} eight years old. The law firm of Ross Feller Casey LLP went on to represent him in the civil lawsuit, and Matthew Sandusky reached a settlement with Penn State University. He was among one of the 26 victims involved in the settlement amount that was reached in October 2013.|$|E
25|$|Captain White was {{a veteran}} of {{navigation}} on the upper Willamette River, and later became {{known as one of}} the most intrepid of all steamboat captains. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>first</b> assigned to the Wright, Captain White hung a square sail on the steamboat as a precaution in case of mechanical failure. When he took the Wright on her first trip up the Snake River, and when she hit a snag near the mouth of the Palouse River, she almost sank before Captain White could beach her. Bailed out and repaired, the Colonel Wright was able to continue her journey. White received a salary of $500 per month, a huge amount of money for the time, and retained the position for several years.|$|E

50|$|The {{movie was}} made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which uses a lion as its mascot. In fact, MGM even {{considered}} using their mascot {{for the role of}} the Cowardly Lion.
