He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together and working together means {{we can make a}} huge difference. We have been described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.|$|E

Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four years we have done a great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat." ...|$|E

Before the games Choden said that, [...] "Bhutan is just a small country of just 700,000. There {{is a lot of}} pressure on us but we must be realistic about our chances. We just want to do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event. She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. Now we can see how hard <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to be really good." ...|$|E
500|$|Minot's full NSI {{took place}} {{beginning}} on 17 May 2008, and {{was conducted by}} inspectors from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the USAF's Air Combat Command (ACC). On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base." [...] Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008.|$|E

At UNISA, we {{make every effort to}} service the different demands and needs of the scholarly community, as well as the general public through predominantly open access resources. The library acquires resources already developed in an e-environment, whilst the archives <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop digital resources of valuable and rare content. With this in mind, we knew that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together <b>to</b> develop a channel which is easy to access <b>to</b> provide the <b>needed</b> information at the exact right time and in a digestible format. This places a huge demand on the skills base and competencies and abilities that are required for this very dedicated and expensive resource development. Access to unique archival resources is a very important aspect in serving the cultural fabric of the community at large. With this presentation we will share what we consider to be important aspects to address in the working relationship between the library and the archives in reaching the user at the point and exact time of <b>needs.</b> <b>We</b> will touch on basic collaboration that was followed to digitise archival content and will briefly share some aspects that we had to consider in the outsourcing of digitisation of archival resources...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the methodology and the analysis tool developed for a study, {{carried out in}} 2012, aimed at the reorganisation of the interurban public transport services of the Piedmont region of Italy. Reorganization was necessary {{as a result of}} the reduction in funds allocated <b>to</b> public transport. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a large dataset spanning different types of data, such as service provision, ridership, economic data, and geographical information. The size of the task warranted the effort to merge all those data into a single database and develop an analysis tool on purpose. Therefore we custom built a web-based visual analysis tool, using free web applications, including geo-referenced dynamic maps and allowing users to visualise and interact readily with the information in the database. This web GIS application was used to characterise public transport lines on the basis of combinations of indicators of interest (such as ridership, number of services and km produced by time unit), or on the basis of their characteristics (such as route overlaps, reference public administration, type of services, e. g. daily, for schoolchildren, market day only). Tables, charts and maps obtained from the web GIS were employed to compare the information we had with a set of criteria and identify instances of inefficiency or ineffectiveness of interurban public transport services...|$|R
