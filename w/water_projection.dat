During development, show producers determined that the venue would need three screens to enable viewing along the entire waterfront. In addition to providing story development, the screens hide set changes. The pump house for the water screens and other fountain effects is located in the small structure along the river, just north of the Mark Twain dock. Water for the fountains is supplied via massive intake pipes directly under this structure. The fog system located around the banks of the river uses fresh water to create the fog effects along the river. The river's water itself is not suitable to be pumped through the mist nozzles, as aquashadow dye is added to the river to mask the bottom from guests.

40|$|A new {{statistical}} mechanics formulation of characterizing the structural fluctuation of protein correlated {{with that of}} water is presented based on the generalized Langevin equation and the 3 D-RISM/RISM theory of molecular liquids. The displacement vector of atom positions and their conjugated momentum, are chosen for the dynamic variables for protein, while the density fields of atoms and their momentum fields are chosen for <b>water.</b> <b>Projection</b> of other degrees of freedom onto those dynamic variables using the standard projection operator method produces essentially two equations which describe the time evolution of fluctuation concerning the density field of solvent and the conformation of protein around an equilibrium state, which are coupled with each other. The equation concerning the protein dynamics is formally akin {{to that of the}} coupled Langevin oscillators, and is a generalization of the latter, to atomic level. The most intriguing feature of the new equation is that it contains the variance-covariance matrix as the "Hessian" term describing the "force" restoring an equilibrium conformation, which is the second moment of the fluctuation of atom positions. The "Hessian" matrix is naturally identified as the second derivative of the free energy surface around the equilibrium. A method to evaluate the Hessian matrix based on the 3 D-RISM/RISM theory is proposed. Proposed also is an application of the present formulation to the molecular recognition, in which the conformational fluctuation of protein around its native state becomes an important factor as exemplified by so called "induced fitting".

Average surface <b>water</b> <b>projections</b> from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP 3) data are applied to surface water rights available to new generating capacity in ReEDS, and electric sector growth is compared with and without climate-influenced water rights. The mean climate projection has only a small impact on national or regional capacity growth and water use because most regions have sufficient unappropriated or previously retired water rights to offset climate impacts. Climate impacts are notable in southwestern states, which experience reduced water rights purchases and a greater share of rights acquired from wastewater and other higher-cost water resources.

40|$|Future {{environmental}} change {{is expected to}} modify the global hydrological cycle, with consequences for the regional distribution of freshwater supplies. Regional precipitation projections, however, differ largely between models, making future <b>water</b> resource <b>projections</b> highly uncertain. Using two representative concentration pathways and nine climate models, we estimate 21 st century water resources across Australia, employing both a process-based dynamic vegetation model and a simple hydrological framework commonly used in water resource studies to separate the effects of climate and vegetation on water resources. We show surprisingly robust, pathway-independent regional patterns of change in water resources despite large uncertainties in precipitation <b>projections.</b> Increasing plant <b>water</b> use efficiency (due to the changing atmospheric CO 2) and reduced green vegetation cover (due to the changing climate) relieve pressure on water resources for the highly populated, humid coastal regions of eastern Australia. By contrast, in semi-arid regions across Australia, runoff declines are amplified by CO 2 -induced greening, which leads to increased vegetation water use. These findings highlight the importance of including vegetation dynamics in future <b>water</b> resource <b>projections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Symptoms {{of chronic}} rhinosinusitis (CRS) are nasal blockage, nasal discharge, postnasal drip, facial pain, headache, and {{reduction}} {{or loss of}} smell, but they are often subtle and {{make it difficult to}} obtain a firm diagnosis based only on clinical data, and especially to distinguish CRS from persistent rhinitis. A. diagnosis of certainty of CRS relies upon either direct observation by nasal fibroendoscopy of nasal turbinates, middle meatus, and rhinopharynx, detecting mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus, and/or oedema or mucosal obstruction, or by imaging of the rhinosinusal cavities. Imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance (MR) are currently recommended in consensus documents, while plain radiography is considered of poor diagnostic value.

MethodsWe enrolled 60 atopic children with acute sinusitis, of whom 29 received nasal irrigation with normal saline and 31 did not receive nasal irrigation. All participants underwent a nasal peak expiratory flow rate (nPEFR) test, a nasal smear examination, and radiography (<b>Water's</b> <b>projection)</b> and were requested to complete a Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (PRQLQ) during the baseline visit. All participants were requested to record symptoms in a daily diary and were followed up at 1 -week intervals. A physical examination, nasal smear, and nPEFR were performed at each visit, and all daily diaries were collected. At the final visit (after 3 weeks), the symptom diaries were reviewed and participants were requested to complete the PRQLQ again. nPEFR, radiography, and a nasal smear were also repeated. ResultsThere were significant improvements in mean PRQLQ and nPEFR values (p    0. 05).

The Water Futures and Solution initiative (WFaS) has developed a set of global water-use scenarios consistent with the recent Assessment Report framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, notably the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and applying a hydro-economic classification that links a socioeconomic dimension with hydrologic complexity. Here we present regional <b>water</b> use <b>projections</b> for the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China consistent with the WFaS global assessment. Using two different downscaling techniques for developing regional water-use scenarios based on the national assumptions made for China in the WFaS assessment, we investigate PRD’s water-use projections. The findings indicate {{significant differences in the}} PRD’s regional development trends compared to China’s national SSP. The regionalized scenarios project lower water use because of the PRD’s lower share of the manufacturing sector in total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and higher rates of technological improvement, compared to national development trend assumptions. Nevertheless, hydrological challenges remain for the PRD. Its total water use would still increase by up to 54 % in 2030 under the regionalized scenarios. Although uncertainties related to scarce data remain, we provide a scientifically sound and feasible method to generate regional scenarios that can capture the regional sectorial water uses development as well as being consistent with national water-use scenarios developed by global assessment...|$|R

40|$|To sustain growing {{food demand}} and {{increasing}} standard of living, global water use increased by nearly 6 {{times during the}} last 100 years and continues to grow. As water demands get {{closer and closer to}} the water availability in many regions, each drop of water becomes increasingly valuable and water must be managed more efficiently and intensively. Howevr, soaring water use worsens water scarcity condition already prevalent in semi-arid and arid regions, increasing uncertainty for unstainable food production and economic development. Planning for future development and investments requires that we prepare <b>water</b> <b>projections</b> for the future. However, estimations are complicated because the future of world's waters will be influenced by a combination of environmental, social, economic, and political factors, and there is only limited knowledge and data available about freshwaer resources and how they are being used.

This thesis describes changes to surface water availability in Tasmania for the 21 st century assessed {{from a series of}} high-resolution regional climate and hydrological models. Surface <b>water</b> <b>projections</b> are generated by bias-correcting regional climate model (RCM) simulations, passing the bias-corrected RCM simulations through rainfall-runoff models, and then passing runoff through river models that simulate water diversions and consumption. The bias-correction applied to daily RCM simulations is a quantile mapping technique that aligns empirical frequency distributions of RCM variables to observations. We show that quantile mapping of empirical distributions can be highly effective in correcting biases in RCM outputs. Cross-validation shows biases are effectively reduced across the range of cumulative frequency distributions, with few exceptions. The bias-correction is not as effective at correcting biases for values at or near zero (e. g. in rainfall simulations), although even here the bias-correction improves biases in the uncorrected simulations. In addition, the bias-correction improves frequency characteristics of variables such as the number of rain days. The bias-correction effectively preserves long-term changes (e. g. to the mean and variance) to variables projected by the uncorrected RCM simulations. Correlations between key variables are also largely preserved, thus the bias-corrected outputs largely reflect the dynamics of the underlying RCM. However, the bias-corrected simulations still exhibit some of the deficiencies of the RCM simulations, for example the tendency to underestimate both the magnitude and duration of large, multi-day rain events. Bias-corrected outputs from six fine-scale (10 km 2) simulations of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration generated with the CSIRO Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM), a variable-resolution RCM, are used as direct inputs to the hydrological models AWBM, IHACRES, Sacramento, SIMHYD and SMAR-G to project Tasmanian runoff.
