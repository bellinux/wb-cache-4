5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be retained, so they {{assigned}} {{it to be a}} target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, at 62, {{felt she}} <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> travel to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited {{on her behalf}} and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> play {{an active part in}} the war. For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E

5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started Jim <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> {{be called}} up for active service, {{as well as}} having {{previously}} been disqualified on medical grounds after falling from a wall and smashing his left eardrum when 10 years old. After the cotton exchange closed {{for the duration of}} the war, Jim worked as an inspector at Napier's engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives. He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's Cleansing Department before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E

5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E

25|$|Hearne {{continued}} to play up to 1914 – though without the same success of 1910 and 1911 – taking his three thousandth wicket {{on the first day}} of 1914. When first-class cricket resumed in 1919, Hearne was fifty-two and clearly <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> play a full season's cricket. He played two more first-class matches against weak opponents in 1921 and 1923, but never again in the Championship.|$|E
