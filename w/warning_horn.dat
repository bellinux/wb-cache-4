25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E
500|$|Manchester Metrolink {{has many}} tramway sections, along which trams share the highway with other road traffic and pedestrians. Trams are {{equipped}} with a two-tone standard horn and a louder <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> which is primarily intended for use on former railway routes but can be used anywhere.

50|$|The aircraft's Take-off <b>warning</b> system <b>horn</b> was {{not heard}} on the CAM channel of the CVR. It is {{possible}} that the take-off configuration warning was not sounding.|$|R
50|$|Devices to {{warn the}} pilot when the aircraft's speed is {{decreasing}} close to the stall speed include stall <b>warning</b> <b>horns</b> (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings. Most stalls {{are a result of}} the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{without an}} instant's <b>warning,</b> von <b>Horn</b> drew his gun, wheeled, and fired point-blank, first {{at one of}} his companions, then at the other. Both men fell in their tracks, and {{scarcely}} had the pungent odor of the powder smoke reached Bulan's nostrils ere the white man had plunged into the jungle and disappeared.|$|R
500|$|Seconds after {{take off}} from Heathrow's then [...] long runway 28L (now [...] long and {{designated}} 27L), there was an unexpected bang and the aircraft started vibrating. The throttle controlling number two engine was shutting down. While Captain Taylor ordered an engine failure drill, Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks carried out the engine failure drill, but both he and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss reached for the switch to cancel the undercarriage <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> At the same time, First Officer Francis Kirkland inadvertently cancelled the fire bell. Hicks reached for, but didn't pull, the engine fire shut-off handle. Moss, observing the fire, exclaimed [...] "Bloody hell! The wing's on fire!" [...] A Mayday was broadcast at 15:29.|$|E
500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (SPADs) were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry song [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (from {{the album}} The Mind Is a Terrible Thing To Taste) {{features}} an audio {{sample of the}} military station's <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> and a few notes of composer John Harrison's synthesized score.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic <b>warning</b> deer <b>horns</b> can {{be mounted}} on {{vehicles}} to warn deer of approaching automobiles, though their effectiveness is disputed. Ultrasonic wind-driven whistles are often promoted as a cheap, {{simple way to}} reduce the chance of wildlife-vehicle collisions. In one study, the sound pressure level of the whistle was 3 dB above the sound pressure level of the test vehicle, but caused no observable difference in behavior of animals when the whistles were activated and not activated, casting doubt on their effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|Residents of an {{affected}} community {{might be}} informed that shelter in place is being implemented through the news media, Emergency Alert System, Reverse 911, <b>warning</b> sirens or <b>horns,</b> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports, and announcements from {{vehicles equipped with}} public address systems. In the United States, facilities like nuclear power plants are required to be equipped with audio alert systems that can be heard within a 10 mi radius.|$|R
50|$|When {{the distant}} signal is at 'caution' or yellow (on), the {{electro-magnet}} is de-energised. As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. However, since the electro-magnet is de-energised, {{the system is}} not reset. After the one-second delay within which the system can be reset, a <b>horn</b> <b>warning</b> is given until the driver acknowledges by pressing a plunger. If the driver fails to acknowledge the warning within 2.75 seconds, the brakes are automatically applied. If the driver does acknowledge the warning, the indicator disk changes to yellow and black, to remind the driver that he has acknowledged a warning. The yellow and black indication persists until the next signal and serves as a reminder between signals that the driver is proceeding under caution. The one-second delay before the horn sounds allows the system to operate correctly down to speeds as low as 1.75 miles per hour. Below this speed, the caution <b>horn</b> <b>warning</b> will always be given, but it will be automatically cancelled when the electromagnet resets the system if the driver has not already done so. The display will indicate all black once the system resets.|$|R
2500|$|The Boeing 727-251, {{registration}} N274US, departed New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 19:14 for a {{ferry flight}} to Buffalo. As the craft climbed past , the overspeed <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded, followed 10 seconds later by a stick shaker stall warning. The aircraft leveled at [...] until {{it started to}} descend {{out of control in}} a spin, reaching a vertical acceleration of +5g until it struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing-down attitude twelve minutes after take-off, at 19:26.|$|E
2500|$|At 16:10:24 (114 seconds), the leading-edge {{devices were}} {{selected}} to be retracted at a height above the ground of [...] and a speed of , [...] below the safe droop-retraction speed of [...] One second afterwards, visual and audible warnings of a stall activated on the flight deck, followed at 16:10:26 hrs (116 seconds) by a stick shake and at 16:10:27hrs (117 seconds) by a stick push which disconnected the autopilot, in turn activating a loud autopilot disconnect <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> that continued to sound {{for the remainder of}} the flight. Key levelled the wings but held the aircraft's nose up, which kept the angle of attack high, further approaching a stall.|$|E
2500|$|The stall {{characteristics}} are also relatively benign, being described by Flight International as [...] "probably the most docile of any aircraft I can remember". On the DA42, stall conditions are forewarned by the sounding of a <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> at 5-7kt above stall, {{as well as}} by elevating levels of airframe buffeting and a 5–10° drop of the nose. The aircraft is relatively difficult to stall outside of substantial mishandling or deliberate intention. Both longitudinal and lateral stability can be maintained with a relatively low level of effort, not necessitating continuous trimming while the aircraft is accelerating. Active use of the rudder is necessary for effective turns and counteracting sideslip tendencies.|$|E

60|$|A Zeppelin warning, a {{few hours}} before, had driven the people to their homes. There was not a chink of light to be seen anywhere. An intense and gloomy stillness seemed to brood over the deserted thoroughfares. Nightbirds {{on their way home}} flitted by like shadows. Policemen lurked {{in the shadows of the}} houses. The few {{vehicles}} left crawled about with insufficient lights. Even the <b>warning</b> <b>horns</b> of the taxicab men sounded furtive and repressed. Lessingham, as he marched stolidly along, felt curiously in sympathy with his environment. Hayter's news brought him face to face with that inner problem which had so suddenly become the dominant factor in his life. For the first time he knew what love was. He felt the wonder of it, the far-reaching possibilities, the strange idealism called so unexpectedly into being. He recognized the vagaries of Philippa's disposition, and yet, during the last few days, he had convinced himself that she was beginning to care. Her strained relations with her husband had been, without a doubt, her first incentive towards the acceptance of his proffered devotion. Now he told himself with eager hopefulness that some portion of it, however minute, must be for his own sake. The relations between husband and wife, he reminded himself, must, at any rate, have been strained during the last few months, or Cranston would never have been able to keep his secret. In his gloomy passage through this land of ill omens, however, he shivered a little as he thought of the other possibility--tortured himself with imagining what might happen during her revulsion of feeling, if Philippa discovered the truth. A sense of something greater than he had yet known in life seemed to lift him into some lofty state of aloofness, from which he could look down and despise himself, the poor, tired plodder wearing the heavy chains of duty. There was a life so much more wonderful, just the other side of the clouds, a very short distance away, a life of alluring and passionate happiness. Should he ever find the courage, he wondered, to escape from the treadmill and go in search of it? Duty, for the last two years, had taken him by the hand and led him along a pathway of shame. He had never been a hypocrite about the war. He was one of those who had acknowledged from the first that Germany had set forth, with the sword in her hand, on a war of conquest. His own inherited martial spirit had vaguely approved; he, too, in those earlier days, had felt the sunlight upon his rapier. Later had come the enlightenment, the turbulent waves of doubt, the nightmare of a nation's awakening conscience, mirrored in his own soul. It was in a depression shared, perhaps, in a lesser degree by millions of those whose ranks he had joined, that he felt this passionate craving for escape into a world which took count of other things.|$|R
40|$|El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related {{anomalies}} {{were analyzed}} {{using a combination of}} satellite measurements of elevated sea surface temperatures, and subsequent elevated rainfall and satellite derived normalized difference vegetation index data. A Rift Valley fever risk mapping model using these climate data predicted areas where outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in humans and animals were expected and occurred in the Horn of Africa from December 2006 to May 2007. The predictions were subsequently confirmed by entomological and epidemiological field investigations of virus activity in the areas identified as at risk. Accurate spatial and temporal predictions of disease activity, as it occurred first in southern Somalia and then through much of Kenya before affecting northern Tanzania, provided a 2 to 6 week period of <b>warning</b> for the <b>Horn</b> of Africa that facilitated disease outbreak response and mitigation activities.

40|$|AbstractThe term of concept {{which can}} be defined as the projection/abstract design of one idea, event, emotion or object formed in the human mind, is a name given to a general {{classification}} for grouping the abstract-sounding words that we often encounter with or hear in our daily lives. Concept {{is directly related to the}} individual's ability of perception and responding to an influence. In the scope of this study, we can see the subject of the imagination/visualization/illustration of the concepts considering the perception and imagination of children and also it is examined if the illustrations in the children's books or the visual materials that are used in children's education are overlapping with the imagination of the children. Sounds as the complementary formations of the nature {{can be defined as}} a messenger when appropriate and also as the waves that are triggering the feelings when needed. It is planned to organize a workshop with students consisting of different age groups in order to explain the differences in the perception among people. In the beginning of the workshop some concepts that define the sounds are determined (wind, noise, <b>horn,</b> <b>warning,</b> ringing, music, and yelling, speaking, siren). These concepts of sounds are selected from the sounds that are often heard in the everyday life. It is planned to visualize these defined concepts as sound cards and illustrate each sound separately. The aim of this study is to reveal that the defined sound concepts are perceived differently from each child...|$|R
40|$|AbstractForward Collision Warning (FCW) {{systems are}} {{intended}} to alert drivers to an imminent forward collision threat to reduce the frequency and severity of rear-end collisions and mitigate injury and property damage for occupants of both vehicles. This between-subjects driving simulator study {{examined the effects of}} three variables – FCW system training, auditory warning type, and gender – on a visually distracted driver's response to an unexpected, imminent, forward collision threat. First, only half of the participants were provided with {{a brief description of the}} FCW system. Second, four different auditory warning conditions were compared: no-auditory warning (baseline), average-urgency warning, highest-urgency warning, and an auditory icon car horn. Drivers who received FCW system training had faster reaction times and 68 % fewer collisions than drivers who did not receive training. While the highest-urgency warning produced the fastest initial glance to the forward scene, it was the car <b>horn</b> <b>warning</b> that produced robust reaction time, glance behavior, and collision benefits. Unexpectedly, 34. 7 % of distracted drivers glanced back to the center console display, following their initial forward glance, prior to braking. This unanticipated behavior resulted in longer reaction times, shorter minimum time-to-collision, and a 63. 7 % increase in collisions as compared with drivers who did not glance back to the console display. Results suggest that even brief system training can aid interaction with an FCW system and glance behavior, reaction times can improve with an auditory icon car horn as the auditory warning, and that uninterrupted forward attention upon detection of a collision threat is imperative for an effective collision avoidance response...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a driving simulator study on driving {{behavior in a}} critical head-on collision scenario. The study aims at providing basic understanding of driver responses to headlight and <b>horn</b> <b>warning</b> coming from another vehicle a time critical situation. In total, 48 participants drove 30 km. During the drive participants performed a secondary task, announced by a vibration in the seat. At {{the time of the}} secondary task the own vehicle was directed into the opposing lane where oncoming simulated vehicles issued a light and/or sound warnings to get the drivers attention. An additional {{purpose of the study was}} to examine if the warning coming from the other vehicle has a different effect on persons with a hearing loss. A possible application for this type of warnings is the implementation of a system for automatic activation. Systems for automatic activation of brakes and steering are currently entering the market. These systems use proximity sensors to monitor the state of surrounding road users. Depending on the specific situation the effort/possibility to avoid or mitigate an accident may differ significantly between the principle road users of a pending collision, e. g. one road user (1) may easily avoid a collision while another (2) may not be able to do so. The only possibility for the second road user (2) to avoid a collision in such a situation is to issue a warning to the first (1), so that he/she may take evasive actions. Connecting the horn and the headlight to already existing sensor system, for automatic warning activation, is a cost effective means to provide such a warning. The warnings, could of course, also be triggered manually by the driver. The results indicate that a driver who receives a warning from the oncoming vehicle responds faster to avoid the pending frontal collision. The most effective warning was the combination of horn and headlight. A majority of the participants where positive to the notion of an automated system to provide this type of warning (n= 41). No significant difference in the behavior between the groups with and without hearing loss was found in this study. Principal other vehicle warnin...|$|R

5000|$|On 14 January 1970, an Aspen Airways Convair CV-240-12 (registration N270L) {{landed on}} the runway with its landing gear raised.

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, the pressure inside the cabin gradually decreased. As it passed through {{an altitude of}} 12040 ft, the cabin altitude <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> sounded.

This took place during bad weather conditions similar to the 1995 incident.|$|E
5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible warning as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn,</b> which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an audible warning in response.|$|E
50|$|All {{aircraft}} with retractable {{landing gear}} are required to {{have a way to}} indicate the status of the landing gear, which is normally a set of lights that change colors from red to amber to green depending on whether the gear are up, in transit, or down. However, a distracted pilot may forget to look at these lights. This has led to aircraft designers building extra safety systems in the aircraft to reduce the possibility of human error. In small aircraft this most commonly {{takes the form of a}} warning light and horn which operate when any of the landing gear is not locked down and any of the engine throttles are retarded below a cruise power setting. However, the horn has been useless in situations when the pilot was unfamiliar with the aircraft and did not know what the horn sounding was meant to indicate. Pilots have sometimes confused the landing gear <b>warning</b> <b>horn</b> with the stall <b>warning</b> <b>horn.</b> In other cases, pilots cannot hear the horn on older aircraft due to wearing a modern noise-canceling headset.|$|E
