25|$|Some {{view the}} three-age system as over-simple; that is, it neglects vital detail and forces complex {{circumstances}} into a mold {{they do not}} fit. Rowlands argues that the division of human societies into epochs based on the presumption of a single set of related changes is not realistic:But as a more rigorous sociological approach has begun to show that changes at the economic, political and ideological levels are not 'all of apiece' <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to realise that time may be segmented in as many ways as convenient to the researcher concerned.|$|E

500|$|The Harrow & The Harvest was {{released}} on June 28, 2011. [...] Welch attributed the long time period between releases to dissatisfaction with the songs they were writing. [...] She explained: [...] "Our songcraft slipped and I really don't know why. It's not uncommon. It's something that happens to writers. It's the deepest frustration <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> through, hence the album title." [...] The writing process involved [...] "this endless {{back and forth between}} the two of us," [...] Welch said, stating that [...] "It’s our most intertwined, co-authored, jointly-composed album." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> so far? ... Would <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{was a great}} {{showcase}} for not only each of the characters, but the setting of Pawnee as well, and that the episode [...] "illustrated each part of Pawnee that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to know and love so much". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix had the [...] "both the scope and the out-of-control but not frantic style" [...] of [...] "The Harvest Festival". He also enjoyed the scene with Leslie and Ben, and said he believed the show could get great [...] "comic mileage" [...] out of their continued secret relationship together. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin called the episode a [...] "tour de force that expertly wrapped up an excellent season". Garrett said the show's characters were [...] "so vivid and instantly memorable" [...] that the death of Li'l Sebastian really felt like a major event, {{even though he had}} only previously appeared in one other episode. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also enjoyed seeing Tom succeed with his concert, and claimed the Li'l Sebastian funeral scene was surprisingly powerful.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two called the entry [...] "an {{exercise}} in futility [...] at best" [...] and argued that, because Duchovny had left the series, the sense of excitement {{that he might have}} made an appearance in the episode was completely gone. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson heavily criticized Mulder and Scully's characterization, calling Mulder a character the audience [...] "can't recognize any more" [...] and Scully a [...] "gullible patsy". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, was also critical of the script's treatment of the characters, arguing that Mulder and Scully in this episode [...] "sound nothing like the characters <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to know". He also lamented that the episode did not examine the central theme of electronic surveillance in greater detail. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode. He derided the series for making it appear that Mulder abandoned the woman he loved and his own child. He noted, [...] "Just because it walks, talks, and sometimes acts like The X-Files, doesn't make it The X-Files." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's humour {{was praised}} by the {{majority}} of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers [...] "managed to pull together a loving tribute to [...] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that [...] "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including [...] "anachronistic references" [...] and [...] "dark punnery", were [...] "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several [...] "inspired moments", including a [...] "perfectly pitched" [...] joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it [...] "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode [...] "fell some way short of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was [...] "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed [...] "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode [...] "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" [...] after the conclusion of the series.|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} how <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some {{might seem to be}} [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The World Is Not Enough" [...] {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kerrang! magazine noted that [...] "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever-burgeoning celebrity {{will be done}} no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem." [...] A Radio Times reviewer wrote that the song [...] "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited", while AllMusic's Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage [...] "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song". PopMatters called the song a [...] "top-notch Bond theme", following the Shirley Bassey template. In a Billboard review, Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song [...] "rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to expect... the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint. [...] not only the best 007 theme in eons, {{it is a great}} Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike". IGN ranked [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs: [...] "Shirley Manson's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's sweeping symphonics." ...|$|E
500|$|Lutyens' [...] {{memorial}} in Ayscoughfee Hall gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, {{at the south}} end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower—a 19th-century folly known as the [...] "Owl Tower". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by Reverend Alfred Jarvis, Assistant Chaplain-General to Northern Command. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a [...] "symbol of oblivion". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was the war to end war, he told the assembled: [...] "The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked in our minds with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia , India, and Egypt are straining at the leash of civilisation." [...] The general concluded: [...] "If you want to end war, you must end hatred" [...] and that [...] "In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will be doing in our own small way our best each of us—and Spalding minds united are a great force—and in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> here to commemorate". At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the [...] "Last Post" [...] and the crowd sang the national anthem, after which the dignitaries—including McLaren and her sons—laid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance.|$|E
