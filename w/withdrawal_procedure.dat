5000|$|The UK's {{membership}} of the European Economic Community, later the European Union, from 1973: The EU represents, as the European Court of Justice ruled in 1963 in the case Van Gend en Loos, a [...] "new legal order of international law {{for the benefit of}} which the Member States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields". The UK became part of that legal order, though as UK {{membership of}} the EU has been brought about through Acts of Parliament - principally the European Communities Act 1972 - Parliament could, as a matter of UK law, pass further legislation unilaterally withdrawing the UK from the Union, or selectively barring the application of European law within the UK. The European Union Act 2011 reaffirmed that sovereignty lay with the British Parliament, with section 18 stating: [...] "Directly applicable or directly effective EU law (that is, the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures referred to in section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972) falls to be recognized and available in law in the United Kingdom only by virtue of that Act or where it is required to be recognised and available in law by virtue of any other Act." [...] The Act also requires that a referendum be held when more powers are transferred to the European Union (though this can be repealed with another Act of Parliament). Alternatively, as prescribed by the 2016 Brexit referendum, an Act to withdraw from the European Union could be passed in parallel with the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>procedure</b> laid down in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, whereby a Member State would notify the European Council of its intention to secede from the Union and a withdrawal agreement would be negotiated between the Union and the State.

5000|$|In April 2012, {{three months}} before Carromero {{travelled}} to Cuba, the Spanish Directorate General of Traffic had initiated the administrative process of revoking his driver's license and issued the due public notice on May 18. The withdrawal did not take effect until after the process was completed and the official withdrawal notice was published on August 9, 2012. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>procedure</b> was the consequence of two traffic offenses since Carromero had acquired his license: A speeding violation from August 18, 2009 cost him 6 of his 8 total credit points as a novice driver under the Spanish points system, before he finally lost the remaining points for a single offense of speaking with a mobile phone in his hand while driving. The speeding ticket was for riding at 145 km/h on the Madrid-Valencia motorway with a speed limit of 120 km/h. The fine was aggravated by the fact that, as a novel driver in his second year, Carromero was to keep below a general maximum speed of 90 km/h. Carromero's driving record was incorrectly reported by various Spanish media starting in early August 2012 while he was held in solitary confinement in a cell at the [...] "100 y Aldabó" [...] police headquarters in Havana awaiting trial. Some newspaper reports claimed he had already lost his licence {{as a consequence of}} various instances of careless driving. His mother in Madrid immediately appealed to the media in an open letter, stating her son's licence was still valid, and asking journalists to refrain from publishing speculative and incorrect information or from investigating confidential private data, and urging the media to use prudence, respect and responsibility. Various media reports mentioned a total of over 40 traffic fines since 2009, without stating that public documentation only existed for parking tickets which were of no relevance to the status of his driver's licence. His friends, according to various news media, described him as being [...] "the very figure of Prudence when {{behind the wheel of a}} car." [...] According to statements to media by his friend, head of Nuevas Generaciones for Madrid and MP Pablo Casado, after visiting Carromero in jail a few days after his return from Cuba, Carromero was considering asking for a formal investigation into who had leaked the information about his traffic fines including confidential data to the press. Casado underlined that of the 45 reported fines, 43 were parking tickets, and that Carromero had lost the credit points of his driving licence for a single incident of speeding in 2009 and a later incident of talking on his mobile phone. According to Casado, Carromero also wanted to know to what end the information was leaked and explained that it had had the effect of complicating his judicial process in Cuba after the Cuban authorities had become aware of the reports published in Spain and based their prosecution on his alleged record of reckless driving. The question of how and why various media, including reputable newspapers such as El País and El Mundo, had claimed various speeding offenses was not resolved.|$|E

Secession (from States) and withdrawal (from international organisations) is always possible de facto: the relevant question is whether constitutional provisions ensure an orderly secession and discourage casual recourse thereto.

40|$|The opiate {{withdrawal}} syndrome powerfully motivates opiate seeking and abuse. Development of effective medications for opiate withdrawal symptoms {{is thus a}} primary research goal and heavily relies on improved experimental models. This study was carried out to establish a clinically relevant paradigm to assess somatic opiate withdrawal in mice. Female and male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were treated with saline or increasing morphine doses (10 - 50 mg/kg or 20 - 100 mg/kg) during 6 consecutive days and tested for the spontaneous expression of somatic opiate withdrawal signs 8, 32, 56 and 80 h after last drug administration. Contrary to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated procedures, the spontaneous opiate withdrawal paradigm used here revealed interesting gender- and morphine dose-linked differences. In particular, 56 h after last morphine administration elevated global opiate withdrawal scores were still evident in female but not in male mice treated with 20 - 100 mg/kg. The severity of somatic opiate withdrawal directly correlated with the prior cumulative morphine exposure. Timing of expression of somatic opiate withdrawal signs also varied {{as a function of}} both gender and morphine dose. For example, expression of paw tremors and wet dog shakes was earlier in opiate-withdrawn male than in female mice. Overall, these findings highlight the possibility to detect gender- and opiate dose-linked differences in the expression and duration of somatic opiate withdrawal using a clinically relevant research model. The behavioral paradigm described here may represent a more appropriate tool to investigate the neurobiological bases of opiate withdrawal as opposed to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated opiate <b>withdrawal</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Migraine is {{a serious}} illness with a {{spontaneous}} clinical evolution into a chronic form. In some episodic migraines, increase of crises frequency modifies the headache pattern in the chronic form, defined as chronic migraine (CM), with headache frequency of 15 days/month. One-year prevalence of CM includes around 2 - 4 % of the general population. Migraine progression from episodic to chronic form is realized {{through a period of}} time involving several months or years, during which an increase of attack frequency occurs. Migraine shows a wide spectrum of comorbidities, including cardiocerebral, vascular, psychiatric, metabolic, neurologic as well as other pathologies. The single/multiple presence of such comorbidities represents a fixed factor in the process of chronicization into CM. Risk factors including medication overuse headache (MOH), obesity, and lifestyle cooperate in the evolution process to CM. MOH is the most severe complication of CM, and similarly to CM its appearance is gradual. Both CM and MOH show particular genetic background able to favor the appearance of chronicity and abuse. Rehabilitation consists of drug <b>withdrawal</b> <b>procedures,</b> re-prophylaxis through administration of innovative drugs, such as OnabotulinumtoxinA and/or topiramate, to avoid relapsing attacks, and behavioral strategies to minimize the role of risk factors.

Physicians’ unwillingness to withdraw life-sustaining therapy has been previously associated with religion, culture, experience, and gender [14, 33 – 37]. Rather than focusing on differences between centers, our study aimed to identify the conditions that specifically led to withdraw and/or withhold therapy.

The fact is that, on average, half of the class will have fallen by the wayside. 2 ̆ 2 This study is not an attempt to set down the reasosn for the student mortality at the Utah State Agricultural College. A survey of available data revealed that the variables encountered would reduce that segment of the study to a matter of speculation and therefore the reasons for withdrawal are not an aspect of this study. The only information availalbe concerning reasons for discontinuing college is a brief statement made by those students who actually completed formal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>procedures.</b> The writer found {{that a majority of}} students who discontinued college did so {{at the end of a}} quarter or at the end of the regular school year, and therefore did not file withdrawal statements. This study concerns a select group of students who were assembled for freshmand registration. What happened to the group between the beginning of the freshman year 1946 and commencement day 1950 is the problem projected. The period 1946 to 1950 is not necessarily typical of the history of higher education. Many students, veterans of World War II, had enrolled at the College under the privileges afforded them in Public Laws 16 and 346. It would be safe to say that a number of students in this study would not have enrolled in college had not the G. I. educational benefits been made available to them. As a matter of fact, a significant perentage of students indicated to the writer that the 2 ̆ 2 G. I. Bill of Rights 2 ̆ 2 was the foremost reason for enrollment. While 787 cases in the study are veterans, 510 cases are not veterans. The writer does believe that he has a representative sampling of College students of this particular period and therefore went forward with the problem...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT When resting {{commercial}} laying hens, {{a system}} of minimum length that yields an acceptable increase in egg shell quality {{as soon as possible}} after force resting is desirable. In each of three experiments, a treatment that utilized a 4 -day feed withdrawal period was compared with a control or an acceptable conventional method. Feed was withdrawn for 96 hr after which the birds were returned to the diets being consumed before the rest period was initiated. Other management practices, such as providing water ad libitum and the use of lights, were continued without in-terruption. Egg specific gravities for birds subjected to the 4 -day rest were significantly improved over those recorded for eggs laid by control hens and were comparable to those obtained from a con-ventional (10 -day feed <b>withdrawal)</b> rest <b>procedure.</b> Short rest birds returned to production much sooner than birds rested by the 10 -day feed withdrawal and 25 -day recovery procedure. Those hens subjected to the short rest procedure had egg production and egg weights comparable to those obtained or anticipated from other resting methods and values generally superior to those obtained with the control (no rest) treatment. (Key words: laying hens, 4 -day rest, egg production, egg shell quality...|$|R
