5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing any of this, Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> her husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E
25|$|Some animals may use {{tactical}} deception, with behaviour that is {{deployed in}} a way that other animals misinterpret <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> the advantage of the agent. Some of the evidence for this is anecdotal, but in the great apes in particular, experimental studies in ethology suggest that deception is actively practised by some animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} HIV also {{encourages}} {{a cycle of}} blame and violence, which marginalises and encourages violence against a gay lifestyle. This cycle takes on further meaning under Jamaican law, which criminalises all anal sex and often turns {{a blind eye to}} violence against homosexuals. Few are willing to take up the language of human rights against <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> homosexuals and HIV positive individuals because they are considered responsible for the spread of HIV.|$|E

25|$|While one Days follows their Lord, their {{counterpart}} {{lives in}} a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes from knowing that {{at any given time}} they can find out <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference – {{even in the face of}} cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single drowning person. Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies.|$|E

500|$|During a {{space flight}} to Saturn, three astronauts {{are exposed to}} a blast of {{radiation}} which kills {{two of them and}} seriously injures the third, Colonel Steve West (Rebar). He is next shown unconscious in a hospital back on Earth, with bandages covering his face; his physician, Dr. Loring (Lisle Wilson), cannot explain <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> West or how he survived the blast. After the doctor leaves, West awakens and is horrified to find the flesh on his face and hands melting away. Hysterical, he attacks and kills a nurse (Bonnie Inch), then escapes the hospital in a panic. Loring and Dr. Theodore [...] "Ted" [...] Nelson (DeBenning), a scientist and friend of West, discover that the nurse's corpse is emitting feeble radiation, and realize West's body has become radioactive. Nelson believes West has gone insane, and concludes he must consume human flesh in order to slow the melting. Nelson calls General Michael Perry (Healey), a United States Air Force officer familiar with West's accident, and the general agrees to help Nelson find him.|$|E

Soon, while being transferred to a safe house, Ruth is captured and brought to Harry, while George and Nico are taken to the safe house unaware of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> <b>To</b> save them, Ruth reveals the uranium is at a base in Norfolk, however Mani reveals he searched the base and it is no longer there, and hence orders George's execution.|$|E

500|$|Michael Britten, {{a detective}} with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), {{and his family}} are {{involved}} in a car accident. After the crash, Michael is confronted with two separate realities. His wife Hannah has (apparently) survived the accident; however, in a second [...] "reality", his son Rex survives instead. To distinguish the two realities for the viewer, Michael wears a red wristband in the first reality and a green one in the second. Michael does not know which [...] "reality" [...] is real; he has therapy sessions with Dr. Jonathan Lee in the [...] "red reality" [...] and Dr. Judith Evans in the [...] "green", both of whom attempt to diagnose <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> Michael. Each therapist sees it as a coping mechanism, insisting that the other reality is a dream. Dr. Lee is confrontational about the accident, while Dr. Evans is more nurturing. In the [...] "red reality" [...] Hannah plans to move to Portland, Oregon, but later decides against it (partly due to Michael's objections).|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E
