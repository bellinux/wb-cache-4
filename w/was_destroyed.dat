5|$|Augustine built {{a church}} at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church <b>was</b> <b>destroyed</b> after the Norman Conquest {{to make way}} for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that <b>was</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory <b>was</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church <b>was</b> <b>destroyed</b> by fire and in another claiming only that it was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building <b>was</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.|$|E
