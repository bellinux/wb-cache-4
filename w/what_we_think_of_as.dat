2500|$|The Cuban-born {{art critic}} Ricardo Pau-Llosa {{was an early}} champion, writing: [...] "Ojeda's works, from the onset of his arrival in {{professional}} art circles two years ago, possess an assured, subterranean, yet overpowering spirit of importance. His work is unsettling because, in some mysterious way, beneath the shell of what seems [...] "safe" [...] themes and subject matter, lies an instinctive and intuitive sense of art's most necessary function: the placing of craft {{at the service of}} altering our sense of the real. This Ojeda does without recourse to the cantankerous and gimmicky cult of pseudo-novelty which has characterized North American, and especially New York, art over the last few years. Ojeda does not seek to explode reality, to denote it with the flashy burden of art that is more junk than irreverence. Ojeda undermines, rather than ambushes, the boundaries of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> real." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that Android {{will serve as}} Google's future main laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by 2017. [...] Google's Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android, explained that [...] "mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> desktop today." [...] and back in 2009, Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would [...] "likely converge over time." [...] Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that [...] "While we've been working on ways to bring together {{the best of both}} operating systems, there's no plan to phase out Chrome OS [...] guaranteed auto-updates for five years". That is unlike Android where support is shorter with [...] "EOL dates [...] at least 3 years [...] for Android tablets for education".|$|E

2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to Q from [...] and said, [...] "Her entire existence is so {{unlike that of}} ours that she really has to learn about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." [...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to {{all corners of the}} Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] {{one of the first people}} we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

50|$|Before <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> {{a modern}} wind band came into existence, wind players found the {{orchestra}} to be a suitable outlet for musical expression.

Composers such as Stravinsky were key in the advancement of winds.|$|E
5000|$|Physically, we can {{say that}} a {{propagating}} fermion interacts with its surrounding {{in such a way that}} the net effect of the interactions is to make the fermion behave as a [...] "dressed" [...] fermion, altering its effective mass and other dynamical properties.

50|$|Concepts {{of what is}} the West arose out of {{legacies}} of the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire.

5000|$|O'Connor {{has made}} a study of 20th Century drama, {{particularly}} neglected or forgotten works. In 1997 O'Connor wrote Straight Acting; Popular Gay Drama from Wilde to Rattigan examining the work of British gay playwrights who dominated the West End in the 20th Century. Dartmouth's Professor of Gender Studies, Michael Bronski, praised the book claiming that it 'almost single-handedly reinvents <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> the history of modern gay theater.' ...|$|E
5000|$|These {{newly formed}} {{antibodies}} would arrive {{too late in}} an acute infection, however, so <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> [...] "immunology" [...] constitutes only {{the second half of}} the process.

5000|$|The pure ego is what James {{refers to}} as the [...] "I" [...] self. For James, the pure ego is what {{provides}} the thread of continuity between our past, present, and future selves. The pure ego's perception of consistent individual identity arises from a continual stream of consciousness. James believed that the pure ego was similar to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> the soul, or the mind.

50|$|Chinex Classic (19302-40s) {{is one of}} {{the most}} elegant Depression glass {{patterns}} and fits in with most fine china sets with an elaborately scrolled lacy pattern. Macbeth-Evans seemed to have seen the wave of the future and produced this delicate ivory and cremax pattern with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> 50s and 60s colored accents. Chinex Classic fits well into a Depression Era setting, or it can be used to bring a 50s look for your kitchen. Some patterns also have impressions of florals and castles.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Simon and Schuster's book newsletter, author Scott Westerfeld talks about the inspiration behind the series. Westerfeld thinks that the future will allow people greater control over their appearance: [...] "We are definitely heading toward {{a world in which}} lots of people will get to decide how they look.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of crafts {{in areas like}} the Ottoman Empire involved the governing bodies requiring members of the city who were skilled at creating goods to open shops {{in the center of}} town.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{if we say}} that some future, [...] "ideal" [...] physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for {{we have no idea}} of what this means. The [...] "ideal" [...] physics may even come to define <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> mental as part of the {{physical}} world. In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.|$|E

It is the human being." [...] Award-winning filmmaker Ruhi Hamid said: [...] "It is the most extraordinary film I have ever seen.

50|$|Since the {{vibrations}} of a supermembrane of infinite energy can correspond to every particle in the Universe at {{once it is}} possible to interpret the supermembrane as equivalent to the Universe. i.e. all that exists is the supermembrane. It makes no difference to say we live on this supermembrane or that we in the 11 dimensional space-time. Every state of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane and every history of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane world volume. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> space-time coordinates can equally be thought of as vector fields on the 2+1 dimensional supermembrane.|$|E
25|$|The medieval European {{farmhouse}} embodies <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{today as}} one of the most archetypal examples of a courtyard housefour buildings arranged around a square courtyard with a steep roof covered by thatch. The central courtyard was used for working, gathering, and sometimes keeping small livestock. An elevated walkway frequently ran around two or three sides of the courtyards in the houses. Such structures afforded protection, and could even be made defensible.|$|R

Smith also wrote an article about Hawaii that appeared in Granta 77: <b>What</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> America (2002).|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{contemporary}} gender-responsiveness movement {{can be traced back}} to a selection of works written by Barbara Bloom and Stephanie Covington in the early 2000's. [...] Their case for, and articulation of gender-responsiveness, forms the theoretical backbone from which many others develop theories and/or criticisms of gender-responsive prisons. Many of the suggestions and implementation strategies forwarded in these texts were integral in constructing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> today as gender-responsive prisons.|$|R
