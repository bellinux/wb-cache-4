50|$|Faux wood blinds are an {{alternative}} to real wood blinds. Faux wood is also known in some countries as Plaswood (Plastic & Wood). Made of a composite of man-made materials and natural wood particles, faux wood can be a less expensive choice than natural wood. These blinds have become more popular as the products have matured, becoming cheaper and more versatile {{at the same time}} offering more of a natural wood look. Current faux wood blinds are <b>warp</b> <b>resistant,</b> have UV ratings as high as 500 and come in colors that would be hard to find in natural wood blinds.Because of their resistance to warping, faux wood window blinds are suitable for areas with extreme temperature swings or high moisture, such as bathrooms and kitchens.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Document skew {{detection}} {{is often}} {{done by the}} use of horizontal projections. In this paper, we introduce a new document skew detection approach that is based on vertical projections as well as bounding box minimization criterion. We motivated {{by the fact that the}} majority of the Latin characters have vertical strokes. We claim that the proposed approach is more efficient and gives more accurate results compared with the state-of-the-art skew detection algorithm based on horizontal projections since it is noise and <b>warp</b> <b>resistant.</b> For these reasons, it can be efficiently applied to historical machine printed documents. Experimental results on a database with representative historical printed documents prove the efficiency of the proposed approach. Moreover, an analysis of the performance of the main elements of the proposed technique is also done...|$|E
50|$|The main {{utility of}} chinaberry is its timber. This is of medium density, and ranges in colour from light brown to dark red. In {{appearance}} it is readily {{confused with the}} unrelated Burmese teak (Tectona grandis). Melia azedarach - in keeping {{with other members of}} the family Meliaceae - has a timber of high quality, but as opposed to many almost-extinct species of mahogany, it is under-utilised. Seasoning is relatively simple, in that planks dry without cracking or <b>warping</b> and are <b>resistant</b> to fungal infection. The taste of the leaves is not as bitter as neem (Azadirachta indica).|$|R
30|$|The main {{utility of}} M. azedarach is its {{high-quality}} timber. Seasoning is relatively simple in that planks which dry without cracking or <b>warping</b> and are <b>resistant</b> to fungal infection. The wood {{is used to}} manufacture agricultural implements, furniture, plywood, boxes, poles, and tool handles [1]. It is also used in cabinet making {{as well as in}} construction [4]. Besides, M. azedarach is a multi-purpose tree species. Its leaves can be used as green manure and insecticides. It is often planted for fuel supply in Middle East and in Assam (India), where it is grown on tea estates for fuel [1]. In Vietnam, most of the M. azedarach were planted in short rotation around 5 – 6  years with the purpose to supply raw material for pulp and particleboard industries.|$|R
