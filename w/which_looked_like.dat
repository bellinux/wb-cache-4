5|$|On February 13, 1991, a {{local group}} in Albany, New York, fought the government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Blinky, to the commission. In addition to that they performed a rap song, which explained {{the plot of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Lockheed {{settled on}} the CL-400 design, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a greatly scaled-up Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. The main change to the layout were the twin engines, mounted on the wing tips. LH2 was {{selected}} due to its predictable burning characteristics and the fuel's light weight, although the low density required the enormous fuselage to hold the required fuel load. In addition to Lockheed, Pratt and Whitney played a major part.|$|E
25|$|Between 1951 and 1969, {{a limited}} number of O gauge train sets were {{manufactured}} in the Soviet Union. Utilizing the same track and voltage as their U.S. counterparts, the colorful locomotives and cars resembled pre-World War II designs from U.S. manufacturers Lionel and American Flyer and the couplers were nearly identical to those of pre-war American Flyer. Some differences in U.S. and Soviet railroading were evident from comparing the Soviet sets with U.S. sets, particularly {{in the design of the}} boxcar, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an American Flyer boxcar with windows added, reflecting the Soviets' use of box cars to haul livestock, as well as merchandise.|$|E
25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the human interface in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the command button space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities that you can find on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much. The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} railway had ten four-wheel, tramcar-like carriages, {{built at}} the Falcon Works, Loughborough, and numbered from 1 to 10, with a brake van from the same source taking the number 11. The first bogie carriage, also from Falcon, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> two four-wheel bodies mounted on a single chassis, received number 12, and the four-wheelers were rebuilt {{over a five-year period}} on new chassis to form five bogie vehicles. A re-numbering had the rebuilds as 1 to 5 and the former 12 becoming 6. Two all-new carriages to a similar design were built by the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd and numbered 7 & 8. Nos. 1 to 6 disappeared, presumed scrapped, after 1930; however Nos. 7 and 8 were used by a GWR employee at his home in Gobowen and subsequently preserved. No. 8 (used as a greenhouse-cum-garden shed) was recovered in 1958 and rebuilt for use on the Talyllyn Railway as their No.17 while No.7 (used as a chicken coop) was recovered ten years later and is on display in the Corris Railway Museum. The brake van was also preserved on the Talyllyn but has been substantially rebuilt after being damaged in a fire.|$|E
25|$|All {{records of}} an early {{existence}} of Christians in South Canara were lost {{at the time of}} their deportation by Tippu Sultan in 1784. Hence, it is not known when exactly Christianity was introduced in South Canara, although it is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara just as they did in Kerala, a state south of Canara. The Italian traveler Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast in the 13th century. It can be surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce and possibly some Christian priests might have accompanied them for evangelistic work. In April 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in south-western France) with four other friars landed at Thana. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon in 1328. About 1493, a cross was caught in the net by some fishermen off Mangalore. It was made of Olive wood, well finished and one span and a half in length, indicating the possibility of a Christian community in Mangalore. Some crosses painted black and red were discovered by the Portuguese in 1505 while digging up for laying the foundation for a fortress at Anjediva in North Canara. According to Paulo da Trinidade, they appeared to have belonged to a chapel or church of Christians. It is difficult to say whether these findings were Christian crosses or some other objects <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> crosses and actually were instruments used by Hindus for astronomical observations. According to Historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. Even if it is assumed that Christianity existed in South Canara before the arrival of the Portuguese, the Christian community must have disappeared by 1498.|$|E
500|$|Gamania Entertainment {{hosted a}} {{collaboration}} event with Clannad {{and their two}} massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) Hiten Online and Holy Beast Online. Between March 26 and June 26, 2008, the two games offered costumes characters could wear <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the winter school uniforms from Clannad, along with offering Kyou's pet boar Botan for players to adopt. Players of either game who had a character over level 20 could enter a lottery where 500 people were chosen to win Clannad-related goods which included virtual and real-world items such as file folders, [...] "netcash" [...] cards, sports towels, tapestries, and various items used during gameplay.|$|E

500|$|Without the engineers, {{the plans}} to develop Goodenough Island {{had to be}} postponed. Due to the {{strategic}} importance of the island for the forthcoming operations against the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area, the small Australian occupation force used deception and camouflage to make the Japanese believe that a brigade-sized force [...] occupied the island. They fabricated dummy structures, including a hospital, anti-aircraft guns constructed of simple logs pointed at the sky, and barricades of jungle vines <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> barbed wire. They also lit fires to appear as cooking fires for large numbers of soldiers, and sent messages in easily broken codes consistent with a brigade.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of V'Ger caused {{problems for the}} entire production. The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot clay model created by the Abel group, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a modernized Nemo's Nautilus submarine. Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize {{a new version of}} the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. The final model was [...] long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, macramé, Styrofoam cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.|$|E
500|$|Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up {{with the}} concept of [...] "Elmo's World", and writer Tony Geiss and {{executive}} producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism {{of the rest of the}} show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life" [...] created by the host, and with [...] "a stream-of-consciousness feel to it". [...] Elmo's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen.|$|E

500|$|Animator Mo Willems came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} a less-realistic setting compared to the rest of the show. The segment presented Elmo, first portrayed by Kevin Clash and then by Ryan Dillon after its revamp in 2017, moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life" [...] created by the host, and with [...] "a stream-of-consciousness feel to it". [...] The segment was filmed at a different time than the rest of the season, much of it in front of a blue screen, with animation and digital effects added later. [...] For more complicated shots that showed Elmo's entire body, a puppet called [...] "Active Elmo" [...] was operated with assistance from other puppeteers; the puppet was also filmed in front of a blue screen and edited later.|$|E
500|$|Make-up artist Greg Cannom {{was pleased}} to be {{involved}} in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce [...] "incredible and original make-ups". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the [...] "House of Wax". Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors {{in an effort to get}} the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn’t lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.|$|E
500|$|Rest of the {{ensemble}} included leather, metallic combinations, green silk vest from A.F. Vandevorst, and cotton clothing from Greg Lauren. The lace shorts Madonna wore was vintage, and Åkerlund burnt up the singer's Agent Provocateur bra and applied dirt on it for giving special effects. The whole inspiration for Åkerlund behind the look was Jonas, {{as well as the}} couple's interest in rock-n-roll. Madonna approved the design, saying that [...] "It was magical... It perfectly represented the vibe that we wanted to bring to the video." [...] She also asked for a golf club and pocket knife to make the look more edgy. With Swedish broadcasting channel Sveriges Television, Åkerlund explained that for the opening shot, where Madonna is shown laying on the bed, she wanted boots <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> leg braces. She contacted a designer in New York who said that he developed such pieces for fetish fashion. Åkerlund wanted him to provide the designs for arms also.|$|E

500|$|Attempts {{were made}} {{as early as}} 1937 by Walt Disney to adapt Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, [...] "The Snow Queen", into a film. The tale focuses on two children, one named Gerda, {{who served as the}} basis for Princess Anna, and the other named Kai, who is [...] "cursed with negativity" [...] after his heart is pierced with a shard of glass from an enchanted mirror and is later kidnapped by the Snow Queen. However, Disney {{struggled}} with creating a believable, multi-dimensional adaption of the fairy tale's title character, who was intended to be a villain. In the story, she is described as [...] "a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice—shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in their glance." [...] Disney was unable {{to find a way to}} make the Snow Queen more real and eventually abandoned film plans.|$|E
500|$|The {{line was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously {{even though she}} is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "L.A.M.B.'s embellished tracksuits, Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge" [...] Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, [...] "The collection, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in the}} eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend." [...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If ever there was a reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E
500|$|Exceptions {{are made}} for {{children}} and a person [...] "in the exercise of his calling" [...] (a professional person or somebody exercising a trade or skill). With children, occupiers must [...] "be prepared for children to be less careful than adults"; a warning notice, for example, would normally {{be good enough to}} alert adults to a potential danger, but not to alert children. This is another extension of a common law principle; in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor [...] 1 AC 44, a seven-year-old child died after eating poisonous berries from a bush in a park. The berries, <b>which</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> cherries or blackcurrants, were found by the House of Lords to constitute an [...] "allurement" [...] to the child, who found Glasgow Corporation, which owned the park, liable. However, the situation is different if the child has a guardian with him, who one would expect to appreciate any obvious dangers, as in Phipps v Rochester Corporation [...] 1 QB 450. This was essentially the same as the existing common law; indeed, [...] "It is doubtful whether the Act alters the law at all on this point".|$|E
