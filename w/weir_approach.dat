40|$|Abstract? The {{ability of}} {{individual}} and groups of 30 migrating adult river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis L. to pass a Crump or flat-v gauging weir under two discharge regimes (moderate and low) was assessed in an experimental channel. Despite repeated attempts by the lamprey, the Crump weir remained impassable during all trials. Lamprey passage over the flat-v weir occurred only during group trials at low discharge (5. 73 ± 0. 19 L s? 1) and only as a single burst swimming event via the deeper water passing over {{the centre of the}} weir. Lampreys generally approached the weirs along the channel walls and particularly favoured the true right wall associated with elevated velocities during low discharge and reverse currents at moderate discharge (68. 06 ± 2. 41 L s? 1). Time spent immediately below the weir was lower than expected compared with further downstream. Rate of <b>weir</b> <b>approach,</b> attempts to pass (absolute number and as a proportion of the total approaches) and time spent immediately downstream of the weir were highest for the Crump weir at low discharge and the flat-v weir at moderate discharge. The present study suggests that gauging weirs may severely impede the movements of migrating adult river lamprey under low to moderate discharges. <br/...|$|E

40|$|East Fork Irrigation District (EFID) {{operates}} a 127 -cfs diversion on the East Fork Hood River near Parkdale, OR. Very high glacial sand/silt {{content of the}} diverted water requires separation of sand at a facility near the point of diversion. A fish screen incorporated into this facility uses a “prototype” technology with a horizontal profile bar “Coanda” screen in an ogee-shaped <b>weir.</b> Calculated <b>approach</b> velocities significantly exceed generally accepted fish protection criteria, although sweeping velocities are very high and exposure times for fish passing over the weir/screen are less than one second. Biological performance tests using newly buttoned-up Chinook salmon and steelhead fry (30 - 50 mm) and steelhead smolts (130 - 260 mm) were conducted {{in the spring of}} 1999 to evaluate passage over the weir/screen components of facility in terms of fish injury or latent mortality. Results indicate that no injuries, behavioral anomalies or latent mortalities resulted from passage over the weir/screen for any of the three species / life stages of fish tested. Results are compared to other biological performance studies of fish screens throughout the region. This report concludes that the “Coanda” type fish screens incorporated into EFID’s sand trap and fish screen facility perform at least as well as any of the other screening systems reported and better than most, and that incorporation of this technology into the EFID facility does not pose an injury or latent mortality threat to juvenile salmonid fishes in the system...|$|R
40|$|Foam {{drainage}} {{is considered}} in a froth flotation cell. Air {{flow through the}} foam is described by a simple two-dimensional deceleration flow, modelling the foam spilling over a weir. Foam microstructure is given {{in terms of the}} number of channels (Plateau borders) per unit area, which scales as the inverse square of bubble size. The Plateau border number density decreases with height in the foam, and also decreases horizontally as the <b>weir</b> is <b>approached.</b> Foam drainage equations, applicable in the dry foam limit, are described. These can be used to determine the average cross-sectional area of a Plateau border, denoted A, as a function of position in the foam. Quasi-one-dimensional solutions are available in which A only varies vertically, in spite of the two-dimensional nature of the air flow and Plateau border number density fields. For such situations the liquid drainage relative to the air flow is purely vertical. The parametric behaviour of the system is investigated with respect to a number of dimensionless parameters: K (the strength of capillary suction relative to gravity), α (the deceleration of the air flow), and n and h (respectively, the horizontal and vertical variations of the Plateau border number density). The parameter K is small, implying the existence of boundary layer solutions: capillary suction is negligible except in thin layers near the bottom boundary. The boundary layer thickness (when converted back to dimensional variables) is independent of the height of the foam. The deceleration parameter α affects the Plateau border area on the top boundary: weaker decelerations give larger Plateau border areas at the surface. For weak decelerations, there is rapid convergence of the boundary layer solutions at the bottom onto ones with negligible capillary suction higher up. For strong decelerations, two branches of solutions for A are possible in the K = 0 limit: one is smooth, and the other has a distinct kink. The full system, with small but non-zero capillary suction, lies relatively close to the kinked solution branch, but convergence from the lower boundary layer onto this branch is distinctly slow. Variations in the Plateau border number density (non-zero n and h) increase individual Plateau border areas relative to the case of uniformly sized bubbles. For strong decelerations and negligible capillarity, solutions closely follow the kinked solution branch if bubble sizes are only slightly non-uniform. As the extent of non-uniformity increases, the Plateau border area reaches a maximum corresponding to no net upward velocity of foam liquid. In the case of vertical variation of number density, liquid content profiles and Plateau border area profiles cease to be simply proportional to one another. Plateau border areas match at the top of the foam independent of h, implying a considerable difference in liquid content for foams which exhibit different number density profiles...|$|R
40|$|Le {{comportement}} hydraulique des déversoirs d’orage latéraux est le plus souvent marqué par une évolution discontinue de la ligne d’eau caractérisée par le ressaut hydraulique (Torrentiel/fluvial) et, dans certains cas, par une évolution rapidement variée causée par un écoulement également transcritique mais dans le sens fluvial/Torrentiel. Concernant les modèles actuels, ils ne permettent pas de simuler le comportement en transitoire de ce type d’ouvrage. Compte tenu de cela, nous avons modélisé l’ouvrage par les équations de Barré de Saint Venant écrite sous forme conservative en régime transitoire et couplée au modèle de déversoir de Hager. Le caractère conservatif de ces équations {{permet de}} transcrire dans un seul système d’équations les écoulements graduellement et rapidement variés. Afin de résoudre ces équations, nous avons utilisé le schéma numérique UPWIND à « capture de choc » du second ordre du type TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) utilisant le solveur de Roe. Dans l’objectif de valider notre démarche, nous avons créé un pilote de déversoir d’orage sur le site d’Obernai (laboratoire d'hydraulique du lycée agricole). Nous avons fait varier : le diamètre de la conduite aval par rapport au diamètre de la conduite amont, la longueur du déversoir, les pentes des conduites amont et aval ainsi que la hauteur de crête. La comparaison des débits déversés entre les modèles physique et numérique a montré que l’erreur observée rapportée au débit amont n’excédait jamais 13 % avec une majorité des cas entre ± 5 %. In recent years, French and European legislation has introduced regulations about wastewater discharge into natural environments and particularly about combined sewer overflows. As a consequence, {{it has become}} essential to control the hydraulic behaviour of these structures and to estimate the pollution loads released at this level. The side weir is the regulation structure that permits the hydraulic regulation of the waste water carried by the sewer system. When the upstream flow intensity exceeds a value referred to as reference flow, the side weir directly rejects part of the waste water to the natural environment. The hydraulic behaviour of the sewer side weir was shown to involve a discontinuous evolution of the water depth, characterized by a hydraulic jump (transition from supercritical to subcritical flow) and also by a rapidly varying transcritical evolution (subcritical to supercritical). Initially, the side weir flow was determined {{with the use of}} empirical relations. Using formulae of Engels, Coleman and Smith, Balmaceda and Gonzales or Dominguez, it was possible to calculate the outflow according to the water level at the upstream and/or the downstream region of the weir. These relations were applicable only for certain flow regimes and in certain cases in which the geometry of the side weir was specified. Subsequently, a more physical approach, initiated by Ackers, was based on the assumption of constant energy along the side <b>weir.</b> This <b>approach</b> made it possible to focus not only on an assessment of the side channel flow, but also on the water profile at the crest. Unfortunately, as the study of El Kashab shows, this method falls short in certain cases because the equations are inappropriate. For example, in the case of hydraulics the constant energy approach was not applicable. Finally, the method that is currently used is based on a momentum equation, which makes it possible to establish equations for shallow water. This approach seemed the most appropriate {{in the case of the}} side weir. The numerical solution of these equations was always based on an algorithm that describes all the possible cases according to the flow regime and the hydraulic conditions in the side weir. One must know the flow regime a priori. These models don’t properly simulate the transitory behaviour of these kinds of works. In this article we propose hydraulic modelling of a sewer side weir that integrates the geometrical characteristics of the flow (height and length of the crest, variation of width along the crest), and avoids the need for a priori knowledge of flow conditions in the side weir. The model also takes into account hydraulic discontinuities (hydraulic jump, transitions from free surface to pressurised flow) and the transitory character of the flow. The numerical results were compared with measured values obtained from a test bench. For the 1 D approach, the solution was found using the 1 D shallow water equations written in a conservative form for a transitory situation. The conservative characters of the equations permit us to consider gradually and rapidly varied flows in a single system of equations. In order to account for the lateral overflow, we used the Hager relation, which involves the intensity and direction of the lateral velocity vector and also the influence of width variation of the side weir. The shallow water equations system couldn’t be analytically solved. As a consequence, numerous numerical methods have been developed such as characteristic methods or finite difference methods. Unfortunately, these methods are inadequate when discontinuities such as hydraulic jumps or flow regime transitions (froude number close to 1) appear. To solve these problems, numerical (shock capturing) schemes were developed, based on a finite volume formulation. Godunov was the initiator of this type of finite volume numerical scheme. Eleuterio improved the precision and the ability of these numerical schemes to converge. The result was a combination of total variation diminishing (TVD) interpolation with an appropriate Riemann solver. We used a second order TVD Upwind shock capturing numerical method associated with the Roe Riemann solver. In order to validate the numerical model, we have built a sewer side weir physical test bench at the Obernai site. The variable parameters were the downstream pipe diameter in comparison with the upstream pipe diameter, the side weir length, slopes of the upstream and downstream pipes and the height of the crest. The tested cases permitted us to sweep a slope ranging from 0. 5 ‰ to 1 % for the upstream and downstream pipes. Globally, 114 configurations have been tested with the 1 D numerical model. The operating curve represents a criterion for characterising the operating of the storm overflow. As long as the upstream flow does not reach the reference value, there is no overflow. As soon as the upstream flow exceeds the value, the downstream flow remains close to the reference value. Because comparisons were made in relation with the upstream flow, the criterion used for judging the modelling performance was the absolute error value in relation to the upstream flow. It is important to note that the results need to be weighted as experimental measurements have a margin of error of approximately 5 %. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results permit the following conclusions: 1. The distribution of the number of errors was very close to the normal Gaussian distribution curve, with a slight shift towards the positive side. This indicates that the errors were random and therefore very close to experimental values. 2. In general, the maximum errors varied from - 10 to 13 %, with the majority of cases occurring between – 5 and + 5 %. This shows that the performance of the tool was very useful in cases that are as complex as side weirs. However, the model has a slight tendency to overestimate the overflow rate as compared to experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|The Meuse in the Netherlands is {{since the}} 1920 s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs {{regulate}} the water {{levels in the}} canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m 3 /s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and {{is part of the}} smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20. 80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The <b>weirs</b> are <b>approaching</b> the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called "new risks". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new weir gate. The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This {{is the result of the}} storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new weir. Due to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable flap gate. The flap gate is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The flap gate is designed in concrete class C 90 / 105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a prefabricated element. The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.
