Who knows what fortune <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> us? Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E
25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long <b>will</b> <b>do.</b> <b>For</b> the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

He {{had been to}} the forefront of the attack and, at one point, called out to Lord Stirling, [...] "Come here, you damned rebel, and I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you!" [...] Stirling's response was to instruct four marksmen to concentrate their fire upon the captain. Finch soon received a wound, from which he died three days later.|$|E

One notable recording was Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, a 1961 Cold War propaganda piece sponsored by the American Medical Association. In his speech, Reagan purports that Social Security is a socialist attempt to supplant private savings, and eventually concludes that, [...] "Pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a living.

500|$|There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer. The process {{involves}} the Scientist {{engaging in a}} silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter, something Christian Science practitioners <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a fee, including in absentia, to address ill health or other problems. Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is [...] "not curative... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims {{to lead to a}} state of consciousness where these things do not exist. What heals is the realization that there is nothing really to heal." [...] It is a closed system of thought, viewed as infallible if performed correctly; healing confirms the power of Truth, but its absence derives from the failure, specifically the bad thoughts, of individuals.|$|E

The expedition to Punt is {{referred to in the}} letter from Pepi II Neferkare to Harkuf some 100 years later. Harkuf had reported that he would bring back a [...] "dwarf of the god's dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers". Pepi mentions that the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum had returned from Punt with a dwarf during the reign of Djedkare Isesi and had been richly rewarded. The decree mentions that [...] "My Majesty <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you something greater than what was done for the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum in the reign of Isesi, reflecting my majesty's yearning to see this dwarf".|$|E
500|$|Joseph Foraker {{was sworn}} in as {{governor}} on January 12, 1886, during an intense blizzard that prevented many of the political marching clubs hoping to honor him from reaching Columbus. [...] In his inaugural address, he urged election reform, creation of a liquor licensing bureau, the abolition of laws that discriminated against blacks, and the establishment of a state board of health. [...] With a Republican majority in both houses, the legislature enacted many of his proposals, including the Poorman Law, requiring voter registration in Cleveland and Cincinnati (and later in all large cities), as well as the Pugsley Law, which established nonpartisan boards to appoint election officials. [...] The Ohio State Journal commented, [...] "Not all that is needed in the way of amendments to the election laws of Ohio, but it <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a starter." [...] The Dow Law imposed an annual tax on businesses in the alcohol trade; most of the proceeds would go for poor relief and to the police fund. [...] With Foraker's support, the remaining laws that allowed racial discrimination in Ohio were repealed.|$|E
500|$|Susan B. Anthony, Stanton's {{best and}} most {{faithful}} collaborator, concluded after years of working for women's rights that the concentration on one issue—votes for women—was the key to bringing success to the movement. The women's organizations had too varied a membership to agree on anything more complex. Stanton insisted, however, that the women's rights conventions were too narrowly focused; she brought forward a variety of challenging concepts {{in the form of}} essays for Anthony to read to the audiences. When Stanton made known her interest in completing The Woman's Bible, Anthony was unhappy at the futility of the effort, a harmful digression from the focused path which led to woman suffrage. Anthony wrote to Clara Bewick Colby to say of Stanton [...] "of all her great speeches, I am always proud—but of her Bible commentaries, I am not proud—either of their spirit or letter... But I shall love and honor her to the end—whether her Bible please me or not. So I hope she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 23, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song, [...] "a cheery little tune about death, {{destruction and}} the end of the world" [...] was the result of Scotti Brothers Records' insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was [...] "a little different from what they were expecting." [...] After the song's release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to [...] "most people [...] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season." [...] Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term [...] "ground zero" [...] was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of those attacks took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the Bronx, New York that looked like a bomb had gone off. The final original that was recorded was [...] "Good Enough for Now", a country music pastiche about how the singer's lover, who, while not the best, <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> now.|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

Rabbi Nehemiah thus read [...] to mean: [...] "I am the Lord, the One Who will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [...] The Gemara reported that the Rabbis of a Baraita, however, read [...] to mean: [...] "When I shall bring you out, I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you something that will show you that I am the One Who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin knew he {{was going}} to be killed. According to Rachel Plummer's account, Benjamin {{returned}} to the fort, after his first talk with the war party, and told his brother and father that he believed they would all be killed, and that they should run swiftly to the woods. Silas again argued with him, telling him they should push the big gate shut, and man the walls. Ben pointed out, rightly, Rachel said, that there was no time, and their [...] "course was decided." [...] He told her, [...] "run little Rachel, for your life and your unborn child, run now and fast!" [...] She said he then straightened up and went back outside. She recounted how Silas told her to watch the front gate, after Benjamin had gone out to talk to the Indians the second time, when she herself wanted to flee, while he ran for his musket and powder pouch. “They will kill Benjamin,” she reported her Uncle Silas saying, “and then me, but I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> at least one of them, by God.” At that moment, she said she heard whooping outside the fort, and then Indians were inside.|$|E
2500|$|Within the churchyard, to the {{south-west}} of the tower, is a stone {{marker for}} {{the grave of}} Henry Trigg. Trigg was the Berden parish constable {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, and ran a shoe shop adjacent to Berden Hall in the village. On the night of 25 March 1814 two men from Bishops Stortford, a William Pratt and a Thomas Turner, broke into Trigg's shop to thieve leather goods. They were confronted by Trigg and his father. Trigg offered defence by disabling Turner, but after a Pratt attempt to shoot Trigg’s father with a double-barrelled gun, both father and son made to escape. Pratt, using the words [...] "Now, damn your heart, I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you", then shot Trigg in the chest, killing him. A year later Pratt and Turner were captured by the Bow Street Runners, sentenced to death, and sent to the gallows. The words [...] "In memory of Henry Trigg of this Parish Aged 36 years Who was murdered March 25th 1814 endeavouring to protect his property" [...] were recorded as written on the tombstone. Following the execution of Pratt and Turner, a postscript was reportedly added to Trigg’s stone: [...] "March 13th 1815 Wm Pratt, Thos Turner Both of Bishops Stortford, Herts. Were executed at Chelmsford for the above offence on their own confession".|$|E
