500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a shrink wrap on the US covers, so that when one took it off, there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and at that time we always started with the album cover configuration. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{a moment}} Pratt meditated interference, but {{something}} in the movement and face of the visitor deterred him. As Serviss followed his guide up the great stairway, he asked himself: [...] "What will <b>she</b> <b>be</b> <b>like?</b> <b>She</b> must <b>be</b> changed--deeply changed. How will she meet me?" [...] He acknowledged a growing excitement.|$|R
60|$|Winifred was {{watching}} from her distance. She {{was as if}} amused, but rather unsure as yet what this new person <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> saw so many new persons, and so few who became real to her. Mademoiselle was of no count whatever, the child merely put up with her, calmly and easily, accepting her little authority with faint scorn, compliant out of childish arrogance of indifference.|$|E
60|$|The three {{managed to}} get down to tell the unfortunate inmates of the cabin what was the state of things, and to carry them some food, though at the expense of many falls and severe blows; and almost all of them were too faint or nauseated to be able to swallow such food as could survive the {{transport}} under such circumstances. Yet high-spirited little Estelle entreated to be carried on deck, to see what a storm <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> had read of them so often, and wanted to see as well as to feel. She was almost ready to cry when Arthur assured her it was quite impossible, and her mother added a grave order not to trouble him.|$|E
60|$|It was scarce {{daylight}} {{when they}} were aroused by a great stir on board the ship, and, hastily putting on their clothes, went on deck. Already a crowd of men were aloft loosening the sails. Others had taken their places in boats in readiness to tow the ship, for the wind was, as yet, so light that it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> would scarce have steerage way, {{and there were many}} sharp angles in the course down the river to be rounded, and shallows to be avoided. A few minutes later the moorings were cast off, the sails sheeted home, and the crew gave a great cheer, which was answered from the dockyard, and from boats alongside, full of the relations and friends of the sailors, who stood up and waved their hats and shouted good bye.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the book}} sees Patty {{reflecting}} on what her life after college might <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> plays hooky from chapel and meets a bishop. In a chat with the bishop, Patty realizes that being irresponsible and evasive at a young age could adversely affect her character as an adult and decides to try to be a more responsible person.|$|R

If she had known what the show would <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> [...] "never would have left the job at Fair Go". In 2014, she left to work at Radio Live.|$|R
50|$|As a {{nice and}} {{intelligent}} girl, Limon usually plays along. She {{is not a}} stereotypical nerd, but she is curious to learn and is diligent {{when it comes to}} school work. <b>She</b> <b>likes</b> to <b>be</b> praised and to <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>She</b> resorts to her charm and sense of humor to get her way when she wants something at home or in school. She often challenges her parents with her thoughtful, “brilliant” questions.|$|R
60|$|She {{was in a}} mood of the {{greatest}} depression. On arriving, and seeing what the tavern <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> had been taken by surprise; but having gone too far to retreat, she had heroically entered {{and sat down on}} the well-scrubbed settle, opposite the narrow table with its knives and steel forks, tin pepper-boxes, blue salt-cellars, and posters advertising the sale of bullocks against the wall. The last time that she had taken any meal in a public place it had been with Fitzpiers at the grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel in that town, after a two months' roaming and sojourning at the gigantic hotels of the Continent. How could she have expected any other kind of accommodation in present circumstances than such as Giles had provided? And yet how unprepared she was for this change! The tastes that she had acquired from Fitzpiers had been imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed them till confronted by this contrast. The elegant Fitzpiers, in fact, at that very moment owed a long bill at the above-mentioned hotel for the luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever they drove to Sherton. But such is social sentiment, that she had been quite comfortable under those debt-impending conditions, while she felt humiliated by her present situation, which Winterborne had paid for honestly on the nail.|$|E
60|$|Tara of Helium let her slow gaze wander {{among the}} throng of guests until {{presently}} it halted upon one she sought. Was the faint {{shadow of a}} frown that crossed her brow an indication of displeasure at the sight that met her eyes, or did the brilliant rays of the noonday sun distress her? Who may say! She had been reared to believe that one day she should wed Djor Kantos, son of her father's best friend. It had been the dearest wish of Kantos Kan and The Warlord that this should be, and Tara of Helium had accepted it {{as a matter of}} all but accomplished fact. Djor Kantos had seemed to accept the matter in the same way. They had spoken of it casually as something that would, as a matter of course, take place in the indefinite future, as, for instance, his promotion in the navy, in which he was now a padwar; or the set functions of the court of her grandfather, Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium; or Death. They had never spoken of love and that had puzzled Tara of Helium upon the rare occasions she gave it thought, for she knew that people who were to wed were usually much occupied with the matter of love and she had all of a woman's curiosity--she wondered what love <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> was very fond of Djor Kantos and she knew that he was very fond of her. They liked to be together, for they liked the same things and the same people and the same books and their dancing was a joy, not only to themselves but to those who watched them. She could not imagine wanting to marry anyone other than Djor Kantos.|$|E
60|$|Jill, {{unconscious}} of {{the discomfort}} she was causing, continued to gaze. She {{was trying to}} discover in just what respect he had changed from the god he had been. Certainly not in looks. He was as handsome as ever--handsomer, indeed, for the sunshine and clean breezes of the Atlantic had given him an exceedingly becoming coat of tan. And yet he must have changed, for now she could look upon him quite dispassionately and criticize him without a tremor. It was like seeing {{a copy of a}} great painting. Everything was there, except the one thing that mattered, the magic and the glamour. It <b>was</b> <b>like....</b> <b>She</b> suddenly remembered a scene in the dressing-room when the company had been in Baltimore. Lois Denham, duly the recipient of the sunburst which her friend Izzy had promised her, had unfortunately, in a spirit of girlish curiosity, taken it to a jeweller to be priced, and the jeweller had blasted her young life by declaring it a paste imitation. Jill recalled how the stricken girl--previous to calling Izzy on the long distance and telling him a number of things which, while probably not news to him, must have been painful hearing--had passed the vile object round the dressing-room for inspection. The imitation was perfect. It had been impossible for the girls to tell that the stones were not real diamonds. Yet the jeweller, with his sixth sense, had seen through them in a trifle under ten seconds. Jill {{came to the conclusion that}} her newly-discovered love for Wally Mason had equipped her with a sixth sense, and that by its aid she was really for the first time seeing Derek as he was.|$|E

6000|$|So {{he looked}} past {{them into the}} temple halls; into a lustrous abyss of cool green shade, {{deepening}} on and inward, pillar after pillar, vista after vista, into deepest night. And dimly through the gloom he could descry, on every wall and column, gorgeous arabesques, long lines of pictured story; triumphs and labours; rows of captives in foreign and fantastic dresses, leading strange animals, bearing the tributes of unknown lands; rows of ladies at feasts, their heads crowned with garlands, the fragrant lotus-flower in every hand, while slaves brought wine and perfumes, and children sat upon their knees, and husbands by their side; and dancing girls, in transparent robes and golden girdles, tossed their tawny limbs wildly among the throng.... What was the meaning of it all? Why had it all been? Why had it gone on thus, the great world, century after century, millennium after millennium, eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, and knowing nothing better.... how could they know anything better? Their forefathers had lost the light ages and ages before they were born.... And Christ had not come for ages and ages after they were dead.... How could they know?.... And yet {{they were all in}} hell.... every one of them. Every one of these ladies who sat there, with her bushy locks, and garlands, and jewelled collars, and lotus-flowers, and gauzy dress, displaying all her slender limbs-who, perhaps, when she was alive, smiled so sweetly, and went so gaily, and had children, and friends, and never once thought of {{what was going to happen}} to her--what must happen to her.... She was in hell.... Burning for ever, and ever, and ever, there below his feet. He stared down on the rocky floors. If he could but see through them.... and the eye of faith could see through them.... he should behold her writhing and twisting among the flickering flame, scorched, glowing.... in everlasting agony, such as the thought of enduring for a moment made him shudder. He had burnt his hands once, when a palm-leaf but caught fire.... He recollected what that <b>was</b> <b>like....</b> <b>She</b> was enduring ten thousand times more than that for ever. He should hear her shrieking in vain for a drop of water to cool her tongue.... He had never heard a human being shriek but once.... a boy bathing on the opposite Nile bank, whom a crocodile had dragged down.... and that scream, faint and distant as it came across the mighty tide, had rung intolerable in his ears for days.... and to think of all which echoed through those vaults of fire-for ever! Was the thought bearable!--was it possible! Millions upon millions burning forever for Adam's fall .... Could God be just in that?....|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{am sorry}} to say, I have had a little quarrel with my aunt. It is all made up now, but it has hardly left us such good friends as we were before. Last week, there was a dinner-party here; and, among the guests, was a Hindoo gentleman (converted to Christianity) to whom my aunt has taken a great fancy. While the maid was {{dressing}} me, I unluckily inquired if {{she had seen the}} Hindoo--and, hearing that she had, I still more unfortunately asked her to tell me what he <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>She</b> described him as being very tall and lean, with a dark brown complexion and glittering black eyes. My mischievous fancy instantly set to work on this horrid combination of darknesses. Try as I might to resist it, my mind drew a dreadful picture of the Hindoo, as a kind of monster in human form. I would have given worlds to have been excused from going down into the drawing-room. At the last moment I was sent for, and the Hindoo was introduced to me. The instant I felt him approaching, my darkness was peopled with brown demons. He took my hand. I tried hard to control myself--but I really could not help shuddering and starting back when he touched me. To make matters worse, he sat next to me at dinner. In five minutes I had long, lean, black-eyed beings all round me; perpetually growing in numbers, and pressing closer and closer on me as they grew. It ended in my being obliged to leave the table. When the guests were all gone, my aunt was furious. I admitted my conduct was unreasonable in the last degree. At the same time, I begged her to make allowances for me. I reminded her that I was blind at a year old, and that I had really no idea of what any person was like, except by drawing pictures of them in my imagination, from description, and from my own knowledge obtained by touch. I appealed to her to remember that, situated as I am, my fancy is peculiarly liable to play me tricks, and that I have no sight to see with, and to show me--as other people's eyes show them--when they have taken a false view of persons and things. It was all in vain. My aunt would admit of no excuse for me. I was so irritated by her injustice, that I reminded her of an antipathy of her own, quite as ridiculous as mine--an antipathy to cats. She, who can see that cats are harmless, shudders and turns pale, for all that, if a cat is {{in the same room with}} her. Set my senseless horror of dark people against her senseless horror of cats--and say which of us has the right to be angry with the other?'" ...|$|E

Birds & Animals prefers to begin training younger monkeys, optimally those close to one year old. Audacious two-and-half-year-old Crystal, whose canine teeth had begun showing, was offered. The trainer ultimately decided to buy both Crystal and two younger capuchin monkeys. Three employees received the three monkeys. Crystal was given to Tom Gunderson, an employee who had only been with the company {{for a few years}} and had been primarily working at Universal Studios Florida's Animal Actors stage show.
