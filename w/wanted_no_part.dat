5|$|One {{consignment}} of 250 copies {{was stopped}} at Dover. Then the Chairman of the Board of Customs balked. He had read The Well and {{considered it a}} fine book, not at all obscene; he <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of suppressing it. On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were waiting with a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided {{whether or not he}} wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Although the Maritime {{leaders were}} swayed by the {{arguments}} of the Canadians, many ordinary residents of the Maritimes <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union. Many politicians who supported confederation, such as Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley (New Brunswick's best-known Father of Confederation), found themselves without a seat after the next election; nevertheless, backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed.|$|E

25|$|On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British {{government}} {{entered into}} a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches. However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when—they claimed—they had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA.|$|E
25|$|However, {{estimates}} of the Phalange's membership by Yezid Sayigh and other academic sources put them at a few thousand. Non-academic sources tend to inflate the Phalanges membership. What {{should be kept in}} mind was that this insurrection was met with widespread disapproval by many Lebanese who <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> in the regional politics and many young men aided the Phalange in their suppression of the insurrection, especially as many of the demonstrators were little more than proxy forces hired by groups such as the ANM and Fatah founders as well as being hired by the defeated parliamentary bosses.|$|E
25|$|With Irish Home Rule due {{to become}} law in 1914, and the Cabinet contemplating {{some kind of}} {{military}} action against the Ulster Volunteers who <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of it, French and Seely summoned Paget (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) to the War Office for talks, whilst Seely wrote to the Prime Minister (24 October 1913) about the potential use of General Macready, who had experience of peacekeeping in the South Wales coalfields in 1910, and had been consulted by Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland) {{about the use of}} troops in the 1912 Belfast riots. In October 1913 Seely sent him to report on the police in Belfast and Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for the {{separation}} from Providence was dissension over admitting Samuel Gorton and his Warwick friends to equal rights in Providence. [...] After being evicted from other places, Gorton attempted {{to join in the}} Providence government, but the Pawtuxet settlers <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of him or his followers. [...] One cause of dissatisfaction was Gorton's treatment of the Indians. [...] Arnold felt a strong affinity towards the Narragansett people, having acquired their language, and he accused Gorton and the other Warwick settlers of showing injustice to the Indians in a long letter to Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts in 1648.|$|E
500|$|Channing Tatum as Conrad S. Hauser / Duke [...] The lead soldier. Lorenzo di Bonaventura was {{originally}} interested in casting Mark Wahlberg, {{and when the}} script was rewritten into a G.I. Joe origin story, the studio offered the role to Tatum. Tatum had played a soldier in Stop-Loss, an anti-war film, and originally <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> in G.I. Joe, which he felt glorified war. The actor later detailed that he {{wound up in the}} film due to a contractual obligation with Paramount, given Tatum signed a three-picture deal following Coach Carter. Tatum was a fan of the G.I. Joe franchise while growing up, and expressed interest in playing Snake Eyes although Paramount wanted him for Duke.|$|E

500|$|Henry Wise Wood {{declined}} to seek re-election as UFA President at its 1931 convention, {{and was replaced}} by Robert Gardiner. [...] In contrast to Wood, Gardiner was firmly entrenched on the progressive movement's left-wing. [...] He denounced Brownlee's approach to economic policy, saying that his austerity only exacerbated the problem of underconsumption. [...] Under Gardiner, the UFA moved increasingly to the left, well {{out of step with the}} Brownlee government, and passed resolutions calling for the nationalization of land, radio broadcasting, and hydroelectricity, along with the cancellation of interest payments as long as the price of agricultural commodities was less than the cost of their production. [...] In 1932, prominent UFA members—including MP William Irvine—attended the founding convention of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Calgary. [...] This new federal party advocated socialism and considered itself a partnership between farmers and labourers; Brownlee <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of its policies.|$|E
500|$|After the Democratic convention, Bryan had {{returned}} triumphantly to Lincoln, making speeches along the way. [...] At home, {{he took a}} short rest, and was visited by Senator Jones to discuss plans for the campaign. [...] Bryan {{was not interested in}} campaign organization; what he wanted from the DNC was enough money to conduct a national tour by train. [...] The campaign, as it proved, was badly organized: This was Jones' first national campaign, and the party structure in many states was either only newly in the control of silver forces, or in gold states <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of the national ticket. [...] With little money, poor organization, and a hostile press, Bryan was his campaign's most important asset, and he wanted to reach the voters by traveling to them. [...] According to Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 campaign, [...] "Bryan expected that he alone, carrying to the people the message of free silver, would win the election for his party." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Jackie Gleason in How Do I Love Thee?. During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death.|$|E

With GTA, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered - you never had to hurt anybody that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 1960 season, the American League {{announced}} plans to put a team in Los Angeles. [...] Greenberg immediately became the favorite to become the new team's first owner and persuaded Veeck to join him as his partner. [...] However, when Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley got wind of these developments, he threatened to scuttle the whole deal by invoking his exclusive rights to operate a major league team in southern California. [...] In truth, O'Malley <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> of competing against an expansion team owned by a master promoter such as Veeck, {{even if he was}} only a minority partner. [...] Greenberg wouldn't budge and pulled out of the running for what became the Los Angeles Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim).

In response to the King's request for his views (the King had also written to the Prime Minister), French wrote (25 September 1913) that the army would obey [...] "the absolute commands of the King", but he warned that some might think [...] "that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks" [...] although he stressed {{that he wanted to}} act firmly against dissidents within the army. In December 1913, in his memorandum [...] "Position of the Army with Regard to the Situation in Ulster", French recommended that Captain Spender, who was openly assisting the UVF, be cashiered [...] "pour decourager les autres".|$|E
