If only I might live to see it, <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> my side!" [...] Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see [...] "his day"; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.|$|E

New York {{had a large}} Irish Catholic population, and Diệm received an even greater reception than in the capital. Diệm was taken in a seven-car motorcade to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, where Bishop Joseph Flannelly delayed the mass to await the South Vietnamese president. After leading Diệm {{to a point of}} honor in the cathedral's sanctuary, Bishop Flannelly said [...] "We are delighted and we are proud to have... His Excellency Ngô Đình Diệm. The whole world acclaimed him when this God-fearing anti-communist and courageous statesman saved Vietnam! ... our fellow Catholics join our hearts and souls <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> this altar of God." ...|$|E
500|$|McCracken starred with Eddie Dowling, {{a veteran}} Broadway actor, {{in the play}} Angel in the Pawnshop, in a 1950 tour and on Broadway in 1951. She played a young woman seeking to escape her {{marriage}} from a homicidal thief, in a pawnshop owned by Dowling's character. While in the pawnshop, she puts on old clothing and fantasizes that she is living in happier times. Although she engaged in some choreographed dancing during the play, it was a straight dramatic role. While the play was being prepared for Broadway, in October 1950, she appeared on television in the premiere of the Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, playing Essie in You Can't Take It <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>At</b> that time, McCracken gave an interview disparaging what she described as the [...] "over-commercialization" [...] of television, which might have hurt her career in the new medium. Reviews for Angel in the Pawnshop were negative, and she received mixed reviews for her performance.|$|E

The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when I do have something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> length and tell you openly how I feel. Thank you for filling my soul with melody and song … lyrics and love … and giving me a safe place I feel comforted in being brave enough to always bare my soul and come from an honest and genuine place.

It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just thanking you guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years... Standing by me, I appreciate all your support, this one is just for you". Everybody is seen joking around with another friend as they make the [...] "L" [...] sign for [...] "love" [...] with their hands, as well as holding up signs with positive messages such as [...] "Don't judge", [...] "Equality", [...] "Racism sucks", [...] "Accept", and [...] "Amo a mi hijo gay" [...] ("I love my gay son"), while Aguilera's son Bratman [...] "excitedly" [...] "shows off his dancing chops". At the end, Aguilera blows a kiss to the camera.|$|E
2500|$|During 1936, von Braun's {{rocketry}} {{team working}} at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. Ernst Heinkel enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a He-72 and later two He-112s for the experiments. Later in 1936, Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, {{because he had}} been {{recognized as one of the}} most experienced test-pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge. After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: [...] "Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air?

[...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know.

[...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E
