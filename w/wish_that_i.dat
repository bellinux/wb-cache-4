500|$|During an {{interview}} with V, Cyrus and producer Pharrell Williams revealed that they considered servicing [...] "#GetItRight" [...] as the lead single from the record, though [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] was ultimately chosen. [...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like I got no panties on / I <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could feel ya / Now hurry, hang up that damn phone!'" [...] address the desire of an [...] "absent lover". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that its production was similar to that of [...] "Starships" [...] by Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|Lodge {{compensated}} for the setback by helping secure the position of Assistant Secretary for Theodore Roosevelt, a brash and aggressive New Yorker. Long and Roosevelt did not get along: in addition to personality differences, Roosevelt pushed a view to aggressively modernize and expand the Navy against Long's more studied and conservative approach. He preferred to expand the Navy gradually. As the nation's global interests grew, Long committed himself to the nation's peaceful growth in line with McKinley's policies. As {{a result of his}} disagreements with Roosevelt, Long took steps to control his subordinate. Roosevelt, on the other hand, sought ways to spur Long into action, writing [...] "I only <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could poison his mind so as to make him a shade more truculent in international matters". He also chafed against Long's policy of deferring much of the department's work to its permanent bureau chiefs, which resulted in constraints on the flow of information the administration received. Long was somewhat {{proud of the fact that}} he knew little of the detail of naval affairs, commenting that he was [...] "a civilian who does not know the stem from the stern of a ship".|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 6, and Obama was projected the winner at about 11:14 pm Eastern Standard Time. [...] Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama's 332, losing {{all but one of}} nine battleground states, and 47percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51percent. Media accounts described Romney as [...] "shellshocked" [...] by the result. He and his senior campaign staff had disbelieved public polls showing Obama narrowly ahead, and had {{thought they were going to}} win until the vote tallies began to be reported on the evening of the election. [...] But Romney's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama's, both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology (the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application). In his concession speech to his supporters, he said, [...] "Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field. We have given our all to this campaign. I so <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead this country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader." [...] Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election, Romney attributed the outcome to Obama's having secured the votes of specific interest groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, young people, and women, by offering them what Romney called [...] "extraordinary financial gifts." [...] The remark drew heavy criticism from prominent members of the Republican party.|$|E

2500|$|Hesiod {{knew from}} the {{traditional}} poetry, such as the Iliad, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to {{the market value of}} each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so {{there must have been a}} golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: [...] "And I <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward." ...|$|E
2500|$|By then, Aderca's own {{literature}} was being assessed from an antisemitic standpoint in traditionalist circles. Const. I. Emilian, studying Romania's modernist scene with an ultra-nationalist bias, dismissed all of Aderca's texts as [...] "neurotic". The theme {{was taken up}} by Ovidiu Papadima in Sfarmă-Piatră, ridiculing Lovinescu as the unlikely patron of [...] "revolutionary ideas" [...] and of [...] "the Jews" [...] Aderca, Camil Baltazar, Benjamin Fondane, Ilarie Voronca, this being [...] "the illusion of a literary movement". Papadima campaigned for Aderca and H. Bonciu to be arrested during the 1937 scandal, referred to them only under their original Jewish names, called them [...] "swine" [...] and [...] "traders in hogwash", and suggested that erotic {{literature was}} [...] "that Jewish business". Dismissing the antisemitic lobby as [...] "hooligans", Aderca reportedly snapped: [...] "Five minutes, you understand? For five minutes, I <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> too were a hooligan, that I could experience {{what it means to}} be the Master!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The band (minus drummer William Goldsmith) {{relocated}} to Hollywood's Grandmaster Recorders in February 1997, described by Mendel as [...] "a small studio that sometimes moonlighted as a porn set, and looked the part." [...] For {{a period of}} four weeks, the band re-recorded most of the album with Grohl performing the drum tracks. It started with only [...] "Monkey Wrench" [...] as Grohl and Norton felt the drums needed more work, but eventually Goldsmith's drums remained on only two tracks, [...] "Doll" [...] and [...] "Up in Arms". According to Grohl, Goldsmith's drumming had good moments, but his performances mostly did not fit what Grohl had conceived for the drum track, so the frontman decided to redo them himself. Goldsmith even asked if he should go to Los Angeles, but Grohl dismissed this by saying he was only performing overdubs. Once Mendel told Goldsmith the situation, Grohl said that despite replacing Goldsmith's tracks, he still wanted him as a bandmember, but the disgruntled drummer {{decided to leave the}} Foo Fighters instead. Speaking about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl in 2011 said, [...] "There were a lot of reasons it didn't work out... {{but there was also a}} part of me that was like, you know, I don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet." [...] He would also state, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would have handled things differently..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kemper {{gained some}} Internet fame in August 2007 {{for her part}} in [...] "Blowjob Girl", a humor video on the sketch comedy site Derrick Comedy. The video, which was {{circulated}} on the popular site CollegeHumor, was a two-minute close-up of Kemper offering to perform oral sex on her boyfriend, but startling him by promising to bite and smash his genitals, which she seems to believe is arousing. Kemper said of the video in an April 2010 interview with The A.V. Club: [...] "I really don't like that video, and I <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn't done it, even though I know that it's a joke. I hate that it got sort of big, because I don't think that it's that funny and I don't want {{that to be the}} epitome of my work. It's just one video in a sea of many, but it has made me conscious of not wanting to do a video like that again." [...] Kemper has also contributed an article to CollegeHumor entitled [...] "Regarding Our Decision Never to See Me Again." [...] She also had a minor role in the 2009 film Mystery Team. Kemper starred in the fake iPhone commercial on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in January 2007, six months before the first iPhone was released. Kemper appeared in the Sofia Coppola comedy-drama Somewhere in 2010. She appeared in Bridesmaids in 2011. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Kemper would be voicing a character in an episode of the animated sitcom American Dad!.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1906, {{with his}} cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their {{neighbour}} in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note [...] "Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun-running conspiracy." [...] (p23). At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both {{came very close}} to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case. In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, [...] as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain’s Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this hospitality, at great expense and risk on Atul’s side: [...] "We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. I have very often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could all work together. Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his <b>wish</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> met Jatin Mukherjee…". Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, [...] "some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India." [...] Atul’s elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.|$|E
