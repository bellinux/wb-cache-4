She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak or too strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E
25|$|Although World War I {{was already}} a few years ago, its {{economic}} impact was not yet over.

The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named 1ère classe (first class), the professionals, and 2ème classe (second class), the amateurs.|$|E

25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought have emerged {{surrounding}} several key questions surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> why it began in the first place, and what it was. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition {{by a series of}} grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal {{at the beginning of the}} movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.|$|E
25|$|From the 2017–18 season, the Indian Super League {{will run}} from November to March.

Despite the {{increased number of}} teams, the finals will still run the same <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> previous seasons. Prior to the 2017–18 season, the league ran from October to December. The regular season would begin in October and end by early December while the finals would take place {{within the next two}} to three weeks. The regular season would be fourteen matches long, with each team playing each other twice. The top four sides at the end qualify for the finals. The first round of the finals sees the first placed team take on the fourth placed team while the second placed team faces the third.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the Sultan's, then take a seat in front of her. She would give them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E

Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences {{to get what they}} want.

Later versions of the Attorney General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations, widely emulated by other federal agencies, show some changes in language from those published before Jacobson. [...] "Entrapment should be avoided", became [...] "entrapment must be avoided", and investigators were told it must be apparent to them that the activity they were investigating was illegal, rather than just corrupt. A definition of entrapment was included that used the same language as the decision.|$|E

Camitz was hired on Fuller's recommendation because of his commercials for Volkswagen, Diesel, and Nike. His original concept for the video was a one-take shoot of the group arriving at an exotic building in Barcelona, taking over the place, and running a riot—the same <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> when {{they were looking for}} a manager and a record company. A few days before the shoot on 19 April 1996, Camitz was unable to get permission to use the building, and the shoot was relocated to the Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London.|$|E

500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history. If things hadn't turned out the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> at that particular point, the world that we live in now would be very different." [...] He decided {{to tell the story of}} the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman {{placed an}} ad in the paper asking if people who {{recently}} lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified [...] "documentary" [...] in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been. The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film. The interviews ran for about ten minutes on {{what it is like to}} lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would [...] "fire" [...] them on camera and ask them to either respond the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.|$|E
500|$|Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was glad}} to see Ben and Leslie come {{together}} the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> particularly because he feared the no-dating rule would become an [...] "artificial barrier" [...] that dragged out the romance subplot. Porter also praised Rob Lowe's performance, and said it made the character likeable even as he kept Leslie and Ben apart. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "stellar" [...] episode that was [...] "loose, silly, rich with details and heart". While he said the episode included good [...] "outrageous comedy", he said the script strives on the more subtle scenes about Leslie and Ben coming together, along with Chris' constant interruptions. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic was underwhelmed by the Know Ya Boo story, but strongly praised Leslie and Ben's scenes, which he said were both touching and very funny. He particularly praised the way [...] scene when Ben describes his feelings for Leslie through his description to the baseball tournament panel about why he loves Pawnee.|$|E

500|$|Billy Mays, a {{television}} advertisement salesman, {{is the first}} dead celebrity featured in the episode, and plays {{a large role in}} the early part of the script. Mays' son, Billy Mays III, a self-proclaimed South Park fan, said he loved [...] "Dead Celebrities", and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. He said, [...] "South Park gets a little edgy sometimes, but at their core, they're just social satire, you know? I think it was natural for them to do a dead celebrities episode with this whole summer and how it's been, and I think the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it was pretty tasteful for the most part." [...] The spirit of David Carradine is shown wearing lingerie and with a noose around his neck, a reference to his June 3, 2009, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Among the others featured in the episode were actress Farrah Fawcett, journalist Walter Cronkite, disc jockey Adam Goldstein (DJ AM), politician Ted Kennedy, actress Beatrice Arthur, television personality Ed McMahon, actor Patrick Swayze, actress Natasha Richardson, hot dog magnate Oscar G.

500|$|In 2016, Disclosure had {{developed}} their skills of writing songs while on tour, {{but did not}} have time to produce enough material for a full-length album. Regardless, the duo wanted to release a record for the summer, reasoning that they felt [...] "strange" [...] not issuing any material to the public in that season. Therefore, they created and distributed a three-track [...] "clubby" [...] extended play that went [...] "back to the start." [...] Moog for Love was Disclosure's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy Napes, which Howard said also [...] "feels quite strange." [...] With the EP, Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from what they used for making their previous records, Settle (2013) and Caracal (2015), reasoning that they would be making the same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way. However, they still had made songs in one similar <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> for Settle, in that there was some material only one of the members would work on, and after the song was finished, both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album.|$|E
