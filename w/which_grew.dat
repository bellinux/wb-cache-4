5|$|British Columbia has 50district {{municipalities}} {{that had}} a cumulative population of770,148 in the 2016 Census. British Columbia's largest and smallest district municipalities are Langley and Wells with populations of 117,285 and 217 respectively. The fastest-growing district municipality in British Columbia is Invermere, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> 14.8% between 2011 and 2016, while the fastest-shrinking is Tumbler Ridge, which shrunk by 26.7%.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} subspecies, Ranunculus bullatus subsp. bullatus (L.) <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in the Iberian Peninsula, France and Italy; Ranunculus bullatus subsp. cytheraeus (Halácsy) <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> {{in the eastern}} Mediterranean {{including}} Libya; and Ranunculus bullatus subsp. supranudus (Jordan & Fourr.) <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.|$|R
50|$|This {{mushroom}} {{is often}} mistaken for Gymnopilus luteocarneus <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> on conifers {{and has a}} smoother and darker cap. Another lookalike is Gymnopilus penetrans <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in the same habitat and has minor microscopic differences.|$|R
50|$|Commensalism {{is similar}} to facilitation, in that one plant is mostly {{exploiting}} another. A familiar example is the ephiphytes <b>which</b> <b>grow</b> on branches of tropical trees, or even mosses <b>which</b> <b>grow</b> on trees in deciduous forests.|$|R
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Okonkwo {{struggles with the}} legacy of his father– a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute– {{as well as the}} {{complications}} and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia. Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes of his earlier stories, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> from his own background.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of Red mahogany; E. resinifera subs. resinifera, <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> {{north from}} Jervis Bay to the Mid North Coast of New South Wales; and E. resinifera subs. hemilampra, <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> north from Kempsey.|$|R
5|$|Several {{other species}} are edible, but not commercially {{cultivated}} to any significant extent. These include the cold-tolerant Siberian hazelnut (C. heterophylla), C. kweichowensis, <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in the warmer parts of China, C. sieboldiana, <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in Japan and China, and other minor Corylus species.|$|R

5|$|Lillestrøm SK {{originally}} used Jenseberg Stadion in Strømmen {{for their}} matches, {{as there was}} no suitable stadium in Lillestrøm. On 6 June 1920, the municipality opened Lillestrøm Stadion, where Lillestrøm SK moved their matches. In 1930, the club started working on plans for their own stadium. Led by the chairman Erling Nicolaysen, a stadium fund was established, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> to NOK200. However, during the Second World War, the club's funds eradicated.|$|E
5|$|Outside of cricket, Barnes {{followed}} his mother into property development (see above) and {{at various times}} entered into partnerships with Keith Miller and Norman Von Nida. His suspicious nature, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> as time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.|$|E
5|$|The DWK's {{increasingly}} centralised administration {{resulted in}} {{a substantial increase in}} its staffing level, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> from about 5000 employees in mid-1948 to 10,000 by the beginning of 1949. In March 1949, Rau, like the representative of a state, signed a first treaty with a foreign state, a trade agreement with Poland.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} severe adverse reactions, {{including}} vomiting and fever, in about 10% of the population, {{but this is}} now {{thought to be a}} result of confusion with morphologically identical species such as Laetiporus huroniensis <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> on hemlock trees, and L. gilbertsonii <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> on Eucalyptus.|$|R

5|$|Tom Peterson (February 23, 1930– July 25, 2016) was an American retailer, pitchman, and {{television}} personality from Portland, Oregon. Peterson opened his first store in 1964, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> to a regional consumer electronics, home appliance, and furniture chain in the 1970s. His memorable television commercials and unusual promotions {{made him a}} widely recognized personality in the Portland area by the 1980s, leading to several cameo appearances in the films of Gus Van Sant.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg was {{the largest}} city in Jutland until it was surpassed by Aarhus in the mid-19th century. In 1672, it had 4,181 inhabitants, growing slowly during the 18th century, with 4,425 in 1769, 4,866 in 1787 and 5,579 by 1801. By 1845, there were 7,477 inhabitants, {{increasing}} to 10,069 by 1860. Dramatic growth {{began in the late}} 19th century, with an increase from 14,152 in 1880 to 31,457 in 1901. By 1930, the population had grown to 59,091, although the figure was boosted by the merging of Nørre Tranders, Rørdal Fabriksby, Øster Sundby and Øster Uttrup into Aalborg. In 1950, it reached 87,883, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> to 100,587 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
50|$|Agrostis canina is a {{perennial}} plant, with stolons but no rhizomes, and culms <b>which</b> <b>grow</b> to {{a height of}} up to 75 cm. It is frequently confused with Agrostis vinealis (formerly treated as a subspecies or variety of A. canina), <b>which</b> <b>grows</b> in more upland habitats and has rhizomes rather than stolons.|$|R

5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was {{a major influence on}} house music, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in preaching to the European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both secular and religious studies. The first class had ten students, a total <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a government-funded school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry {{had been}} {{included}} in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed {{for the attention of}} poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.|$|E

5|$|From {{around the}} 1950s onwards, {{breeding}} resumed in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. New plants were produced by crossing among the species and existing cultivars of S. truncata, S. russelliana and the hybrid S. × buckleyi. Treatments which induced mutations were also used. The {{result was a}} wide range of flower colours which had not been available before, including the first true yellow to be sold commercially, S. 'Gold Charm' (which was a sterile triploid). Breeders aimed for plants <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> strongly, were upright at the point of sale rather than pendulous, had many flowers or buds, and were adapted to living as house plants.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th to 20th century, it {{was home}} to Vine Street Police Station, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> from a watch-house {{into one of the}} busiest police {{stations}} in the world. The Marquess of Queensberry was charged with libel against Oscar Wilde here in 1895. There was also a court house in the 18th and early 19th century. The street's association with law has led to it being grouped with Bow Street and Marlborough Street on the standard British Monopoly board.|$|E
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, <b>which</b> <b>grew</b> wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
