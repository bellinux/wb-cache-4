50|$|The {{evidence}} is conflicting on {{what time of}} day they <b>are</b> <b>active.</b> David A.

The flies are airborne for only three to five days before expiring.|$|R
5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees <b>were</b> <b>active.</b> From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

All Dolgorsüren brothers have strong backgrounds in Mongolian wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Barði Guðmundsson {{identified}} the Kylfings as an East Scandinavian, possibly Swedish, tribe that infiltrated northern Norway {{during the late}} ninth century. Guðmundsson connects the Kylfings with the Germanic Heruli who <b>were</b> <b>active</b> throughout northern Europe and in Italy during the fifth and sixth centuries. According to Guðmundsson, many of these Kylfings may ultimately have emigrated to Iceland during the ninth and tenth centuries. Other scholars have assigned a Danish origin to this tribe.|$|E

50|$|Crepuscular {{animals are}} those that <b>are</b> <b>active</b> {{primarily}} during twilight (that is, the periods of dawn and dusk). This is distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior, where an animal <b>is</b> <b>active</b> during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness, respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also <b>be</b> <b>active</b> on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that <b>are</b> <b>active</b> only before sunrise, and vespertine for those active only after sunset.|$|R

5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs <b>were</b> <b>active,</b> but would respond if more than one <b>were</b> <b>active.</b> This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they <b>were</b> <b>active</b> swimmers.|$|E

The American forces received supplies and logistical support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, {{cyclones}} <b>were</b> <b>active</b> for a total of 40days, and severe tropical cyclones <b>were</b> <b>active</b> for a total of 19days, both above average. A total of five tropical disturbances formed during 2002, of which two were cyclones. The first disturbance of the season, Tropical Depression 17F, along with another depression, 01F, formed well {{before the start of the}} cyclone season on July 3 and October 21 respectively. Cyclone Yolande was the first cyclone of the season, forming on November 29, but did not impact any land masses. In December, two disturbances formed, Tropical Depression 03F and Cyclone Zoe. The latter was the season's strongest cyclone and the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, affecting areas of the Solomon Islands.|$|E
