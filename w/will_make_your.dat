500|$|Richard Cantillon {{amassed a}} great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early {{and selling them}} at {{inflated}} prices. Cantillon's financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours. Cantillon replied: [...] "I shall not go away; but I <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> system succeed." [...] To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator Joseph Gage formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the final design of Indefatigable was approved, the Admiralty was already moving on, Fisher writing in September 1908 [...] "I've got Sir Philip Watts into a new Indomitable that <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> mouth water when you see it", a design that was to {{eventually}} emerge as [...] In August 1909 the self-governing dominions met at the 1909 Imperial Conference, and in discussion of Imperial defence, the Admiralty proposed the creation of indigenous fleet units, each to consist of one Invincible-class battlecruiser, three light cruisers of the Bristol class, and six destroyers. These were to be based in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa in attempt to secure the naval defence of the Dominions while the Royal Navy concentrated in home waters to meet the German threat. While the scheme was rejected by Canada and South Africa, Australia and New Zealand subscribed, each ordering {{a modified version of}} the Indefatigable, rather than the originally proposed Invincible class. Australia became a ship of the newly formed Royal Australian Navy, while New Zealand was retained in European waters as a wholly RN unit. Eventually, only one fleet unit was formed, the Australian squadron in 1913.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Five Days at Memorial were mostly positive. Jason Berry of The New York Times commended the [...] "shimmering intelligence" [...] of Fink's {{discussion}} of the events and their ethical issues, and summarized the book as [...] "social reporting of the first rank". Another New York Times critic, bioethicist Sherwin B. Nuland, felt the book displayed [...] "masterly reporting and the glow of fine writing" [...] and offered particular praise for the tone and language of Fink's writing. The Independent Hirsh Sawhney admired the detail and variety of perspectives offered {{in the book and}} described the book as [...] "soar to artistic and intellectual heights undreamed of in other realms of media". Peter Beaumont, writing for The Guardian, found parts of the book awkward in structure, but felt that overall it was [...] "tight, provocative and gripping" [...] with a [...] "fair and deeply sympathetic" [...] approach to the involved parties. A review by John B. Saul in The Seattle Times commended Fink's ability to produce a [...] "compelling and revealing account" [...] of events despite limited access to evidence such as investigative reports and Pou's testimony, while the Star Tribune Curt Schleier described Five Days at Memorial as [...] "an important book that <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> blood boil no matter which side of the issue you support".|$|E
500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was a little kid and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> flight ahead of other competitors. It would be nice, if the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{characters}} in the series are derived from mythological creatures. In some cases the creatures themselves appeared, and in other cases a character was designed to incorporate the characteristics of a mythological creature. Stories and situations made use of these mythological elements to create jokes and draw comparisons with the original mythology. For example, the Oni choose tag to decide their contest with Earth because the Japanese word for Tag, Onigokko, means [...] "game of the Oni". When Ataru grabs Lum's horns during their contest and she misunderstands his statement that he can get married, it is a reference to the myth that grabbing the horns of an Oni <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> dream come true.|$|E

Gone Girl, the Times {{goes on to}} say, is Flynn's [...] "dazzling breakthrough," [...] {{adding that}} the novel is [...] "wily, mercurial, subtly layered and populated by characters so well imagined that theyâ€™re hard to part with." [...] A USA Today review focuses on bookseller enthusiasm for the book, quoting a Jackson, Mississippi store manager saying, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> head spin off." [...] People Magazines review found the novel [...] "a delectable summer read" [...] that burrows [...] "deep into the murkiest corners of the human psyche." [...] A Chatelaine review commends the novel's suspense, its intricately detailed plot {{and the way it}} keeps the reader [...] "unnervingly off balance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christian Music Zine's Tyler Hess {{said that}} [...] "Now, {{after all these}} years, with new members, they have finally {{released}} the album that actually sounds like a successor to 2005â€²s Disciple, adding {{a little bit of}} the radio friendliness from their most recent release, in the form of O God Save Us All." [...] Hess wrote that he had [...] "...to admit that Iâ€™d much rather hear the more aggressive side of Disciple than the ballads, but there isnâ€™t a bad track on the album, even if itâ€™s on the softer side as a whole. They know what works for them and what their audience wants, if youâ€™re cool with it not having the edginess of the old days, then O God Save Us All <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> ears happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{studied for}} a year in Milan with the soprano Adelaide Saraceni, but her most {{important}} teacher was the London-based tenor Eduardo Asquez. She made her debut as Frasquita in Bizet's Carmen in Salzburg with the Landestheatre Opera Company, where she spent a season in 1963 singing roles in Italian, French and German operas. [...] The following year, she returned to England, performing in concerts, including two Promenade Concerts with Sir Malcolm Sargent. She later recalled, [...] "I remember Sir Malcolm Sargent plucking {{me out of the}} Royal College of Music to do some Proms as a student â€“ can you imagine that happening nowadays? â€“ and saying to me 'Your quiet singing <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> fortune'". The music critics commended [...] "a team of soloists led by a newcomer, Miss Valerie Masterson, with particularly pure and radiant soprano tone" [...] in the Serenade to Music.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Calm Ahern was more {{negative}} about the game's intention {{to capitalize on}} people's nostalgia, noting that the game [...] "aggressively captured both the bad {{as well as the}} good: camera issues, ambiguous puzzles, a distinct lack of signposting, and voices that <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> ears bleed", while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience. Furthermore, while he was positive about the first level, he claimed that all other levels in the game were falling short, finding them repetitive and confusing. Chelsea Stark of Polygon noted that Yooka-Laylee was [...] "proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past." [...] She called the game's combat mechanics [...] "a chore" [...] and was critical of the controls. Gamesradar also noted the game's repetitive missions and objectives, with reviewer David Houghton noting that some of the game's power-ups, especially the flight ability, render most puzzles obsolete.|$|E

2500|$|Hence, in {{the general}} law of contract, {{negotiating}} parties {{have a duty to}} not make false statements of fact or law, or misrepresent themselves through conduct. Statements of opinion, [...] "mere puff" [...] or vague [...] "sales talk" [...] (e.g. [...] "this washing powder <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> clothes whiter than white!"), are generally not considered factual. However representations of people who profess special skill or knowledge {{are more likely to be}} actionable, as they warrant their opinions are based on concrete facts. So in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR held that Esso's expert opinion that a petrol station would have 200,000 gallons worth of business was an actionable misrepresentation. If someone is induced to enter a contract by any misrepresentation, whether fraudulent, negligent or innocent, they are entitled to rescind the contract and get back the property they have conveyed. As a remedy originating in the courts of equity, this right to rescind could be lost, in four situations that courts regard as unfair to allow a claim. First, if a claimant takes too long to claim, the lapse of time (or [...] "laches") will create a bar to rescission. Second, if a claimant affirms a contract by expressly showing they still consent to a deal even though they are aware of a misrepresentation, rescission is barred. Third, if a third party's rights have intervened, when that third party is a bona fide purchaser rescission will be barred to the extent that property cannot be recovered from the third party (although a claim in damages can still exist against the misrepresentor). Fourth, and important in practice to prevent unjust enrichment is that counter-restitution must be possible. There is confusion over whether in cases at law, rather than in equity, counter-restitution must be precise (i.e. a thing received must be given back [...] ) or whether, as in Erlanger, substantial counter-restitution may be in money.|$|E
