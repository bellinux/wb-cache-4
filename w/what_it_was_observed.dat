40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{efficiency of}} a high silica zeolite Y towards sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide antibiotic, was evaluated {{in the presence of}} two humic monomers, vanillin and caffeic acid, representative of phenolic compounds usually occurring in water bodies, owing their dimension comparable to those of the zeolite microporosity. In the entire range of investigated pH (5 - 8), adsorption of vanillin, as a single component, was reversible whereas it was irreversible for sulfamethoxazole. In equimolar ternary mixtures, vanillin coadsorbed with sulfamethoxazole, conversely to what observed for caffeic acid, accordingly to their adsorption kinetics and pKa values. Lower and higher adsorptions were observed for sulfamethoxazole and vanillin, respectively, than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> as single components, clearly revealing guest-guest interactions. An adduct formed through H-bonding between the carbonyl oxygen of vanillin and the heterocycle NH of sulfamethoxazole in amide form was observed in the zeolite pore by combined FTIR and Rietveld analysis, in agreement with Density Functional Theory calculations of the adduct stabilization energies. The formation of similar adducts, able to stabilize other naturally occurring phenolic compounds in the microporosities of hydrophobic sorbents, was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Values of {{leachate}} {{production in}} the urban solid waste landfill of La Mina (Marbella) are certainly an unknown parameter, because of its uncontrolled situation. It has been necessary an estimation {{of the volume of}} leachate with the application of a water balance. For doing so, the inflow (precipitation) and outflows of water (evaporation, infiltration to the aquifer and discharge to the surface) have been recognized. A daily calculation of evapotranspiration jointly with the recorded daily rainfall and the areal surface of the landfill yielded the total volume of water (i. e. : leachate) produced during the study period (October 1994 - September 1999). The annual average is between 26. 087 m 3 and 28. 706 m 3, with absolute values of 50. 000 m 3 in wet years and less than 1. 000 m 3 in dry years. For the research period the whole amount of leachate has been estimated in a range between 143. 530 m 3 (0 ’ 8 L/s) and 130. 434 m 3 (0 ’ 9 L/s). Temporal evolution of leachate generation with values from the water balance method do not reflect leachate production in dry years and/or months, but this statement differs slightly with <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in the field, because during dry periods a constant drainage of leachate (0 ’ 1 - 0 ’ 5 L/s) is produced.

40|$|CSA (Calcium SulfoAluminate) cements {{may have}} {{variable}} compositions {{but all of}} them contain ye’elimite(Ca 4 Al 6 O 12 SO 4). The manufacture of CSA cements is more environmentally friendly than that of ordinary Portland cements as their production releases up to 40 % less CO 2. The hydration of ye’elimite leads to crystalline ettringite (AFt) and amorphous aluminum hydroxide (AH 3 •nH 2 O). Ptychographic X-ray computed nanotomography (PXCT) has been used here to study the hydration of ye’elimite-containing samples. PXCT is an X-ray imaging technique having demonstrated an isotropic 3 D resolution better than 20 nm[1]. PXCT, which nondestructively provides 3 D images of the sample complex-valued X-ray refractive index, has been recently applied for hydration studies of Portland cement samples[2]. Samples for this study were measured in cSAXS beamline (Swiss Light Source). The main goal of this study has been the quantification of the electron and mass densities of the phases present in these samples. These mass densities were compared with the theoretical values in order to identify the phases and matched well the expected values. For instance, the hydration of pure ye’elimite with gypsum sample was studied. This sample should show a large amount of AFt due to the presence of gypsum in the hydration medium. This is precisely <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> from the analysis of the histogram. Figure 1 shows the tomogram of one slice obtained for this sample. The most relevant results for CSA cement hydration will be discussed. A volume of interest (VOI) histogram has been studied in order to identify all the phases. Figure 2 shows a comparison between the histogram obtained in this study and a previous one performed by Gastaldi et al. (2012) at TOMCAT Beamline (Swiss Light Source). As it can be observed, TOMCAT data cannot properly distinguish between AFt and ye'elimite phase. Conversely, PXCT technique can resolve the peaks for all the phases present in CSA cements. All reconstructions have been successful and now we are analyzing the data (segmentation, etc.) to characterize the porosities and the shape and size of the different phase, chiefly ettringite.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar o perfil de aquisição dos arquifonemas /N, L, S, R/ em posição de coda medial e final no Português Brasileiro em estudo {{transversal}} e longitudinal. MÉTODOS: Foram coletadas e analisadas do ponto de vista fonológico, amostras de fala de 170 crianças entre um ano e dois meses e três anos e oito meses de idade (estudo transversal), e de uma criança, G., acompanhada de um ano, um mês e vinte e dois dias até três anos, quatro meses e vinte e sete dias de idade (estudo longitudinal). RESULTADOS: No perfil transversal os dados obtidos mostraram a emergência precoce da sílaba travada (aos um ano e dois meses), com a aquisição completada aos três anos e oito meses. Os fonemas em coda final tenderam a emergir antes dos fonemas em coda medial, com poucas exceções. Os /L/ e o /N/ foram os primeiros sons nessa posição. Em seguida, observou-se a aquisição de /S/ e, por último, a de /R/. No panorama longitudinal a coda também emergiu cedo, coincidentemente ao um ano e dois meses, porém estava adquirida seis meses antes do que foi observado nos dados transversais, aos três anos e oito meses. A sílaba emergente continha o /N/ ao invés do /L/, como nos dados transversais. O /L/ foi o segundo fonema em coda, enquanto o /S/ continuou sendo mais precoce do que /R/, sendo esses dois fonemas os últimos segmentos a emergir como travamento silábico. Em todos os casos, os fonemas em coda final emergiram antes da coda medial, semelhante aos resultados transversais. CONCLUSÃO: A aquisição da coda mostrou padrões semelhantes, independente do tipo de estudo - longitudinal ou transversal. PURPOSE: To {{identify the}} acquisition {{profiles of the}} archiphonemes /N, L, S, R/ in medial and final coda position in Brazilian Portuguese in transversal and longitudinal studies. METHODS: Speech samples of 170 children with ages between one year and two months and three years and eight months (transversal study), as well as speech samples of a child, G., monitored from one year, one month and twenty two days to three years, four months and twenty seven days (longitudinal study), were collected and phonologically analyzed. RESULTS: In the transversal profile, data showed the early emergence of the blocked syllable (at one year and two months), and completion of the acquisition at three years and eight months. The phonemes in final coda tended to emerge before the ones in medial coda, with rare exceptions. The /L/ and the /N/ archiphonemes {{were the first to}} emerge in this position.

40|$|Numerous {{geological}} {{features that}} could be evaporitic in origin have been identified {{on the surface of}} Titan. Although they seem to be water-ice poor, their main properties -chemical composition, thickness, stratification- are essentially unknown. In this paper, which follows on a previous one focusing on the surface composition (Cordier et al., 2013), we provide some answers to these questions derived from a new model. This model, based on the up-to-date thermodynamic theory known as "PC-SAFT", has been validated with available laboratory measurements and specifically developed for our purpose. 1 -D models confirm the possibility of an acetylene and/or butane enriched central layer of evaporitic deposit. The estimated thickness of this acetylene-butane layer could explain the strong RADAR brightness of the evaporites. The 2 -D computations indicate an accumulation of poorly soluble species at the deposit's margin. Among these species, HCN or aerosols similar to tholins could play a dominant role. Our model predicts the existence of chemically trimodal "bathtub rings" which <b>is</b> consistent with <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> at the south polar lake Ontario Lacus.

Interestingly, a few mammal species, including the silvery mole-rat Heliophobius argenteocinereus, {{are able to}} replace their dentition {{by the addition of}} supernumerary molars at the back of jaw migrating then toward the front. The aim here was to demonstrate the potential interest of further studying this rodent in order to better understand the origins of continuous dental replacement in mammals, which could also provide interesting data concerning the evolution of limited dental generation occurring in first mammals. In the present study, we described the main stages of the dental erup-tive sequence in the silvery mole-rat and the associated characteristics of horizontal replacement using X-ray microtomography. This was coupled to the investigation of other African mole-rats which have no dental replacement. This method permitted to establish evidence that the initial development of the dentition in Heliophobius <b>is</b> comparable to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> in most of African mole-rats.

We also noticed that two groups of extinct non-mammalian synapsids convergently acquired this dental mechanism, but in a way differing from extant mammals. The discussion on the diverse evolutionary origins of horizontal dental replacement put emphasis on the necessity of focusing on biological parameters potentially involved in both continuous and limited developments of teeth in mammals.

40|$|Abstract The {{motions of}} wheeled mobile robots are largely governed by contact forces between the wheels and the terrain. Inasmuch as future wheel-terrain {{interactions}} are unpredictable and unobservable, high performance autonomous vehicles must ultimately learn the terrain by feel and extrapolate, just as humans do. We present {{an approach to}} the automatic calibration of dynamic models of arbitrary wheeled mobile robots on arbitrary terrain. Inputs beyond our control (disturbances) are assumed to <b>be</b> responsible for <b>observed</b> differences between what the vehicle was initially predicted to do and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> subsequently <b>observed</b> to do. In departure from much previous work, {{and in order to}} directly support adaptive and predictive controllers, we concentrate on the problem of predicting candidate trajectories rather than measuring the current slip. The approach linearizes the nominal vehicle model and then calibrates the perturbative dynamics to explain the observed prediction residuals. Both systematic and stochastic disturbances are used, and we model these disturbances as functions over the terrain, the velocities, and the applied inertial and gravitational forces. In this way, we produce a model which can be used to predict behavior across all of state space for arbitrary terrain geometry. Results demonstrate that the approach converges quickly and produces marked improvements in the prediction of trajectories for multiple vehicle classes throughout the performance envelope of the platform, including during aggressive maneuvering. ...|$|R

In his criticism of capitalism, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon believed that the emphasis on private property is the problem.

The art institution, despite inviting O’Reilly to perform the work, demonstrated their fears at showing ‘risky’ work through a process which aimed to sanction the ‘health’ of the artwork and subsequently its reflections on the artist herself. They asked O’Reilly to respond to various health and safety demands to account for her mental state and bodily health to prove that she was ‘safe’ to perform 2. In asking her to conform to their demands they were making both internal and public assurances that the work was art and not the product of catharsis or breakdown. The institutional unease that O’Reilly could be acting out a psychiatric or psychological disorder through ‘Wet Cup’ demonstrated the sense of mistrust the performing body can instill. Kira O’Reilly’s experience follows a tradition within performance art that inflicts physical pain or suffering. In situating the physical or psychological transgressive within easy and ‘live’ grasp this type of practice presents the performing body as a confrontation to be negotiated.

In addition, they recommended the adoption of percentages of up to 2 % for each of these parameters in defining <b>what</b> <b>is</b> material. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed,</b> as well, especially with respect to the effectiveness of internal control and to public expectations or interests, that qualitative aspects should be also taken into account in determining materiality, although a lesser degree of importance is attributed to this than to the quantitative aspects,. The study contributes to the accounting literature on the development of audits, particularly with respect to the use of a concept, materiality, that is always emphasized in professional standards, but about which there are few objective guidelines...|$|R

The media constantly remind us of the possibility of an object suddenly appearing and hitting Earth. A hit by an asteroid is believed to have spelled the end of the dinosaurs. Such a collision by an object from space could cause another extinction event, if the object were large enough. And such objects are definitely out there. Often called “the vermin of the sky,” asteroids roam our Solar System often unseen. Many have been tracked, and their orbits calculated. But there are still many to be discovered and assessed. Many amateur astronomers are helping in this effort, sometimes even working with professional astronomers, to contribute to our knowledge and avert danger. Some people just enjoying locating these or the dwarf planets, such as Pluto, and then following their paths. Whatever your interest, Asteroids and Dwarf Planets and How to Observe Them will help you get started. It will tell you what you are looking at and why you should look.

Every amateur astronomer sees "stars" that aren't natural objects steadily slide across the background of the sky. Artificial satellites can be seen on any night, and some are as bright as the planets. But can you identify which satellite or spent launch vehicle casing you are seeing? Do you know how to image it? Artificial Satellites and How to Observe Them describes all of the different satellites that can <b>be</b> <b>observed,</b> including communication, scientific, spy satellites, and of course, the International Space Station. Richard Schmude describes how to recognize them and even how to predict their orbits. The book tells how to observe artificial satellites with the unaided eye, binoculars and with telescopes. Many images of artificial satellites taken from Earth are included. Artificial satellites have changed since the beginning of the twenty-first century. Several additional countries have launched them. And amateur astronomers have utilized digital cameras to image satellites to a resolution of about 1 meter. Readers of astronomy magazines are aware of these developments but will want to get the complete story. Here <b>it</b> <b>is!</b> Artificial Satellites and How to <b>Observe</b> Them <b>is</b> a detailed and up-to-date overview of artificial satellites.

40|$|In {{homicide}} cases, <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> {{difficult to}} prove {{the cause of death}} if the body of the victim of an alleged murderous attack is not made available for medical examination. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> therefore obvious that there are instances and circumstances where persons accused of committing the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death take steps to destroy the body of their victims in order to avoid prosecution or conviction and punishment if prosecuted. It would seem that the legal perception and meaning of the body of the deceased in homicide cases otherwise called “corpus delicti” is largely misconstrued by lawyers and laymen alike. This paper examined this identified problem and attempted to correct same and also considered the importance of “corpus delicti” in criminal trials generally and in homicide cases in particular. It also considered the importance and relevance of the legal presumption of death which is of evidential value in both civil and criminal proceedings in bridging the gap that may be created by the absence of corpus delicti. The views of the courts in some decided cases to the effect that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not in all homicide cases that the prosecution case may fail simply because the body of the deceased was not produced or medically examined, <b>was</b> challenged and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> argued that conviction in homicide cases {{in the absence of the}} corpus delicti can only be sustained where evidence of its destruction by the accused is established and this may also require the production of some parts or pieces of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> destroyed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> that corpus delicti and causation are twin legal concepts in criminal law constituting the physical element (octus reus) of result offences, such as culpable homicide punishable with death, with the result that one cannot exist in isolation from the other without a resultant miscarriage of justice.

40|$|The active use of {{macroeconomic}} policies to smooth economic fluctuations and, as a consequence, the stance that policymakers should adopt over the business cycle, remain controversial {{issues in the}} economic literature. In {{the light of the}} dramatic experience of the early 1930 s’ Great Depression, Keynes (1936) argued that the market mechanism could not be relied upon to spontaneously recover from a slump, and advocated counter-cyclical public spending and monetary policy to stimulate demand. Albeit the Keynesian doctrine had largely influenced policymaking during the two decades following World War II, <b>it</b> began to <b>be</b> seriously challenged in several directions {{since the start of the}} 1970 s. The introduction of rational expectations within macroeconomic models implied that aggregate demand management could not stabilize the economy’s responses to shocks (see in particular Sargent and Wallace (1975)). According to this view, in fact, rational agents foresee the effects of the implemented policies, and wage and price expectations are revised upwards accordingly. Therefore, real wages and money balances remain constant and so does output. Within such a conceptual framework, only unexpected policy interventions would have some short-run effects upon the economy. The "real business cycle (RBC) theory", pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1982), offered an alternative explanation on the nature of fluctuations in economic activity, viewed as reflecting the efficient responses of optimizing agents to exogenous sources of fluctuations, outside the direct control of policymakers. The normative implication was that there should be no role for economic policy activism: fiscal and monetary policy should be acyclical. The latest generation of New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models builds on rigorous foundations in intertemporal optimizing behavior by consumers and firms inherited from the RBC literature, but incorporates some frictions in the adjustment of nominal and real quantities in response to macroeconomic shocks (see Woodford (2003)). In such a framework, not only policy "surprises" may have an impact on the economic activity, but also the way policymakers "systematically" respond to exogenous sources of fluctuation plays a fundamental role in affecting the economic activity, thereby rekindling interest in the use of counter-cyclical stabilization policies to fine tune the business cycle. Yet, despite impressive advances in the economic theory and econometric techniques, there are no definitive answers on the systematic stance policymakers should follow, and on the effects of {{macroeconomic policies}} upon the economy. Against this background, the present thesis attempts to inspect the interrelations between macroeconomic policies and the economic activity from novel angles. Three contributions are proposed. In the first Chapter, I show that relying on the information actually available to policymakers when budgetary decisions are taken is of fundamental importance for the assessment of the cyclical stance of governments. In the second, I explore whether the effectiveness of fiscal shocks in spurring the economic activity has declined since the beginning of the 1970 s. In the third, the impact of systematic monetary policies over U. S. industrial sectors is investigated. In the existing literature, empirical assessments of the historical stance of policymakers over the economic cycle have been mainly drawn from the estimation of "reduced-form" policy reaction functions (see in particular Taylor (1993) and Galì and Perotti (2003)). Such rules typically relate a policy instrument (a reference short-term interest rate or an indicator of discretionary fiscal policy) to a set of explanatory variables (notably inflation, the output gap and the debt-GDP ratio, as long as fiscal policy is concerned). Although these policy rules can be seen as simple approximations of what derived from an explicit optimization problem solved by social planners (see Kollmann (2007)), they received considerable attention since they proved to track the behavior of central banks and fiscal policymakers relatively well. Typically, revised data, i. e. observations available to the econometrician when the study is carried out, are used in the estimation of such policy reaction functions. However, data available in "real-time" to policymakers may end up to be remarkably different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> ex-post. Orphanides (2001), in an innovative and thought-provoking paper on the U. S. monetary policy, challenged the way policy evaluation was conducted that far by showing that unrealistic assumptions about the timeliness of data availability may yield misleading descriptions of historical policy. In the spirit of Orphanides (2001), in the first Chapter of this thesis I reconsider how the intentional cyclical stance of fiscal authorities should be assessed. Importantly, in the framework of fiscal policy rules, not only variables such as potential output and the output gap are subject to measurement errors, but also the main discretionary "operating instrument" in the hands of governments: the structural budget balance, i. e. the headline government balance net of the effects due to automatic stabilizers. In fact, the actual realization of planned fiscal measures may depend on several factors (such as the growth rate of GDP, the implementation lags that often follow the adoption of many policy measures, and others more) outside the direct and full control of fiscal authorities. Hence, there might be sizeable differences between discretionary fiscal measures as planned in the past and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> ex-post. To <b>be</b> noted, this does not apply to monetary policy since central bankers can control their operating interest rates with great accuracy. When the historical behavior of fiscal authorities is analyzed from a real-time perspective, it emerges that the intentional stance has been counter-cyclical, especially during expansions, in the main OECD countries throughout the last thirteen years. This is at odds with findings based on revised data, generally pointing to pro-cyclicality (see for example Gavin and Perotti (1997)). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> shown that empirical correlations among revision errors and other second-order moments allow to predict the size and the sign of the bias incurred in estimating the intentional stance of the policy when revised data <b>are</b> (mistakenly) used. <b>It</b> addition, formal tests, based on a refinement of Hansen (1999), do not reject the hypothesis that the intentional reaction of fiscal policy to the cycle is characterized by two regimes: one counter-cyclical, when output is above its potential level, and the other acyclical, in the opposite case. On the contrary, the use of revised data does not allow to identify any threshold effect. The second and third Chapters of this thesis are devoted to the exploration of the impact of fiscal and monetary policies upon the economy. Over the last years, two approaches have been mainly followed by practitioners for the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic policies on the real activity. On the one hand, calibrated and estimated DSGE models allow to trace out the economy’s responses to policy disturbances within an analytical framework derived from solid microeconomic foundations. On the other, vector autoregressive (VAR) models continue to be largely used since they have proved to fit macro data particularly well, albeit they cannot fully serve to inspect structural interrelations among economic variables. Yet, the typical DSGE and VAR models are designed to handle a limited number of variables and are not suitable to address economic questions potentially involving a large amount of information. In a DSGE framework, in fact, identifying aggregate shocks and their propagation mechanism under a plausible set of theoretical restrictions becomes a thorny issue when many variables are considered. As for VARs, estimation problems may arise when models are specified in a large number of indicators (although latest contributions suggest that large-scale Bayesian VARs perform surprisingly well in forecasting. See in particular Banbura, Giannone and Reichlin (2007)). As a consequence, the growing popularity of factor models as effective econometric tools allowing to summarize in a parsimonious and flexible manner large amounts of information may be explained not only by their usefulness in deriving business cycle indicators and forecasting (see for example Reichlin (2002) and D’Agostino and Giannone (2006)), but also, due to recent developments, by their ability in evaluating the response of economic systems to identified structural shocks (see Giannone, Reichlin and Sala (2002) and Forni, Giannone, Lippi and Reichlin (2007)). Parallelly, some attempts have been made to combine the rigor of DSGE models and the tractability of VAR ones, with the advantages of factor analysis (see Boivin and Giannoni (2006) and Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005)). The second Chapter of this thesis, based on a joint work with Agnès Bénassy-Quéré, presents an original study combining factor and VAR analysis in an encompassing framework, to investigate how "unexpected" and "unsystematic" variations in taxes and government spending feed through the economy in the home country and abroad. The domestic impact of fiscal shocks in Germany, the U. K. and the U. S. and cross-border fiscal spillovers from Germany to seven European economies is analyzed. In addition, the time evolution of domestic and cross-border tax and spending multipliers is explored. In fact, the way fiscal policy impacts on domestic and foreign economies depends on several factors, possibly changing over time. In particular, the presence of excess capacity, accommodating monetary policy, distortionary taxation and liquidity constrained consumers, plays a prominent role in affecting how fiscal policies stimulate the economic activity|$|R
