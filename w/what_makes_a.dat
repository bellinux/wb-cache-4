5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> act a pretense one {{for adults and}} preschoolers. Participants watched pretense versus real acts, judged whether each act was pretend or real, and justified their judgment by citing the cues they used. These reported cues are presumed to reflect viewers’ conception of <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>an</b> act a pretense one. The results suggested that like adults, 5 -year-olds represented pretense behavior {{in the form of}} contrasts between pretense and its real counterpart. However, children placed greater weight on deviant content than on behavioral cues, whereas adults used behavioral cues, especially movement, when content information was not available. These results are discussed in terms of how children’s intuitive theories of pretense might differ from those of adults...|$|R

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Although Malaka {{became a}} datuk, {{he left his}} village in October 1913 to study at Rijkskweekschool, a {{government}} teacher education school which was funded by engkus of his village. Arriving at the Netherlands, Malaka initially experienced a culture shock. He also, under-estimating the North European climate, was infected by a pleuritis in early 1914, which did not heal completely until in 1915. During his time in Europe, his knowledge about revolution {{as a mean to}} transformation of society started to increase. The first inspiration source was de Fransche Revolutie, a book by the German historian, author, journalist and social democratic politician Wilhelm Blos 1889, about the French revolution and historical events in France from 1789 until 1804. This book was given to him by Horensma. After the Russian Revolution of October 1917, Malaka increasingly became more and more interested in communism and socialism and communism contra reformist socialism. He was reading the books by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. Friedrich Nietzsche was also one of his early political role models, and may have given him the idea that one man could perform great deeds if he only dared to assume the role of hero. Nietzsche argued that <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> hero (at least in Greek tragedy) is an interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian nature in man – or between the controlled, distanced, structured logical planning (Apollonian) and the wild euphoric, closeness of experience (Dionysian). During this time, around 1917 – 1920 Malaka highly disliked Dutch culture and was impressed by the German and American societies. He then signed up to be a German soldier; however, he was rejected because the German Army did not accept foreigners. There, Malaka met Henk Sneevliet, {{one of the founders of}} Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging (ISDV, forerunner of Partai Komunis Indonesia or PKI). Malaka was also interested in Sociaal-Democratische Onderwijzers Vereeniging (Association of Democrat Social Teachers). In November 1919 Malaka graduated and received his diploma, hulpactie. According to his father, during that time they communicated via mystical means called Tariqa.|$|E

500|$|Koppelman was {{an early}} student of Aesthetic Realism, the {{philosophy}} founded in 1941 by Eli Siegel, {{which is based on}} the principle, [...] "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves". This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> work of art beautiful [...] the oneness of opposites [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E

The majority of the Indian population follow Hinduism (86.2%), with a significant minority identifying as Christians (6.0%) or Muslims (4.1%). Christianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay bumiputera community (46.5%) with an additional 40.4% identifying as Muslims.|$|E
