The international contacts of individual and organized women in both {{the first and the}} second waves of feminist activism are considered. It is necessary to determine the influence, on the one hand, of Turkish women on the international scene of the women s movement and, on the other hand, the influence of the international organizations on Turkish policies vis- -vis women. In this way a little light can be shed on the indirect ways Turkish women, through international networks, were and are able to exert influence on the changing policies of the Turkish government regarding the position of women in their society. ...|$|E

Betty Friedan named the frustration that many career homemakers felt the problem that has no name, and urged them to break away from their domestic confines, go back to school, pursue careers, and revive the vision of female independence that had been alive before World War II. The Feminine Mystique lit a spark for the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation <b>movement</b> in the late 1960 <b>s.</b> The <b>movement</b> included the Old Left women in National Organization of Women (NOW), and the young women who created loosely affiliated small groups collectively known as the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation <b>movement.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> rights entered the political agenda, with giving women the right to abortion in 1973 among the most important victories...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{an investigation}} of an architecture of the Feminine. It {{is not possible to}} give definite examples of the feminine and masculine in architecture. These are abstract concepts and it must be understood that notions of the feminine are highly subjective, influenced by aspects such as culture, gender, background, context and religion. Through an analysis of the theoretical interpretations of the Feminine within architecture, the ways that women occupy and decode space is examined while seeking interpretations that bypass the many literal interpretations that are often associated with the Feminine and architecture. These readings will be used to inform decision making during design. During Apartheid, the <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>Movement</b> had a unified goal of fighting the oppressive powers of the current government. But since the fall of the Apartheid government, this movement has been fractured and {{has not been able to}} mobilise to address needs as a unified group. The proposal intends to foster an atmosphere of dialogue and identity for South African women by creating space that that gives women the possibility to negotiate spatial relationships on their terms. There are a vast number of ways that notions of the feminine can be interpreted with regards to architecture. The design approach thus interprets this information and allows the feminine to be expressed through the creation of space that gives women the possibility of negotiating spatial relationships on their terms, in the in-between or interstitial spaces in the building. Through conceptual investigations, the Void is identified as a space that creates a dimension for rewriting existing structures of social interaction. This inherent characteristic can only be explored if the Void is understood as a space that lacks strict definition in which it creates the dimension of possibility, providing women with the space to define the nature of their spatial relationships on their own terms. To acknowledge the multiplicities that are evident within (social) space is to acknowledge the other that has been ignored. Through occupying the Void that is represented by the site, and by placing focus on the interstitial and in-between spaces in the building, a place is created for negotiation of spaces as well as a place for identity and discussion within the building through the opportunity to rewrite the relationships between occupants.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is {{to explain why the}} United States and Canada, two very similar countries, have taken different approaches to family leave policies. These nations are both established democracies with comparable levels of economic development and federal systems of government. As liberal welfare regimes, they typically look to the market for resource distribution, rather than to the government. However, despite these similarities, the two countries have adopted very different family leave policies. Drawing upon the literature of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements,</b> the study examines the impact that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> had on the family leave policymaking process in the United States and Canada. Because both countries have strong women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements,</b> the research finds that the strength of movements is a necessary but not sufficient explanation for policy divergence. Instead, it is the cohesiveness and issue prioritization of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> within each nation that help determine family leave policies. Using process tracing, the study finds that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> actors {{play a key role in}} the enactment of family leave policies. The data are varied, including interviews with movement leaders, movement literature, archival documents, and secondary literature. The research demonstrates that in situations where women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> are cohesive and prioritize family leave, the legislature is more likely to adopt paid leave policies. Alternatively, paid leave is unlikely to pass when the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> is divided on the issue and does not make it a priority on its agenda. But women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> do not act alone; thus, no one variable can fully explain the policy variation within the United States and Canada. There are a number of other factors that may influence the passage of family leave policies, such as the strength of unions, the presence of critical actors in the legislature, the power of women 2 ̆ 7 s policy agencies, and the ideological orientation of the executive and legislative branches. The study demonstrates that there is an interactive effect between women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> and these other factors...|$|R
40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> {{began in}} 1848 with the Seneca Falls Convention for women 2 ̆ 7 s rights. As {{set forth by}} the {{convention}} 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Declaration of Sentiments, 2 ̆ 2 the movement was concerned with {{a broad array of}} social, religious, cultural and political reforms to bring about gender equality. Following the Civil War, the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> took on the semblance of a single-issue movement, as the effort to achieve woman suffrage consumed feminists 2 ̆ 7 resources and energies. The acquisition of suffrage was intended to be the vehicle for women to gain the spectrum of rights initially defined in 1848. Extravagant predictions about the power of suffrage led many women to view the vote as a panacea for the ills of society and women 2 ̆ 7 s place in society. When the vote failed to bring about major changes in the lives of most women, the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> fragmented and stagnated. The extremely divisive Equal Rights Amendment, introduced in 1922, drove an even deeper wedge among the many branches of American feminism. By 1930, the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> was splintered and disorganized, and would remain so until the 1960 s. But it had also matured and established itself as a permanent feature of the American political and cultural landscape and the desire for gender equality and social justice continued to be the primary force in the lives of American feminists...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the reasons why men join the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> The study combines a literature review of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> with ethnographic empirical research using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. It also draws on participant observation of various men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> events such as men 2 ̆ 7 s groups meetings, weekend gatherings and festivals. Themes and issues explored in the thesis include men 2 ̆ 7 s gender role disorientation, the impact of relationship break-ups, fathering and boys 2 ̆ 7 issues, men 2 ̆ 7 s health, problems with emotional expressiveness and issues of social isolation. Collectively, these and other issues have given rise to the notion of a crisis in masculine identity, or 2 ̆ 7 the masculinity crisis 2 ̆ 7. While there is no consensus about the existence of such a 2 ̆ 7 crisis 2 ̆ 7, men 2 ̆ 7 s endeavours to deal with these issues have lead to the emergence of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> This study identifies four major theoretical positions and men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> groupings to examine men 2 ̆ 7 s issues. They include: the Profeminist strand, Fathers 2 ̆ 7 Rights, the Mythopoetic, and the Inclusives 2 ̆ 7 men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> The review of the literature revealed that the 2 ̆ 7 grassroots 2 ̆ 7 element of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> is an under-researched social terrain. It also highlights existing discrepancy between the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> activities and academic analysis of them. Hence this study is a pioneering work using grounded theory to give representation to the voices {{of the participants in the}} men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> on a range of issues confronting men today. Its scope goes beyond the previously dominant feminist perspective to interrogate the different issues experienced by men from each of the four theoretical men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> perspectives. The findings of the study help to elucidate the nature of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> and its likely trajectory. It traces the evolution of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in Australia and maps the ideological positions of the different men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> strands on a range of social issues affecting men. The study concludes that the main reasons why men join the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> are both ideological and personal. The personal aspect relates to the experience of chronic or acute personal crises and the seeking of support and healing to deal with predicaments. The ideological causes relate to men 2 ̆ 7 s support of the feminist cause or reactions against feminism and the perceived gender inequity in service provision. The empirical findings also illustrated a dialectical interplay of ideological worldviews with regard to gender relationships and personal reasons, including pain associated with the impact of contemporary industrial reforms, gender relationships and masculinity changes which inform their beliefs and understanding, and motivate their continuing involvement. Overwhelmingly, the study found the feminist movement to be the main catalyst for men joining the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> either in support of or as a reaction to its impact on the lives of men. In particular, some men who have joined the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in support of feminism have also discovered that their participation has addressed previously unacknowledged personal issues. Similarly, men who initially participate because of personal crises experience an evolution in their ideological beliefs which motivates their continuing involvement. The findings of the study indicate that men are changing, perhaps not at a rate and intensity women may want, or in a direction that some masculinity observers may wish for, but men are changing. Signs of change include men spending more time with their children, doing more domestic work, engaging in more democratic relationships with women, paying more attention to their physical and emotional health, and developing greater intimacy with other men. The findings of the study emphasise that there is no room for complacency or attributions of blame in the gender relationship discourse. They indicate that there is a need for both women and men to engage in open public gender debate out of which new gender relationship paradigms will emerge...|$|R

These elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges were successfully able to promote a new image of their institutions that argued for their validity, and the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> was an important influence on that process. Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Wellesley decided to remain single-sex colleges for women after the elite men 2 ̆ 7 s colleges moved to coeducation, and I argue {{that they were able to}} do so because student opinion drastically changed in the early 1970 s due to the influence of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> Despite similar goals, the elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges and the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> have not always supported each other.

To date, there has been no systematic attempt at understanding the central processes and dynamics underlying the Irish Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement.</b> This study seeks to address that deficit by illuminating the processes through which the Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement,</b> and, in particular its constituent organisations, came to fruition as agencies of social change. The central argument advanced is that fundamentally the women’s movement in Ireland is characterised by its interconnectedness: the central tensions, themes and organising strategies of the movement interpenetrate not only across different social movement organisations, but across time and space. The movement 2 ̆ 7 s development is conceptualised in terms of four stages: A period of A b eyance which lasted from the Civil War {{until the end of the}} 1960 s; a period of rapid Advancement which occurred during the 1970 s; the Re-appraisal of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> from within, which occurred during the 1980 s; and the New Directions which manifested themselves particularly in the community sector in the late 1980 s and 1990 s. The study demonstrates the continuities which link the movement and its constituent organisations across these four stages of development. A key theme is the continual process of formalisation, which has had the effect of incorporating radical organisations on the margins of the Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement</b> into the mainstream. Parallels can be drawn between the period of advancement in the 1970 s, and the new kinds of consolidation and formalisation occurring in the 1990 s. While the key analytical framework drawn on is resource mobilisation, considerable modifications are made to the model in its application to the Irish Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement.</b> The movement 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory cannot adequately be documented without paying attention to the political opportunity structure, the potential for the development of external alliances, the existence of sympathetic elites and the role of ideology both as a source of conflict and as a valuable resource. The study makes an important contribution to our understanding of Irish social movements. There has been no previous attempt to explain the evolution, form and processes of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> from a sociological perspective. The method of analysis allows for tracing the continuities underlying the movement from the inception of the State to the present day, and challenges the received view that the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> 2 ̆ 7 happened 2 ̆ 7 in Ireland as part of a generalised modernisation trend in the post- 1960 era. This work provides a blueprint for the analysis of other historical and contemporary social movements in an Irish context...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the work of}} local women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> NGOs and <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> in Aceh, a province in Indonesia where Islamic sharia law has been implemented, in particular, {{the work of the}} Women 2 ̆ 7 s Network for Policy or Jaringan Perempuan Untuk Kebijakan (JPUK) as one of the many women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> that have emerged after the granting of special autonomy status to the province in 1999. The work of JPUK in Aceh cannot be separated from the context of the implementation of Islamic law. The article begins by elaborating the implementation of Islamic law, the discriminatory practices and how Acehnese women respond to it. It then discusses how JPUK responds to the situation and works to advance women 2 ̆ 7 s and gender interests in the context of sharia implementation. The article sees that the work of JPUK has been influenced by its network with the national and international women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> or <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s NGOs and argues that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> in Aceh, such as JPUK, have, in many ways, challenged the implementation of Islamic law. This article also discussed the challenges that may hinder the work of women 2 ̆ 7 s organisations in advancing women 2 ̆ 7 s status, justice and equality...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.

Women are classified by marital or social status. During 1720, <b>women</b> <b>s</b> activity constituted 13 per cent of transactions measured by value, 10 per cent of total sales and 8 per cent of total purchases. While individual women lost and made money from their market activity, <b>women</b> <b>s</b> net position over the Bubble was positive. We also provide a case study of Johanna Cock, one of the larger broker jobbers in Bank stock. By September 1720, women made up 20 per cent of Bank shareholders holding 10 per cent of the capital stock. By September 1725, women held nearly 15 per cent of a much larger capital stock. ...|$|R
