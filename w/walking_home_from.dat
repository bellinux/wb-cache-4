5|$|Jeffrey Beaumont {{returns to}} his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina, from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about the ear case and a {{suspicious}} woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may {{be connected to the}} case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E

Mrs Palme was {{slightly}} wounded by a second shot. The couple did not have bodyguards at the time.|$|E
25|$|Political {{violence}} was little-known in Sweden at the time, and Olof Palme often went about without a bodyguard. Close to midnight on 28 February 1986, he was <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a cinema {{with his wife}} Lisbet Palme in the central Stockholm street Sveavägen {{when he was shot}} in the back at close range. A second shot grazed Lisbet's back.|$|E

This made Denyer angry, and she slashed at her head and neck. Russell's death was the most brutal.|$|R

40|$|Older {{adults who}} report {{environmental}} barriers {{in their neighborhood}} have a higher risk for walking difficulty. However, environmental facilitators that protect against walking difficulty are not well known. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the effect of environmental facilitators for outdoor walking on development of walking difficulty in community-dwelling older people. This was a prospective study with a 3. 5 -year follow-up time on 261 community dwelling people aged 75 - 81 years who at baseline were able to walk 0. 5 km without difficulty. Environmental facilitators for outdoor walking were self-reported with standardized questionnaires, including having features in one’s home which make it easy to access the outdoors, having a park or other green area within a <b>walking</b> distance <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> having outdoor recreational facilities within a <b>walking</b> distance <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> having features in the nearby environment which attract for outdoor activities, and perceiving the surrounding environment or facilities nearby as motivating for physical activity. Self-reported difficulty in walking 0. 5 km was assessed every six months. Of the participants, 46 % developed walking difficulty during the follow-up. Having a park or other green area within a <b>walking</b> distance <b>from</b> <b>home</b> was the most frequently reported facilitator. Environmental facilitators decreased the risk for development of walking difficulty, hazard ratio per item 0. 86, (95 % confidence interval 0. 73 - 1. 02). The results indicate that the mobility of older community-dwelling people may be promoted with outdoor recreational facilities that are easy to access and located within a <b>walking</b> distance <b>from</b> <b>home...</b>|$|R
60|$|There was no {{doing it}} on this day. Carey was always {{surrounded}} by children and guests, and in an eager state of activity; but though again they all went home in {{the cool of the}} evening, an attempt to sing in the second-class carriage, which they filled entirely, was quashed immediately-—no one knew how, and nothing worse happened than that a very dusty set, carrying odd botanical, entomological, and artistic wares, trailed through the streets of Kenminster, just as Mrs. Coffinkey, escorted by her maid, was <b>walking</b> primly <b>home</b> <b>from</b> drinking tea at the vicarage.|$|R
25|$|Despite Olof Palme's {{position}} as Prime Minister, {{he sought to}} live as ordinary a life as possible.

His mother found {{the body in the}} morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street. Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out. Later the same night, the men murdered a woman named Valentina Hanzha (no apparent relation to co-defendant Alexander Hanzha), a mother of three with a disabled husband.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{months after}} the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo {{travelled}} by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables.

Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a shopping trip. Once the path both were taking together was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E
500|$|Carla is {{the eldest}} of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is {{somewhat}} seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. [...] "As the therapist in the family Carla likes {{to be the one}} who understands everything" [...] and [...] "has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self-improvement". [...] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother.

[...] In Carla’s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, [...] "Trespass", as she is <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car.
