The stand was designed with possibility to change insert, rotation of engine and abrasive materials. Steel, stainless steel and polyurethane were used for inserts. Sand, glass balls, steel balls and corundum were used as abrasive materials. For the insert the steel balls has the strongest influence, when rotation of engine was 2400 rpm. Stainless steel was the most <b>wearproof</b> material for inserts...|$|E

A multilayer composition "steel - material with shape memory effect (SME) - <b>wearproof</b> layer» (TiNiZr - cBN-Co) was obtained by high-velocityoxy-fuel spraying in a vacuum. The sequence of functional layers’deposition, their composition, thickness, structure-phase state and dispersity were determined by operating conditions and are controlled by the processing modes. To enhance the survivability and longevity,it is recommended to form the SME layer so that its temperature, given the increase in friction, correspondedto the martensitic state and had increased relaxation and damping capacity in order to slow down cracking...|$|E
