5|$|The {{history of}} present day gallantry awards traces {{back to the}} rule of East India Company in India. The first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834, as the Order of Merit, which was later renamed as Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the awards were {{classified}} based on the English traditions for senior officers, junior officers, and enlisted men. Post-independence, the British honours and awards informally came to an end. However, attempts to institute new awards for India to honour the war heroes of 1947–1948 Indo-Pakistani War failed, as India was still a dominion. Eventually, the award was established on 26 January 1950, <b>with</b> <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> from 15 August 1947.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1920s, it was {{accepted}} by the British government that dominions would have full legislative autonomy. This was given legislative effect in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Statute took effect in Australia in 1942 {{with the passing of}} the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, <b>with</b> <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> to 3 September 1939, the start of World War II. The adoption of the Statute repealed the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 in relation to federal legislation. However, the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 continued to have application in individual Australian states until the Australia Act 1986 came into effect in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Therefore {{the draft}} {{warrants}} were never came into effect. On 1 January 1949, as ceasefire was implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, {{and as it}} was becoming too late to honour the war heroes from 1947–1948 Indo-Pak War, Prime Minister Nehru forwarded the draft to Governor General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari to [...] "institute the awards as your own". But Rajagopalachari felt {{that it would be}} inappropriate for him to institute the awards, which did not have the King's approval, and India still being a dominion. Therefore, he suggested Nehru that as Indian was to become republic on 26 January 1950, it would be apt to announce the institution of the wards on that, but <b>with</b> <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> from 15 August 1947.|$|E
5000|$|Not all laws <b>with</b> <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> {{have been}} held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> is the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This law imposes new {{registration}} requirements on convicted sex offenders and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted. [...] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Doe (2003) that forcing sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the science of {{complexity}} is to provide, if not a unified approach, at least useful tools to tackling complex problems in various scientific domains. Generally, complexity is considered a fundamental challenge to the reductionist approach in science {{as a whole and}} to its ideas of certainty and randomness. The overall behaviour of a complex system is different from and {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The behaviour of non-linear complex systems depends on the interaction (often <b>with</b> <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects)</b> among its constituent parts and not so much (or not only) on the characteristics of these parts themselves; the sum of the behaviour of single parts does not necessarily provide us with an explanation of the aggregate behaviour of a system. All this is true for economic systems. These are based on the activities of single economic agents. Each individual can obtain only partial knowledge that is focussed around its "world" (local information) and react to external shocks in different ways (local rationality). The aim of this book is to provide an overview to recent developments in theory and empirical research that view economic systems as complex phenomena whose aggregate dynamics can often not be inferred from its microscopic (microeconomic) building blocks. The collection of papers represented in this volume is dedicated to the memory of Massimo Salzano, who has been a fervent and eloquent advocate of the complexity approach. The contributions have been presented at a conference held to celebrate Massimo’s 60 th birthday (Ecople -Economics: From Tradition of Complexity, Capri, 2 - 4 June, 2006), one year before he unexpectedly passed away in 2007...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe article deals <b>with</b> the dynamic, <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> {{within a}} clause {{derivation}} of various 'downstream' specifications (that is, at subsequent {{levels in the}} derivation) on the semantic structure and aspectual character of the predicator at the 'nuclear', 'core' and 'extended' predication layers within standard Functional Grammar (Dik 1997 a) - specifically, the insertion of given types of argument expressions within the predicate frame and the adjunction of certain semantically marked types of level 1 and level 2 satellites. A third type of <b>retroactive</b> <b>effect</b> is produced via the assignment or otherwise of the pragmatic function Focus to the syntactic exponent of a predicate, which results in the singling out of a given part of the latter's semantic structure {{to act as a}} predicator. All these dynamic, <b>retroactive</b> <b>effects</b> on a predicator and the structures it projects assume a semantically transparent underlying predicate structure on which to operate; yet in the standard FG model, no such structure is available via the predicate frame, which forms the initial structure for the derivation of a clause. The article demonstrates the drawbacks of the strict separation of meaning definitions (lexical semantics) and predicate frames (semantically-based syntax) within FG in terms, precisely, of the perspicuous mapping between syntax and semantics. It proposes a semantically-transparent alternative to the standard predicate frame, based on Pustejovsky's (1995) Generative Lexicon approach to lexico-semantic structure...|$|R
