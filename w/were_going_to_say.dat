2500|$|Back at his hotel, Kennedy complained at 2:55a.m. to {{the hotel}} owner {{that he had been}} awakened by a noisy party. By 7:30a.m., he was talking [...] "casually" [...] to the winner of the {{previous}} day's sailing race and gave no indication that anything was amiss. At 8:00a.m., Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at his hotel where they had a [...] "heated conversation." [...] According to Kennedy's testimony, the two men asked why he had not reported the crash. Kennedy responded by telling them [...] "about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Mary Jo was still alive." [...] The three men subsequently crossed back to Chappaquiddick Island on the ferry, where Kennedy made a series of telephone calls from a pay telephone near the crossing. He made the phone calls to his friends for advice. Again, Kennedy did not report the crash to authorities.|$|E

60|$|Mortimer {{had just}} <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} else, but he checked himself.|$|R
60|$|The prince {{approached}} her deliberately. She {{knew what he}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|WILLIE. Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, {{let us have}} it. The {{more the}} merrier. You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Tony?" [...] says Mr. Guppy, drawing {{nearer to}} the fire and biting his {{unsteady}} thumb-nail. [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> thirdly?" ...|$|E

'My love,' Fanny began, 'our {{characters}} and {{points of view}} are sufficiently different (kiss me again, my darling), {{to make it very}} probable that I shall surprise you by what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> What I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> my dear, <b>is,</b> that notwithstanding our property, we labour, socially speaking, under disadvantages. You don't quite understand what I mean, Amy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] she replied. [...] "Try to {{understand}} what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. If Lord Harry comes to us while Miss Henley is in our house--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed. You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I {{must have}} heard your criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. G. Always in my pocket, you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I {{know you}} are; {{but you are}} always {{thinking}} away from me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, proceed; you've {{interrupted}} yourself {{twice in}} what you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Perhaps it'll come out if you try it a third time." ...|$|E
60|$|She hesitated; {{what she}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> had {{something}} of the anti-climax in it.|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (cynically). Oh, they'll--(He checks what he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{and adds}} lamely)--get along somehow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fie, fie, fie, Master Julian Peveril," [...] {{said the}} governante; [...] "I {{would have you}} to know that I have always so behaved myself, that the best of the land would have thought twice of it, and have very well {{considered}} both what he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and how he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it, before he came out with such proposals to me." ...|$|R
60|$|He held it a moment, {{as if he}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} more. But he {{only looked}} at her; then he took his departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Tipping, scathingly, [...] "and {{you might as}} well talk about that as anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whether he <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "significant" [...] or [...] "insignificant," [...] in Shelton's {{estimate}} he did {{not know}} himself. Fortunately Berryman broke in: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] {{she told}} him, quietly enough and yet very convincingly. [...] "If I {{did not care}} I should not be here. If I did not care, I should not <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the things <b>to</b> you which I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> now. Sit back in your chair, please, hold my hand still, smoke if you will, but listen." ...|$|R
60|$|But I had schooled myself {{beforehand}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it too.|$|R

6000|$|Do not {{interrupt}} me, sweet Miss Smith. I {{feel that}} you are angry.

6000|$|There was a {{trace of}} dryness in Brooke's smile. [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a {{democratic}} one. That, of course, might to some extent explain the anomaly." ...|$|E
