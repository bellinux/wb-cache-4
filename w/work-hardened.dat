The {{method of manufacture}} involved heating the metal in crucibles and casting it into moulds made of stone or clay.

25|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. There is an increase in work-hardening capability with increasing percentage of arsenic, and it can be <b>work-hardened</b> over a wide range of temperatures without fear of embrittlement. Its improved properties over pure copper can be seen with as little as 0.5 to 2wt% As, giving a 10 to 30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|Iron became {{increasingly}} common from the 13th century B.C. Before {{that the use}} of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but <b>work-hardened</b> like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.|$|E
25|$|Whilst arsenic {{was most}} likely {{originally}} mixed with copper {{as a result of}} the ores already containing it, its use probably continued for a number of reasons. Firstly, it acts as a de-oxidiser, reacting with oxygen in the hot metal to form arsenous oxides which vaporise from the liquid metal. If a great deal of oxygen is dissolved in liquid copper, when the metal cools the copper oxide separates out at grain boundaries and greatly reduces the ductility of the resulting object. It can lead to a greater risk of porous castings due to the solution of hydrogen in the molten metal and its subsequent loss as a bubble (but any bubbles could be forge welded and still leave the mass of the metal ready to be <b>work-hardened).</b>|$|E

60|$|Primarily, Kipling {{has stood}} for the doer {{as opposed to}} the dreamer--the doer, who lists not to idle songs of empty days, but who goes forth and does things, with bended back and sweated brow and <b>work-hardened</b> hands. The most {{characteristic}} thing about Kipling is his lover of actuality, his intense practicality, his proper and necessary respect for the hard-headed, hard-fisted fact. And, above all, he has preached the gospel of work, and as potently as Carlyle ever preached. For he has preached it not only to those in the high places, but to the common men, to the great sweating thong of common men who hear and understand yet stand agape at Carlyle's turgid utterance. Do the thing to your hand, and do it with all your might. Never mind what the thing is; so long as it is something. Do it. Do it and remember Tomlinson, sexless and soulless Tomlinson, who was denied at Heaven's gate.|$|E
60|$|The door of {{the house}} is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but she is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been {{watching}} with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last few minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has come late in life. She is an anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman, clean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure linen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is covered with a buff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made of blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the hips, from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey petticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a strong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are somewhat dim now--perhaps from too much crying--but her broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as she stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her <b>work-hardened</b> hands, she has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of water on her head from the spring. There is the same type of frame and the same keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not from her that Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of large-hearted intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Work {{hardening}}, {{also known}} as strain hardening is the strengthening of a metal by plastic deformation. This strengthening occurs because of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of the material. Many non-brittle metals with a reasonably high melting point {{as well as several}} polymers can be strengthened in this fashion. [...] Alloys not amenable to heat treatment, including low-carbon steel, are often <b>work-hardened.</b> Some materials cannot be <b>work-hardened</b> at low temperatures, such as indium, however others can only be strengthened via work hardening, such as pure copper and aluminum.|$|E
50|$|Mangalloy, {{also called}} {{manganese}} steel or Hadfield steel, is a steel alloy containing {{an average of}} around 13% manganese. Mangalloy {{is known for its}} high impact strength and resistance to abrasion once in its <b>work-hardened</b> state.|$|E
50|$|The <b>work-hardened</b> {{steel bar}} {{has a large}} enough number of dislocations that the strain field {{interaction}} prevents all plastic deformation. Subsequent deformation requires a stress that varies linearly with the strain observed, {{the slope of the}} graph of stress vs. strain is the modulus of elasticity, as usual.|$|E
50|$|When {{doing the}} {{hardness}} tests the minimum distance between indentations {{and the distance}} from the indentation {{to the edge of the}} specimen must be taken into account to avoid interaction between the <b>work-hardened</b> regions and effects of the edge. These minimum distances are different for ISO 6507-1 and ASTM E384 standards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>work-hardened</b> {{steel bar}} {{fractures}} when the applied stress exceeds the usual fracture stress and the strain exceeds usual fracture strain. This {{may be considered}} to be the elastic limit and the yield stress is now equal to the fracture toughness, which is of course, much higher than a non-work-hardened steel yield stress.|$|E
50|$|Early Iron Age swords were {{significantly}} different from later steel swords. They were <b>work-hardened,</b> rather than quench-hardened, which made them about the same or only slightly better {{in terms of strength}} and hardness to earlier bronze swords. This meant that they could still be bent out of shape during use. The easier production, however, and the greater availability of the raw material allowed for much larger scale production.|$|E
50|$|Arsenical copper {{contains}} up to 0.5% arsenic which, at elevated temperatures, imparts higher {{tensile strength}} and a reduced tendency to scaling. It is typically specified in boiler work, especially locomotive fireboxes. It also helps prevent embrittlement of oxygen free copper by bismuth, antimony and lead by {{the formation of}} complex oxides. Copper with {{a larger percentage of}} arsenic is called arsenical bronze, which can be <b>work-hardened</b> much harder than copper.|$|E
50|$|The case is {{commonly}} made of brass {{because it is}} resistant to corrosion. A brass case head can be <b>work-hardened</b> to withstand the high pressures of cartridges, and allow for manipulation via extraction and ejection without tearing the metal. The neck and body portion of a brass case is easily annealed {{to make the case}} ductile enough to allow reforming {{so that it can be}} reloaded many times.|$|E
50|$|Silversmiths saw or cut {{specific}} shapes from sterling {{and fine}} silver sheet metal and bar stock, {{and then use}} hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it 'work-hardens'. Annealing is the heat-treatment {{used to make the}} metal soft again. If metal is <b>work-hardened,</b> and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.|$|E

50|$|When {{software}} is new, {{it is very}} malleable; it can be formed to be whatever is wanted by the implementers. But as the software in a given project grows larger and larger, and develops a larger base of users with long experience with the software, it becomes less and less malleable. Like a metal that has been <b>work-hardened,</b> the software becomes a legacy system, brittle and unable to be easily maintained without fracturing the entire system.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping.

50|$|However, {{ductility}} of a <b>work-hardened</b> {{material is}} decreased. Ductility {{is the extent}} to which a material can undergo plastic deformation, that is, it is how far a material can be plastically deformed before fracture. A cold-worked material is, in effect, a normal (brittle) material that has already been extended through part of its allowed plastic deformation. If dislocation motion and plastic deformation have been hindered enough by dislocation accumulation, and stretching of electronic bonds and elastic deformation have reached their limit, a third mode of deformation occurs: fracture.|$|E
50|$|The {{explanation}} {{hinges on}} the crystal's subtle change in dimension. Even a microscopic crystallite is millions of unit cells long. Since all of these units face the same direction, distortions of even {{a fraction of a}} percent become magnified into a major mismatch between neighboring materials. The mismatch is sorted out by the creation of myriad crystal defects, in a process reminiscent of work hardening. As in <b>work-hardened</b> steel, these defects prevent atoms from sliding past one another in an organized fashion, causing the material to become harder.|$|E

As a result of the micro-peening, microscopic cracks and pits are sealed improving corrosion resistance.

50|$|For {{an extreme}} example, in a tensile test {{a bar of}} steel is {{strained}} to just before the distance at which it usually fractures. The load is released smoothly and the material relieves some of its strain by decreasing in length. The decrease in length is called the elastic recovery, and {{the end result is}} a <b>work-hardened</b> steel bar. The fraction of length recovered (length recovered/original length) is equal to the yield-stress divided by the modulus of elasticity. (Here we discuss true stress in order to account for the drastic decrease in diameter in this tensile test.) The length recovered after removing a load from a material just before it breaks is equal to the length recovered after removing a load just before it enters plastic deformation.|$|E

50|$|In some {{pressing}} operations, such as hot {{isostatic pressing}} (HIP) compact formation and sintering occur simultaneously. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques, is used extensively {{in the production of}} high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine blades for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain <b>work-hardened.</b> Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres during forming and cooling stages.|$|E
50|$|A rivet gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive rivets. The rivet gun is used on the manufactured head side of the rivet and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the rivet. The energy from the hammer in the rivet gun drives the work and the rivet against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the rivet is deformed and <b>work-hardened.</b> At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the rivet head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all rivet guns are pneumatically powered. Those rivet guns used to drive rivets in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A rivet gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|E
50|$|In Japan {{the first}} {{documented}} {{introduction of the}} matchlock which {{became known as the}} tanegashima was through the Portuguese in 1543. The tanegashima seems to have been based on snap matchlocks that were produced in the armory of Goa in Portuguese India, which was captured by the Portuguese in 1510. While the Japanese were technically able to produce tempered steel (e.g. sword blades), they preferred to use <b>work-hardened</b> brass springs in their matchlocks. The name tanegashima came from the island where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm. The lord of the Japanese island Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528-1579) purchased two matchlock rifles from the Portuguese and put a sword smith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. Within a few years the use of the tanegashima in battle forever changed the way war was fought in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Mangalloy {{has been}} used in the mining industry, cement mixers, rock crushers, railway {{switches}} and crossings, crawler treads for tractors and other high impact and abrasive environments. It is also used in high impact environments like inside a shot peening machine. These alloys are finding new uses as cryogenic steels, due to their high strength at very low temperatures. Mangalloy is heat treatable, but the manganese lowers the temperature at which austenite transforms into ferrite. Unlike carbon steel, mangalloy softens rather than hardens when rapidly cooled, restoring the ductility from a <b>work-hardened</b> state. Most grades are ready for use after annealing and then quenching from a yellow heat, with no further need of tempering, and usually have a normal Brinell hardness of around 200 HB, (roughly the same as 304 stainless steel), but, due to its unique properties, the indentation hardness has very little effect on determining the scratch hardness (the abrasion and impact resistance of the metal). Another source says that the basic Brinnell hardness of manganese steel according to the original Hadfield specification is 220 but that with impact wear the surface hardness will increase to over 550.|$|E
