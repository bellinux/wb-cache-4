5|$|A {{total of}} 57people were killed across four states and 18counties, with {{hundreds}} of others injured. The outbreak, at the time, was the deadliest {{in the era of}} modern NEXRAD doppler radar, which was fully implemented in 1997. The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> 123, the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, and was at the time the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E
5|$|London {{was plagued}} by disease in the early 17th century, {{culminating}} in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> up to 100,000 people, or {{a fifth of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest {{storm surge}} on record was the 1970 Bhola cyclone, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> up to 500,000 {{people in the}} area of the Bay of Bengal. The low-lying coast of the Bay of Bengal is {{particularly}} vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones. The deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the Cyclone Nargis, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> more than 138,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The next deadliest in this century was caused by the Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> more than 6,000 people in the central Philippines in 2013 and resulted in economic losses estimated at $14 billion (USD).|$|E

5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} inactive basin, extremely high population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie's {{impact was}} minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects {{consisted}} primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> three people and inflicted over $1million (2004USD) in damage.

5|$|Mazdakism {{was viewed}} by the Zoroastrian {{hierarchy}} as a heresy and its followers were persecuted by Zoroastrian Sassanian leaders. The Sassanian ruler Khosrau I launched a campaign against the Mazdakis in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> most of them, including Mazdak himself and restored orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion.|$|E

5000|$|Alternatively, oxidation-fermentation polymyxin-bacitracin-lactose (OFPBL) agar can be used.

[...] It also contains lactose, and organisms such as BCC {{that do not}} ferment lactose turn the pH indicator yellow, which helps to distinguish it from other organisms that may grow on OFPBL agar, such as Candida species, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Stenotrophomonas species.|$|R

5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> eight CIA officers.

5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Although Chan-hom did not {{directly}} affect the Philippines, both Chan-hom and Tropical Storm Linfa enhanced the monsoon for several days, which caused severe flooding throughout the country. Heavy rains impacted portions of Luzon and the Western Visayas, with various events resulting in five deaths. Four people also went missing when their boat sank amid strong winds {{off the coast of}} Pangasinan. A brief tornado caused minor damage in Iba, Zambales. Nearly 34,000people were affected by the monsoon event, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> 16people and caused ₱3.9million (US$86,500) in agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba. The high death toll from Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979, <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> thousands in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic <b>which</b> <b>killed</b> thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
