2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want to make it so that when you hit the left button, you really hit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> arm combo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Pull your right—you, you idiot! back <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left.</b> No, not you—the other one—leave {{the lines}} alone, can’t you—now, both together. NOT that way. Oh, you—!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A light weight, but {{a pretty}} fighter," [...] Mendoza remarked. [...] "Well hit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> Lord Codlingsby; well parried, Lord Codlingsby; claret drawn, by Jupiter!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{psychiatric}} psychoanalyst Theo L. Dorpat compares {{questions and}} interventions {{irrelevant to the}} patient's current thought process during psychotherapy in his book Gaslighting to [...] "the story of the centipede who became disorganized and unable to walk after he was asked, 'What's wrong <b>with</b> <b>your</b> 34th <b>left</b> foot?'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, still alive," [...] I said. [...] "And {{so because}} {{you came to}} the ground <b>with</b> <b>your</b> pain, they <b>left</b> you behind! Well, never mind, Cla-cla, we are two now and must try to be happy together." ...|$|R
50|$|From the one-legged King Pigeon Pose, {{reach back}} <b>with</b> one of <b>your</b> hands and grab <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot or ankle. Then again <b>with</b> <b>your</b> second. Sink into the {{position}} and relax.|$|R
6000|$|... "A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE {{to write}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand. Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW WHO." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up {{with the}} other one," [...] ordered the burglar. [...] "You might be amphibious and shoot <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left.</b> You can count two, can't you? Hurry up, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|While Wade complied, Columbine, shyly {{aware of}} her {{nearness}} to the cowboy, sought to keep up conversation. [...] "Couldn't you help yourself <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand?" [...] she inquired.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, lift Uke up and reap {{his legs}} to <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right leg. Similar to harai goshi gaeshi, {{the counter to}} the {{sweeping}} hip throw.|$|R
5000|$|Step {{back into}} hachiji dachi <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right fist again at <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand side, this time both hands closed. (back of {{right hand to}} the front, back of left hand towards the floor) ...|$|R
5000|$|Purkinje's blue arcs are {{associated}} with the activity of the nerves sending signals from where a spot of light is focussed on the retina near the fovea to the optic disk. Look at the right edge of a small red light in a dark room <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right eye (<b>left</b> eye closed) after dark-accommodating your eye for about 30 seconds and you should see two faint blue arcs starting at the light and heading towards the blind spot. Look at the left edge and you will see a faint blue spike going from the light to the right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you always}} write <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand? And {{if you had}} gone with the first eleven to Geddington, wouldn't that have got {{you out of your}} exam? Try again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I {{have been}} {{exceedingly}} inconvenienced." [...] Here, {{for the first}} time, he looked hard at the assistant. [...] "Good heavens, Mr. Montgomery, {{what have you been}} doing <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> eye?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you're most {{too many}} for me, you know. When {{you get in}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> I hunt grass every time. Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't {{seem to have any}} luck. Lets have a new deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now stand {{straight}} and look happy!" [...] cried Sam as a crowd collected around. [...] "Raise you {{right hand to}} your breast, just as all statesmen do. Up <b>with</b> <b>your</b> chin--don't drop <b>your</b> <b>left</b> eye--close <b>your</b> mouth. Now then, don't budge on your life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Move {{toward the}} left," [...] she whispered. [...] "I know this old pile. When {{you reach the}} table that bears the lamp, {{there will be a}} small doorway {{directly}} behind you. Strike the lamp out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> sword, as you feel my hand in <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> and then I will lead you through that doorway, which you must turn and quickly bolt after us. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We will re-quest you, sir, if you please,' said Buffum, laying {{hands on}} Mr Pogram {{as if he}} were taking his measure for a coat, 'to stand up <b>with</b> <b>your</b> back agin the wall right in the furthest corner, that there may be more room for our fellow citizens. If you could set your back right slap agin that curtain-peg, sir, keeping <b>your</b> <b>left</b> leg everlastingly behind the stove, we should be fixed quite slick.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unhook the tailboard," [...] he said sharply. [...] "Two of {{you pick}} up the shutter. Four more here. Now, arms about his shoulders, hips, and knees. Lift and lower--step off with right foot leading bearer, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> in the rear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's a very steep place," [...] he announced, without, however, looking back. [...] "Randy, {{when you}} reach it, catch hold of the spur of ice <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand and put your foot just beneath it. Tell Earl to do the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't hit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand on top--unless you're left-handed. Don't {{grip the}} end of the bat. There! Hold steady now, step out and into the ball, and swing clean and level. If you're afraid of bein' hit by the ball, get out of here!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> {{foot on the}} line, {{then place}} your right foot on the line ahead of <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> <b>with</b> the heel of your right foot against the toe of <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot.|$|R
50|$|Do {{the same}} thing, except using <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand and wiping <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot.|$|R
50|$|This {{church was}} founded in 1071, and was {{completely}} destroyed by the disastrous Rialto fire in 1514. The church was rebuilt by Antonio Abbondi called Scarpagnino. The painter Antonio Vassilacchi worked here in the 16th century. Nestled into the dense area near the Rialto Market (<b>with</b> <b>your</b> back to the Bridge on the San Polo side, turn left just past the flea market booths; the entrance will be through the frescoed arch behind iron gates on <b>your</b> <b>left).</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Warwick, {{you know}} you ate your supper <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand, and put both behind you when you saw me looking at them. Please let me make them easier; they were burnt for me, and I shall get no sleep till I have had my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The 'ole thing,' {{continued}} the expert, 'is to feint <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and 'it with your right.' This was excellent in theory, no doubt, but Tony felt {{that when he}} came to put it into practice Allen might have other schemes on hand and bring them off first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, little Nod," [...] {{said his}} old dying mother--"never lose, nor give away, nor sport with, nor even lend this Wonderstone; and if in your long journey {{you are in}} danger of the Third Sleep,[4] or lost, or in great fear, spit with your spittle on the stone, and rub softly three times <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> thumb, Samaweeza: Tishnar will hear you; help will come." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Charleston: Swing <b>your</b> <b>left</b> leg to {{the right}} and then back again. Swing your arms in the {{opposite}} direction to <b>your</b> <b>left</b> leg.|$|R
5000|$|Clave {{direction}} is relative while clave alignment is absolute. If you walk from New York to Miami, you're walking south; {{if you walk}} from Miami to New York, you're walking north. But if you put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> shoe on <b>your</b> right foot, (i.e., if your shoes are cruzado), it's {{going to be a}} very awkward walk in either direction. Your shoes remain [...] "aligned" [...] (or misaligned) <b>with</b> <b>your</b> feet regardless of the direction your feet are taking you, and regardless of how poorly they fit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} convex corners is four {{more than the}} number of concave corners. To see why, imagine that you {{traverse}} the boundary of the polygon clockwise (<b>with</b> <b>your</b> right hand inside the polygon and <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand outside). At a convex corner, you turn 90° right; at any concave corner, you turn 90° left. Finally you must make an entire 360° turn and come back to the original point; hence the number of right turns must be 4 more {{than the number of}} left turns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you say, come up stairs?" [...] {{continued}} the voice outside. [...] "All right; I have no objection, if Mrs. Blyth hasn't." [...] Here Zack {{came in with}} his boxing-gloves fitted on. [...] "How are you, Blyth? These are the pills for that sluggish old liver of yours that you're always complaining of. Put 'em on. Stand <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> leg forward--keep your right leg easily bent--and fix your eye on me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All of you {{are doing}} pretty well," [...] remarked Dan Soppinger to the squad of eight under him. [...] "Now then, we'll {{see what you can}} do when it comes to marching. When I give the order 'Forward,' you balance on your right foot, and when the word comes 'March!' you step out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot. And when you step out, do it like this," [...] and he gave an {{illustration}} by marching up and {{down in front of the}} squad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{complimentary}} to me, for I {{was in that}} train. I went--don't {{open your}} eyes--to fetch you this, from the great ingenious town. It is not half so large as your lace-pillow, and lies easily and lightly in its place. These little keys are like the keys of a miniature piano, and you supply the air required <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand. May you pick out delightful music from it, my dear! For the present--you can open your eyes now--good- bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|It is Mrs. Higgins's at-home day. Nobody has yet arrived. Her drawing-room, {{in a flat}} on Chelsea embankment, {{has three}} windows looking on the river; and the ceiling is not so lofty {{as it would be}} in an older house of the same pretension. The windows are open, giving access to a balcony with flowers in pots. If you stand <b>with</b> <b>your</b> face to the windows, you have the {{fireplace}} on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and the door in the right-hand wall close to the corner nearest the windows.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bend <b>your</b> <b>left</b> ear {{down towards}} <b>your</b> <b>left</b> {{shoulder}} {{and then your}} right ear down towards your right shoulder" [...] to test for pain free cervical spine lateral flexion.|$|R
