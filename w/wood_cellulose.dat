5000|$|Recently, at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), wood samples have {{successfully}} been artificially petrified, unlike what is obtained naturally though, by being infiltrated in acidic solutions, diffused internally with titanium and carbon and fired {{in a high}} temperature oven (circa 1400 °C) in an inert atmosphere to yield a manmade ceramic matrix composite of titanium carbide and silicon carbide still showing the initial structure of wood. Future uses would see these artificially petrified wood ceramic materials eventually replace metal-based superalloys (which are coated with ultrahard ceramics) in the tool industry. Other vegetal matter could be treated in a similar process and yield abrasive powders.

Hicks' recipe consists of highly mineralized water and a sodium silicate solution combined with a dilute acid with a pH of 4.0-5.5. Samples of wood are then penetrated with this mineral solution through repeated submersions and applications of the solution. Wood treated in this fashion is according to the claims in the patent incapable of being burned and acquires the features of petrified wood.

Because the carboxymethylation and preparation processes of CMCs from <b>wood</b> <b>cellulose</b> have been established at the industrial level, and because the safety standard issues of CMCs and their production systems have been already satisfied, the conventional industrial-scale carboxymethylation process is applicable to the pretreatment, which is advantageous. However, because carboxymethylation itself is a type of competition reaction between cellulose hydroxyl groups and water molecules always present in the reaction media, the reaction efficiency of introducing carboxymethyl groups only on the crystalline cellulose microfibril surfaces may not be so high. In a contradictory manner, introduction of sufficient amounts of cationic charges to <b>wood</b> <b>cellulose</b> microfibril surfaces originally having anionic charges using cationic polymers via paper chemistry technology has also been exploited as a pretreatment [34]. Partial acetylation of cellulose microfibril surfaces has also been applied to <b>wood</b> <b>cellulose,</b> in which mechanical disintegration of the partially acetylated cellulose fibers was applied to acetone or acrylic resins in the mechanical disintegration stage to reduce energy consumption and achieve homogeneous NFC distribution in the polymer matrix [26, 35].

The normal increased crystallinity was significantly depressed for samples that were oven-dried and then treated in 85 % RH or in water. In the case of boiling-water treatment, a more pronounced increased in crystallinity was initially observed, which then decreased gradually. The crystallinity decreased more than untreated wood for samples that were heat treated for long periods and was slightly higher than the decreased crystallinity {{from the beginning of}} the above two treatments. On the other hand, no significant change in crystallinity was observed for samples of increased crystallinity or decreased crystallinity that were treated under high-moisture conditions, for all three treatments. The results show that the crystalline state of <b>wood</b> <b>cellulose</b> heat treated under oven dry or high-moisture conditions behave differently if treated in water after heat treatment.

Ketene obtained by pyrolysis of acetone over various heated metals which include Zn, Mg, Cu, Fe and ZnS (sphalerite) from a specially modified apparatus used to acetylated wood and industrial cellulose increased surface interaction between the hydrophobic acetylated cellulose with non-polar hydrophobic polyethylene. The results indicated that the acetylation successfully eliminated most accessible hydroxyl groups in the samples as indicated by IR and NMR Spectra data. The blends produced from acetylated cellulose showed improved dimensional stability and reactivity attributed to surface interaction between acetylated cellulose (hydrophobic) and hydrophobic polyethylene. The biodegradation test indicated that the incorporation of acetylated cellulose into polyethylene enhanced their biodegradability implying that acetylated cellulose in poly-products will be a good control measure for pollutants from poly-products. The properties of modified <b>wood</b> <b>cellulose</b> were enhanced, due to lower equilibrium moisture content caused by acetyl groups.
