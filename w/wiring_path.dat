For designing articulated forceps with a shaft diameter of ϕ 7.5  mm, the arc-shaped guide radius r 1 should be 1.75  mm, including the wire diameter, and the rotation radius of the wire tip around the pitch axis r 2 should be 9.7  mm.

The arc-shaped guide provides sufficient bending radius of the wire and minimizes the change in the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires arising from pitch axis motion. Compared with the case of using pulleys, there is concern about friction between the wire and circular arc-shaped surface, but the bending radius of the wire can be greatly increased and the number of parts can be greatly reduced.|$|R

50|$|SINR is {{commonly}} used in wireless communication {{as a way to}} measure the quality of wireless connections. Typically, the energy of a signal fades with distance, which is referred to as a path loss in wireless networks. Conversely, in wired networks the existence of a <b>wired</b> <b>path</b> between the sender or transmitter and the receiver determines the correct reception of data. In a wireless network ones has to take other factors into account (e.g. the background noise, interfering strength of other simultaneous transmission). The concept of SINR attempts to create a representation of this aspect.|$|R
30|$|In this scenario, {{we assume}} that the <b>wired</b> <b>path</b> is {{congested}} with congestion packet loss rate of 1.5 % due to the forward cross traffic. The proposed schemes improve the throughput by about 44 % compared with DCR over cellular network before handover. However, after handover to WLAN, both of proposed schemes I and II improve the throughput by 480 % and 457 % compared with DCR and DCR-FRTO, respectively. The reason for this great difference is that unlike proposed schemes, the throughputs of previous schemes are suppressed by congestion after handover from a slow link to a fast link.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} between proposed schemes I and II is negligible in noncongestion scenario (Figures 11 and 12). The large difference in WLAN throughput in Figures 13 and 14 {{can be explained}} as follows. In our simulation, the forward cross traffic is added on the <b>wired</b> <b>path</b> which has much shorter latency than the wireless paths (3 G and WLAN). The added traffic dominates the TCP traffic on WLAN or 3 G since it flows only over <b>wired</b> <b>path</b> of high bandwidth (20 [*]Mbps) and very short delay (1 millisecond). Still, the throughput of TCP traffic over WLAN is {{much larger than the}} throughput of TCP traffic over the 3 G path since the WLAN has much larger bandwidth (10 [*]Mbps) and much shorter delay (20 milliseconds) than 3 G path of 1 [*]Mbps bandwidth and 200 milliseconds delay. Thus, before the handover, the suppressed TCP throughput over 3 G is much smaller than that over WLAN. Immediately after the handover to WLAN, the TCP throughput is slow to recover in previous schemes (Sack, DCR, DCR-FRTO) and is faster to recover in proposed schemes, but all still remain small due to the limited TCP throughput over 3 G before handover as shown in Figure 13. However, the situation is different when handover is performed from WLAN to 3 G as shown in Figure 14. The TCP throughput over WLAN before handover is large compared with that over 3 G before handover. Thus the TCP throughput over 3 G after handover is large whether the schemes are slow to recover (in previous schemes) or fast (proposed schemes). Thus, the big difference in WLAN throughput {{can be explained by the}} difference in TCP throughputs over 3 G and WLAN under congested condition.|$|R
30|$|Laparoscopic surgery, {{which is}} also called {{minimally}} invasive surgery, is a surgical technique {{that is associated with}} accelerated post-operative recovery. However, it can only be performed by surgeons possessing advanced surgical skills. One of the main challenges in laparoscopic surgery is the restriction of the free motion of forceps because of the limited degrees of freedom imposed by the trocar. Recently, to overcome this problem, many master–slave manipulators with articulated forceps have been used in laparoscopic surgery. The wrist mechanism of the articulated forceps affects the controllability and range of motion of the slave manipulator in the abdominal cavity of a patient. Therefore, improvement of the wrist mechanism of the articulated forceps is important for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. This study proposes a new wrist mechanism for using articulated forceps in laparoscopic surgery. The degrees of freedom of the proposed design are provided by motor-driven or manually driven axes employing various wires and pulleys (pitch, yaw, and gripper axes). The kinematic model of this mechanism is decoupled between the pitch axis and yaw axis by a very simple mechanism using arc-shaped guides and wire guide holes. The arc-shaped guides minimize the <b>wire</b> <b>path</b> length error of the yaw and gripper axis wire resulting from the motion of the pitch axis. The optimized position of the arc-shaped guides is decided by the minimal root-mean-square value of the <b>wire</b> <b>path</b> length error. The proposed wrist mechanism has only half the number of parts as compared to the previously developed robotic forceps for clinical use. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was demonstrated on a prototype model with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5  mm. Conversely, the disadvantages of the proposed mechanism lie in the transmission mechanism efficiency and no-load input torque.|$|R
