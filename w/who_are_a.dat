5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E

He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to read everything about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> little weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E

25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} {{tend to view}} deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, {{in the sense of}} a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore some <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E
25|$|By {{identifying}} {{risk factors}} present {{within a community}} and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury, trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall health of a population. Injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> high risk population. Injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific risk factors and developing strategies to avoid or reduce injuries. Legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts, child car-seats, helmets, alcohol control, and increased enforcement of the legislation. Other controllable factors, {{such as the use}} of drugs including alcohol or cocaine, increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, violence, and abuse occurring. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly people.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{brief period}} of reunion and revival under George V the Brilliant (1299–1302, 1314–1346). With the support of Chupan, ulus-beg of the Ilkhanate, George {{eliminated}} his domestic opponents who remained independent of the Georgian crown. George V conquered Imereti uniting all of Georgian Kingdom before the death of the last effective Ilkhan Abu Sai'd. In 1319 George and the Mongols suppressed the rebellion of the Ilkhanid governor of Georgia, Qurumshi. Presumably due to the internal strife between the Mongol khanates and ilkhanid generals, almost all Mongol troops in Georgia withdrew in 1320s. The Ilkhan Abu Sai'd (d.1335) exempted Ani and the neighbouring districts of Georgi from any kind of taxes. In a 1321 letter of Avignon mentions schismatic people (Georgians) <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of Tatar Empire (Ilkhanate).|$|E

25|$|The {{facility}} {{is best known}} for housing inmates who have been deemed too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. These include the leaders of violent gangs who had continued to issue orders to their members from lower-security facilities: Larry Hoover of the Gangster Disciples, and Barry Mills and Tyler Bingham of the Aryan Brotherhood. ADX also houses foreign terrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in civilian court of the September 11 attacks; Faisal Shahzad, the perpetrator of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt; and Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; as well as domestic terrorists, such as Ted Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph. Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, was housed at ADX before he was sentenced to death in 1997 and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, which houses most federal death row inmates and is where Federal death sentences are carried out. McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, is serving 161 life sentences at ADX. Robert Hanssen, the former FBI agent who betrayed several spies to the Soviet Union and Russia, is serving 15 life sentences at ADX for his crimes. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombings, was transferred here from another prison in the Florence complex on July 17, 2015. The prison also houses inmates <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> high escape risk, including Richard McNair, who escaped from a county jail and two other prisons before being sent to ADX.|$|E

500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though {{they knew what they}} were doing was wrong in terms of the actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
