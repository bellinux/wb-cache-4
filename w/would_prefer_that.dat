25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
25|$|Relational ties principle: The fusion {{approach}} {{assumes that}} strongly fused persons care {{not only about}} their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (real or imagined) {{with other members of}} the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom they may have had little or no contact. Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).|$|E

They <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{crowd of}} 3,000 {{people went to}} the Senate to demand a {{declaration}} of majority. The [...] "supporters of an immediate majority gathered at the Senate and passed a motion, signed by 17 senators (out of 49) and by 40 deputies (out of 101), calling on the emperor to take full powers." [...] A delegation of eight, led by Antônio Carlos de Andrada carrying this declaration, proceeded to the Imperial Palace of São Cristóvão to ask if Pedro II would accept or reject the early declaration of his majority. Pedro II asked for the opinion of Itanhaém, Friar Pedro Mariana and Araújo Viana (pawns of the [...] "Courtier Faction"), who convinced him to accept and thus prevent new disorders in the country. The emperor would say years later that the Liberals had taken advantage of his immaturity and inexperience. He shyly answered [...] "Yes" [...] {{when asked if he}} desired the age of majority to be lowered, and [...] "Now" [...] when asked if he <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> it come into effect at that moment or if he would wait until his birthday in December.|$|E
2500|$|Like the Prisoner's Dilemma, {{this game}} {{presents}} {{a conflict between}} self-interest and mutual benefit. [...] If it could be enforced, both players <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> they both cooperate throughout the entire game. [...] However, a player's self-interest or players' distrust can interfere and create a situation where both do worse than if they had blindly cooperated. [...] Although the Prisoner's Dilemma has received substantial attention for this fact, the Centipede Game has received relatively less.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{areas that}} are popular for climbing, for example in the United States and Australia, are also sacred places for {{indigenous}} peoples. [...] Many such indigenous people <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> climbers not climb these sacred places and have made this information well known to climbers. [...] A well-known example is the rock formation that Americans have named Devils Tower National Monument. Native American cultural concerns also led to complete climbing closures at Cave Rock at Lake Tahoe, Monument Valley, Shiprock and Canyon de Chelly.|$|E
2500|$|Prisoner {{in his own}} Kingdom, {{the young}} monarch took very badly the {{separation}} from his family. He regularly wrote letters to his parents, [...] but they were intercepted {{by the government and}} his family didn't receive them. Under these conditions, the only comfort of Alexander was Aspasia and he decided to marry her despite the recommendations of his father and the opposition of the Prime Minister. Indeed, Eleftherios Venizelos, despite being previously a friend of Petros Manos (Aspasia's father), feared that she used her family connections to mediate between Alexander I and his parents. Above all, the Prime Minister <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> the monarch could marry with Princess Mary of the United Kingdom to strengthen the ties between Greece and the Triple Entente.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2005, Michigan's Republican-dominated {{legislature}} {{refused to}} vote on Granholm's proposed state budget, citing concerns over cuts to state funding for higher education. In the previous years of Granholm's term, many cuts to higher education had been demanded and voted in the legislature in order to balance the state budget. The year before, Republican leaders had called Granholm a [...] "do‑nothing governor", claiming that she failed to lead, while Democrats accused legislative Republicans of being obstructionist. In January 2005, Granholm presented an early budget proposal, demanded immediate response from the Legislature, and {{held a press conference}} outlining the highlights of the proposed budget. After refusing to consider, debate, or vote on the proposed budget, Republicans stated they <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> the legislature have more involvement {{in the formation of the}} state budget.|$|E

Macron also expressed reservations about the proposed third debate, stating that he wanted only one debate with all 11 candidates before the first round, and preferably not just {{three days before the}} first round of voting. On 29 March, the CSA indicated that it was [...] "concerned" [...] that the date of the debate was too close to the first round, and recommended that candidates and broadcasters work to find an agreement as quickly as possible. France Télévisions decided to maintain the date of 20 April {{due to the lack of}} a consensus on an alternative the following day, but abandoned plans for a third debate on 5 April, instead proposing that individual candidates be interviewed by Léa Salamé and David Pujadas during that timeslot. The plan was finally confirmed on 18 April, with France 2 offering successive 15-minute interviews to the 11 candidates with the two hosts.|$|E
2500|$|Leo Steinberg in his 1988 text [...] "The Philosophical Brothel" [...] {{quotes from}} an uncited source which may provide insight {{regarding}} Picasso's intent {{in the creation}} and context of Les Demoiselles D’Avignon. Quoting from an anonymous but well-informed New Yorker, Steinberg suggests that [...] "in 1907 Picasso had contracted VD, and painted the Demoiselles to vent his rage against women". This assumption may be reinforced in the artist's referral to the work as [...] "My first exorcism-painting". In 1965 the British critic John Berger suggested that Picasso, during his first years in Paris, [...] "probably was suffering from venereal disease and was obsessed by it". Then, in her Picasso: Art as Autobiography, Mary Gedo substantiated Berger's suspicion (having had it confirmed by Françoise Gilot). Accordingly, she interpreted much of the evolution and final character of the Demoiselles {{in the light of}} the artist's medical history and consequent ambivalence toward women. While critics such as Alfred H. Barr Jr. <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> the work be discussed in purely formalistic qualities, Edwin Mullins states that the effect of STIs cannot be so easily be disregarded and that though these are [...] "not today’s experiences of art, they are among the experiences out which, and for which, art has been made - and without which a great deal of art would not have been made at all". Carol Duncan in her 1973 article [...] "Virility and Domination in Early Twentieth—Century Vanguard Painting" [...] states that: ...|$|E
2500|$|DMCA {{claims have}} also been {{threatened}} or used to remove Let's Plays of games owned by a company who {{do not agree with}} ideals or morales of the person creating the video. In September 2017, Kjellberg accidentally blurted out a racist insult while live-streaming a game to viewers, later apologizing for this; this followed previous incidents of where Kjellberg's on-screen behavior had been criticized. Campo Santo's founder Sean Vanaman was dismayed by this, and issued a DMCA notice to takedown Kjellberg's Let's Play of their game Firewatch, stating that having their game shown on his YouTube channel was the equivalent of endorsing his ideologies; YouTube complied with this request a few days later. Vanaman later clarified that his goal was not to censor Kjellberg, but that there is a [...] "bad fit" [...] between Kjellberg's views and Campo Santo's views and <b>would</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>that</b> Kjellberg not cover his games. Lawyers and legal experts speaking to both Kotaku, The Verge and PC Gamer believed that content owners like Campo Santo have full control to issue DMCA takedowns under the law, but whether these takedowns are valid under fair use defense within copyright law is unclear, since to this point there has been no case law to challenge the legality of Let's Plays and other video game video walkthroughs or challenges to DMCA takedowns for this type of content. Kjellberg did not plan to counter the DMCA claim but pointed out that the use of DMCA to take down videos due to issues other than related to copyright has a potential for abuse by game developers and publishers and affect the current balance of the value of Let's Plays in game promotion and marketing.|$|E
