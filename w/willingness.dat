5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's <b>willingness</b> to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his <b>willingness</b> to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E

5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker than others in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators.

5|$|Given the <b>willingness</b> of {{the players}} to cross the picket lines and {{networks}} to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands.

The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E
5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's <b>willingness</b> to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E

5|$|He {{was known}} for his <b>willingness</b> to apply an equal degree of {{scrutiny}} to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws.

5|$|I {{will not}} be {{attending}} this year's convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States — a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a <b>willingness</b> to address the trust deficit, which {{is every bit as}} corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.|$|E
5|$|Ike {{began to}} fear that word of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M.

5|$|In 2006, the {{government}} of India nominated Tharoor for the post of UN Secretary-General.

5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's <b>willingness</b> {{to follow}} God's command to {{sacrifice}} Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigure of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.|$|E
5|$|Many school traditions {{revolve around}} {{sporting}} events, especially football. Before games, university yell leaders host yell practice, {{similar to other}} schools' pep rallies. Instead of cheers, students learn yells. Since 1922, students, known as the 12th Man, stand throughout football games, symbolizing their <b>willingness</b> {{to step in and}} assist the team. The official mascot, a dog named Reveille, is present at most official university activities, including sporting events.|$|E
5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing <b>willingness</b> to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.|$|E
5|$|No {{matter which}} side of the debate the experts are on, they all agree on one thing: All forms of custody work best with good {{communication}} and a <b>willingness</b> for the parents to work and to shield children from being involved in their parents' disputes.|$|E
5|$|Okinawa was {{declared}} secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945, after an intense and costly battle. Japan surrendered in August 1945, after being bombed twice with atomic weapons.

5|$|On the {{certificate}} of division, in United States v.

5|$|One {{reason for}} the mission's success was that it worked by example. Also {{important}} was Gregory's flexibility and <b>willingness</b> to allow the missionaries to adjust their liturgies and behaviour. Another reason was the <b>willingness</b> of Æthelberht to be baptised by a non-Frank. The king would have been wary of allowing the Frankish bishop Liudhard to convert him, as that might open Kent up to Frankish claims of overlordship. But being converted by {{an agent of the}} distant Roman pontiff was not only safer, it allowed the added prestige of accepting baptism from the central source of the Latin Church. As the Roman Church was considered part of the Roman Empire in Constantinople, this also would gain Æthelberht acknowledgement from the emperor. Other historians have attributed the success of the mission to the substantial resources Gregory invested in its success; he sent over forty missionaries in the first group, with more joining them later, a quite significant number.|$|E
5|$|Other chains {{were created}} to serve the {{increasingly}} mobile patron. Carl Karcher opened his first Carl's Jr. in 1956, and rapidly expanded, locating his restaurants near California's new freeway off-ramps.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his <b>willingness</b> to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E
5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and <b>willingness</b> of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.|$|E
5|$|Several hours later, Martha is {{frustrated}} {{to see her}} husband negotiating with terrorist Vladimir Bierko and his <b>willingness</b> to compromise Yuri Suvarov and his wife's safety. Aaron Pierce eventually saves her from the ambush on the Suvarovs' motorcade. Martha continues to question Logan's motives as her husband attempts to prevent her from finding out {{about his role in}} Palmer's death.|$|E
5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264 BC when {{settlements}} on Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay– Rome and Carthage– in order to solve internal conflicts. The <b>willingness</b> of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a <b>willingness</b> to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a <b>willingness</b> to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E
