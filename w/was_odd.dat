5|$|An armed {{reconnaissance}} by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December resulted in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E

Each facial {{expression}} {{is made of}} rubber and pasted on the actors {{to cut down on}} the time and cost for shoot. The effect was achieved by a variety of methods including choosing the right material for the body suits to ensure that there were no wrinkles when the characters moved, shooting the footage at lower framerates and keeping backgrounds simple in terms of details and the use of a neutral tone of grey. The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting <b>was</b> <b>odd.</b>|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, stricter {{emergency}} pollution {{controls were}} introduced, including suspending production at more factories and coal-fired power plants, lowering {{the number of}} {{cars on the road}} and expanding driving restrictions to nearby Tianjin. In early July, Beijing ordered 40 factories in Tianjin and 300 factories in Tangshan to begin suspending operations in an effort to reduce air pollution. On 20 July, a major temporary air pollution control plan began: additional factories were shut down; there were license plate restrictions which allowed Beijing motorists to drive on alternate days only, depending on whether the last number on their license plate <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> or even, to reduce daily traffic by two million vehicles. Despite the program, by 28 July the China Daily reported that Beijing's skies remained alarmingly polluted and that authorities were considering emergency measures during the Games.|$|E

[...] In 2006, the band signed a two-album deal with label Brutal Bands, and proceeded to re-record and re-release Butcher the Weak. The new release's cover was yellow, while the self-released version sported a green cover, though they bore the same design.|$|E
500|$|Repeated {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} delay at zero for subjects {{with a variety of}} ages and national and linguistic backgrounds, confronted with number names in numeral form, spelled out, and spelled in a mirror image. Dehaene's group did find one differentiating factor: mathematical expertise. In one of their experiments, students in the École Normale Supérieure were divided into two groups: those in literary studies and those studying mathematics, physics, or biology.

500|$|During its operation, the gaol was {{the setting}} for 133 hangings. [...] The most infamous was that of bushranger Ned Kelly {{at the age of}} 25, on 11 November 1880. After a two-day trial, Kelly was convicted of killing a police officer. As stated by law at the time, {{executed}} prisoners were buried in unmarked graves in the gaol burial yard. [...] Before burial, a death mask was produced from the executed prisoners head as part of the phrenological study of hanged felons.

500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, The Bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, [...] "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs.|$|E

500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it <b>was</b> <b>odd,</b> but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|MercyMe began {{recording}} the album over Christmas 2004, {{and put the}} [...] "finishing touches" [...] on it over the following summer. The band brought in rock producer Brown Bannister, who had previously recorded albums for artists like Amy Grant and Steven Curtis Chapman, to produce both The Christmas Sessions and their next studio album, which would also utilize a rock sound. In selecting songs for The Christmas Sessions the band wanted to cover Christmas songs they had grown up with, but they did write and record one original song, [...] "Joseph's Lullaby". Millard had initially written it as [...] "Mary's Lullaby" [...] but changed the lyrics and key upon suggestion from Bannister's wife, who noted that, being male, it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> {{for him to be}} singing from the perspective of Mary as opposed to Joseph.|$|E
500|$|In interviews, Frobisher {{elicited}} the students' reasoning. One fifth-year {{decided that}} 0 was even {{because it was}} found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned [...] "1 is odd and if I go down it's even." [...] The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses. A second-year was [...] "quite convinced" [...] that zero <b>was</b> <b>odd,</b> on the basis that [...] "it is the first number you count". A fourth-year referred to 0 as [...] "none" [...] and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since [...] "it's not a number". In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends {{wrote that}} the {{collection}} [...] "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available", and that for fans of the series, [...] "this collection is not for you" [...] as all games (with the exception of God of War III) are available for download, and it will [...] "likely be redundant." [...] However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> that the PSP games were included as downloads, {{and would like to}} have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a 4 out of 5 and called it [...] "an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood-drenched action–especially newcomers who get five titles for the price of one", but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection.|$|E
500|$|Solipskier was {{designed}} for the Adobe Flash platform. Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend had worked on Flash games earlier as Intuition Games. The idea for the game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed, and eventually Boxleiter [...] "blurted out with wide-eyes" [...] that the player could [...] "paint the terrain to determine {{the speed of the}} character". They chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night. Boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games (heightmaps from Dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from EON) to make a mockup within hours: a red ball that moved along with a slope (made with the mouse) and floated down slowly when suspended in air. He added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed, which was not apparent otherwise. Boxleiter then set up indicators to show the incoming gates, though he thought it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> to have the indicators move to the right as the gate moved to towards the player (to the left). There was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase.|$|E

Well, maybe not... but you could forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting just thinking about it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E

Most other reviewers also noted how good their voices sounded together, including Chaney, {{who gave the}} song a [...] "B−", and Bell, who called their harmonies [...] "out-of-this-world amazing". Lynch and Slezak each praised the tenderness in Riley's vocals; Lynch gave the song an [...] "A", and Slezak an [...] "A−". [...] "Ben", however, received far more mixed commentary, and several reviewers felt it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> to, as Chaney put it, sing a song about a rat [...] "to a guy who isn't named Ben and was wearing an eye patch", which Futterman called [...] "a little creepy" [...] and VanDerWerff, more bluntly, [...] "fucking weird". Despite this, Chaney gave the song a [...] "B", one of her highest grades of the night, {{in part because it}} gave Colfer [...] "an excuse to hit those 'You’ve got a friend in me' high notes", while Futterman noted that he [...] "does well in the high range", and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn. Bell, however, called the song [...] "a snooze-fest", and Slezak was very unhappy with the [...] "interminable rendition" [...] which he graded a [...] "D". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|Leading pro-establishment figures {{cast doubt}} on the mainland's {{supposed}} role in the disappearances: Ip Kwok-him said {{that it was possible to}} use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the phone call from a Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, Yiu Si-wing disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; Michael Tien said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; Wong Kwok-kin said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports. Regina Ip said it <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong. Ng Leung-sing, during a Legislative Council discussion, claimed to have received a tip from [...] "an old friend" [...] that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island (...) , an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes. The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as character assassination, were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item. Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name. Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.|$|E
500|$|... 30 years-old at {{the time}} of her audition, O'Hara {{consequently}} imbued Belle's voice with a mature, [...] "womanly quality" [...] despite the character's young age. Woolverton appreciated the fact that O'Hara sounded more mature than traditional Disney heroines. Additionally, O'Hara identified with her character because they were both ostracized by their peers throughout their childhood because of their unconventional interests, explaining, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>odd</b> growing up myself. I mean, I was into musical theater and Gershwin and Rodgers and Hammerstein while people were going to Led Zeppelin concerts. So I understood that ... I wasn't the norm either. I was very focused on my career, on my performing all through my childhood and my teens ... I had a one-track mind, and I think that Belle was like that a lot." [...] O'Hara also shares Belle's interest in reading. Wise was pleased with the quality of O'Hara's voice, which reminded him of Garland. O'Hara initially found it challenging to control her speaking volume due to having been trained to project as a stage actress. O'Hara told The Guardian that to solve this she [...] "softened and used the microphone." [...] As per the filmmakers' encouragement, the actress would occasionally ad-lib her own dialogue, none was included in the final film because it sounded [...] "too modern". The animators would videotape O'Hara daily while she recorded to incorporate her [...] "quirky" [...] mannerisms, expressions and gestures into the character, among them her hair constantly falling into her eyes. O'Hara and American actor Robby Benson, who provides the voice of the Beast, asked Disney to allow the co-stars to record together as opposed to the traditional method of being isolated in a recording booth, to which the studio agreed despite its costliness. O'Hara credited the filmmaker's decision with developing both the film and Belle and the Beast's relationship. O'Hara and Benson became the first Disney voice actors to record together. In total, the recording process took over two years to complete. O'Hara had already been friends with co-star Richard White, who voices Gaston, for 15 years. Despite her successful stage career, O'Hara was virtually unknown to Hollywood audiences when she was cast in Beauty and the Beast; she was one of the last obscure actresses to be cast in a feature-length Disney animated film before the studio began casting better known talent in subsequent animated projects.|$|E
