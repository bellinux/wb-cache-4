25|$|This first {{structured}} sanctioning {{body would}} eventually grow to seven tracks in California. This is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{different from other}} track operators at the time: he did not just start one track but several others under a single jurisdiction of rules and regulations, all the requirements of a sanctioning body.|$|E
25|$|This {{resulted}} in being turned back again, {{putting him in}} the class of 1851. The year 1850 brought Smith close to failing again, just short of being deficient in Chemistry and accumulating 177 demerits; but in the end he managed to pass the year and became a Firstie, or first class cadet. In his last year he accumulated the allowed 200 demerits, <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the second worst cadet currently at the academy, and once again short of failing. But he didn't; his grades were all {{in the last quarter of}} his class, except engineering, and he graduated as 36th out of 42 graduates on July 1, 1851.|$|E

500|$|After Olivier's death, Gielgud reflected, [...] "He {{followed}} in the theatrical tradition of Kean and Irving. He respected tradition in the theatre, but he also took great delight in breaking tradition, which is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> so unique. He was gifted, brilliant, {{and one of the}} great controversial figures of our time in theatre, which is a virtue and not a vice at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{a talented}} politician, speaker, and organizer. <b>What</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{remarkable}} was the stubbornness {{with which he}} clung to his principles... {{became one of the}} best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the adamantine insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain must stand for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and unilateral disarmament, policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse.|$|E
500|$|Former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden {{described}} of Orr: [...] "When {{he began}} to move... the sensation was unique: All the Canadiens began backpedalling in a small panic, like beachgoers sighting a coming monster wave. He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> so different: It felt like a five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace. He pushed his teammates, [...] you're playing with {{the best player in}} the league and he's giving you the puck and you just can't mess it up. You had to be better than you'd ever been." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Kunis {{participated in}} a video for the website Funny or Die {{appearing}} alongside James Franco. The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4 million views {{over the next ten}} years. Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video. In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's [...] "Shine Your Own Star" [...] Christmas campaign.|$|E
500|$|Steve Young, {{a writer}} for the Late Show with David Letterman, was brought in as a {{freelance}} writer to write the episode. The writers wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> act the way he does. The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, {{a writer for}} Saturday Night Live, who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do a bad job and provoke an outburst.|$|E
500|$|Clark had {{converted}} to Catholicism, his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., {{for the first}} time while at the Valley Forge Hospital. Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, 194th Armored Brigade, a company composed of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> decide to continue his military career past the five-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was {{to the office of the}} Army Chief of Staff in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the [...] "Modern Volunteer Army" [...] program from May to July 1971. He then served as an instructor in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.|$|E
50|$|But <b>what</b> really <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{remarkable}} was {{his work}} as a writer and his influence upon Portuguese society socialist realism. In 1939, at only 20 years of age, he started publishing his first texts in the weekly newspaper 'O Diabo'.|$|R
5000|$|He was <b>what</b> God <b>made</b> <b>him,</b> a great pleader. He had a sixth sense: {{he could}} see around corners. That is where his talents lay ... {{he was a very}} clear thinker ...

500|$|He {{was voted}} the National Football League Players Association NFC Offensive Lineman {{of the year}} four times—1983, 1986, 1987, and 1989 and was the Athletes in Action/Bart Starr Award winner after the 1995 season. Slater played in 259 games from 1976 to 1995, a then-record for {{offensive}} lineman (broken by Bruce Matthews in the 1999 season). He was {{the first player to}} play 20 seasons for one team, later matched by Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson and third all-time. He played for 24 quarterbacks and 37 running backs in his lengthy career, during which seven running backs reached for over 1,000 yards in a season and played in seven Pro Bowls. Former teammate Jim Everett stated [...] "Jackie Slater is proof they were playing football in the prehistoric days". [...] He was Dickerson's Hall of Fame presenter in 1999. In 2001, Slater was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Upon hearing his induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, fellow inductee and teammate Jack Youngblood said [...] "Jackie Slater didn't want to just beat you, he wanted to dominate you. That's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the player that he was." [...] On being honored, Slater stated [...] "As you walk around and shake hands with some of the greatest players in history, it finally hits you, that you belong. You're a part of the greatest roster ever assembled." ...|$|E

60|$|It was curiously childish, he thought, and {{he smiled}} to himself. He opened the book. <b>What</b> he saw <b>made</b> <b>him</b> wince {{as though he had}} been struck.|$|R
60|$|He chuckled {{silently as}} he thought of Steve. Of all the mad things to do! <b>What</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> think of it? How had such a wild scheme ever entered his head? This, he supposed, was what Steve called {{punching}} instead of sparring. But he had never given him credit for the imagination that could conceive a punch of this magnitude.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Clapper {{was ranked}} number 41 on The Hockey News {{list of the}} 100 Greatest Hockey Players of all time. [...] "Clapper had a simple creed," [...] wrote The Hockey News. [...] "He fought his heart out, bounced players around and took {{the same kind of}} {{punishment}} he dished out. That's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> so popular with other players and fans throughout the NHL." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steve Oram {{appears as}} Daniel, Sara's assistant. When asked <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{want to get}} {{involved}} in the project, Oram revealed that he had loved the script from the moment he read it and really liked his character. Oram called Daniel [...] "slightly misguided and psychopathic", but he has a good heart. Sara's other friends, Jamie and Justine, are portrayed by Dominic Coleman and Nicola Walker. Coleman auditioned for the role of Jamie, but was unsure if he would get the part as he did not have much in common with the character.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Debruge of Variety {{gave the}} film a mixed review: [...] "Any movie {{in which the}} {{longtime}} FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> tick, or suffer from the reality that the Bureau's exploits were far {{more interesting than the}} bureaucrat who ran it – a dilemma J. Edgar never rises above." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine reacted negatively to the film and said: [...] "It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings." [...] He praised DiCaprio's performance: [...] "There’s something appealingly straightforward about the way he physicalizes Hoover's inner struggle, the body always slightly out of sync with the mind that vigilantly monitors every move." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{found my}} mind turning to {{another aspect of}} this rummy affair. Conceding the fact that Gussie Fink-Nottle, against all the ruling of the form book, might have fallen in love, why should he have been {{haunting}} my flat like this?

2500|$|The {{character}} of Erica Jane [...] "EJ" [...] Barrett (Sarah Jane Morris) {{was set to}} be introduced in the episode [...] "One Last Score", which also marked Weatherly's directing debut. Weatherly divulged, [...] "With the appearance of EJ, suddenly there's a renewed spirit that Tony has always had in him – it's <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> to go Africa and rescue Ziva with McGee. [...] he acts like a goofball because that's what people expect, but in this episode he comes away from that place. We'll see what the audience thinks, but for me, he feels potential and possibility {{in a way that}} he hasn't for years. EJ is a mirror, so he sees that hope for himself again." [...] He added, [...] "She's the diametric opposite of Ziva – physically, and in her demeanor, her way of being. She has her eccentricities as well, which makes her adorable to Tony and highly irritating to Ziva." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edge gave it 7/10, saying [...] "the {{game has}} taken a unique formula and diluted it". VentureBeat gave it 7.5/10 saying [...] "Absolution aims high but misses the mark." [...] Eurogamer gave it 7/10 saying [...] "Agent 47 doesn't begin Hitman: Absolution with amnesia, but the six years that have passed since we last took control of him in Blood Money do seem to have dulled his creators' {{recollections}} of <b>what</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> so popular in the first place." [...] GameSpot gave it 7.5/10 saying [...] "Hitman: Absolution's vivid world and enjoyable stealth-action gameplay overshadow its few notable inconsistencies." [...] IGN gave it 9/10 saying [...] "It’s {{nice to have a}} game that doesn’t just encourage improvisation; it requires it." [...] Forbes and Kotaku both gave Absolution positive reviews. Giant Bomb gave it 4/5, as did Joystiq. Destructoid gave it 8.5/10. GameArena gave the game a 3/10 saying [...] "IO Interactive needs to restart from the Blood Money checkpoint and try again— they screwed up this run spectacularly." ...|$|E

Some years later when he was asked by the Swedish Social Democratic Party's leader Hjalmar Branting <b>what</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a socialist, Nerman answered that it had been the questioning of religion.|$|R

60|$|So {{superior}} had he shown himself, that he {{was appointed}} to read the Gospel, a choice that almost shocked him, knowing that <b>what</b> had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> excel had been an experience that the younger men had happily missed. But the mark of approval was compensation to his parents and sisters for the disappointment of the last year, and the only drawback was fear {{of the effect of}} the long ceremonial, so deeply felt.|$|R
