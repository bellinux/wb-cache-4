Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, slit lamp and fundus examination, applanation tonometry, keratometry, biometry, optical coherence tomography, Scheimpflug imaging were done for extensive evaluation.

The significance of difference was measured by Chi-square test or unpaired t-test or ANOVA <b>whichever</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate.</b> P < 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant.

The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sans—a font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of networks with specified complex terminations is presented. The specification function is realized within a multiplicative constant. The technique presented differs somewhat from present methods employed in {{the synthesis of}} networks with resistive terminations. The technique is one of rearranging a transfer function and separating the specified load. The remaining portions are associated with realizable network functions which are synthesized by classical methods. The load is then added to the synthesized network. Through the analysis of a terminated network {{by the use of}} Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, the transfer function of the network can be generated in terms of the network characteristics and the termination. Having derived the general expression for the transfer function of a network, it is possible to separate a given transfer function with a specified termination in such a manner that it can be associated with the general expression. This separation process is the foundation of many of the operational steps of the procedure. In cases where the load is not already in the expression or not readily separable, it is inserted by multiplying and dividing or by adding and subtracting, <b>whichever</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The separation, however, must yield network functions which are realizable. That is, driving point specifications must be positive real and transfer functions must satisfy similar requirements except that the degree of s in the numerator only has to be equal to or less than the degree of s in the denominator. The separation procedure consists of introducing a function, X (s), and then dividing the numerator and denominator of the transfer function by this function, X (s) is selected in such a manner that the restrictions placed on the expressions associated with the network specifications are maintained. A network can now be realized using a conventional method that is appropriate. The network is then connected to the termination and the overall transfer function is represented within a multiplicative constant...|$|E

Settings and Design: This is a retrospective cohort study in which charts of all adult patients with moderate-to-severe HV who underwent scarf osteotomy from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed. Subjects and Methods: Between 2011 and 2014, 39 patients (41 feet) who underwent scarf osteotomy for correction of HV deformity were retrospectively evaluated. Standard weight-bearing dorsoplantar radiographs were obtained pre- and postoperatively. HV angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA) and distal metatarsal articular angles (DMAA) were measured pre- and postoperatively to evaluate {{the efficacy}} of the surgery. The complication rate was reported. The average follow-up was 13. 5 months, and the patients' mean age was 37 years.

40|$|Background: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic {{skin disease}} having effects on other organs. It {{has been linked}} to {{diabetes}} mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia. All of these components ultimately increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidities. Several studies have been done in the western world to identify the presence of metabolic syndrome (or its components) in psoriatic patients. Aims and Objectives: Our study had been done with the objective of identifying the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in psoriatics in comparison to normal population. Materials and Methods: The study was an institution-based case-control study. Subjects were recruited after obtaining informed consent. Cases of psoriasis were diagnosed clinically, and unrelated healthy volunteers served as controls. Inclusion criteria for cases were patients of clinically diagnosed psoriasis without any co-existent immune-suppressed conditions such as HIV, malignancy, or any other physiological conditions such as pregnancy or lactation that might influence metabolic syndrome. Smokers and alcoholics were also excluded from the study. Metabolic syndrome was defined by Adult treatment panel III criteria. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics were expressed as range, mean ± standard deviation, frequencies (number of cases), and <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate.</b> For analytical statistics, numerical data were analyzed using t-test or ANOVA test, and for categorical data, Chi-square and Fischer′s exact test were used.

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained for the relationships between risk factors and ILD in PM/DM using either fixed- or random-effects models, <b>whichever</b> <b>were</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias assessments were also performed. Twenty-three studies were selected for a meta-analysis that included 834 patients and 1245 control subjects. Risk factors that may have increased the risk of developing ILD in PM/DM patients included older age at diagnosis (SMD, 0. 35; 95 % CI, 0. 18 - 0. 52; P < 0. 0001), arthritis/arthralgia (OR, 3. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 99 - 5. 04; P < 0. 00001), fever (OR, 2. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 42 - 3. 76; P = 0. 0007), presence of anti-Jo- 1 antibodies (OR, 3. 34; 95 % CI, 2. 16 - 5. 16; P < 0. 00001), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; SMD, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 32 - 0. 64; P < 0. 00001), presence of anti-MDA 5 antibodies (OR, 18. 26; 95 % CI, 9. 66 - 34. 51; P < 0. 00001), and elevated C-reactive protein level (CRP; OR, 3. 50; 95 % CI, 1. 48 - 8. 28; P = 0. 004). Meanwhile, malignancy (OR, 0. 36; 95 % CI, 0. 18 - 0. 72; P = 0. 004) reduced the risk of developing ILD in PM/DM patients. Our meta-analysis results suggest that the association between PM/DM and ILD may be due to such risk factors as older age at diagnosis, arthritis/arthralgia, fever, presence of anti-Jo- 1 antibodies, elevated ESR, presence of anti-MDA 5 antibodies, and elevated CRP level, while malignancy was associated with a reduced risk of developing ILD. Thus, these variables may be used to guide screening processes for ILD in patients with PM/DM...|$|R
