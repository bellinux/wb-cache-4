5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the first}} generations of Plato's students, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> memory of Plato's oral teaching, {{which was written}} up by many of them and {{influenced}} {{the literature of the}} period (much of which no longer survives today). The unwritten doctrines were vigorously criticized by Aristotle, who examined them in two treatises named 'On the Good' and 'On Philosophy' (of which we have only a few fragments) and in other works such as his Metaphysics and Physics. Aristotle's student Theophrastus also discussed them in his Metaphysics.|$|E

25|$|Fans of chivalry {{have assumed}} {{since the late}} medieval period {{that there was a}} time in the past when chivalry <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> institution, when men acted chivalrically, when chivalry was alive and not dead, the {{imitation}} of which period would much improve the present. This is the mad mission of Don Quixote, protagonist of the most chivalric novel of all time and inspirer of the chivalry of Sir Walter Scott and of the U.S. South: to restore the age of chivalry, and thereby improve his country. It is a version of the myth of the Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} made Superboy's human {{physiology}} genetically {{similar to that}} of a Kryptonian was done in such detail that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> solar battery like Superman, had a weakness to Kryptonite radiation that made him physically ill, and it was theorized that there was a possibility for him to gain superpowers that did not derive from tactile telekinesis when he matured like Superman or if Superboy was aged to full adulthood as planned by Project Cadmus. As explained by his alternate timeline counterpart Black Zero and shown when Superboy himself was aged to an adult by Klarion, Superboy gained new powers such as heat vision and super hearing when he matured to full age as well as gained a higher form of increased telekinesis, strength and greater invulnerability.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, certain {{leaders of}} the Arya Samaj held {{discussion}} and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam {{and asked for a}} sign to prove that Islam <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to Hoshiarpur upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as chilla-nashini. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the matters}} before the new, Tillman-controlled {{legislature}} was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891—until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There {{was a call}} from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had {{played a major role}} in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), [...] "to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> symbol".|$|E
