In the new words, Jorge González Rios criticized both {{economic}} groups and various right-wing politicians in the chorus: [...] "Quiero más Luksic, quiero más Angelini; quiero más UDI, quiero más Pinocheques; quiero más Büchi, quiero más Lavín; quiero más libras, quiero más dólares" [...] (I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Luksic, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Angelini, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> UDI, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Pinocheques, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Büchi, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Lavín, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> pounds, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> dollars).

25|$|Stuart's {{first novel}} was Trees of Heaven (1940). Set in rural Kentucky, the novel {{tells the story}} of Anse Bushman, who loves working the land and <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> land.

The novel also {{received}} critical praise and won the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Award for the best Southern book of the year. In 1974, Gale Research (in American Fiction, 1900-1950) identified Jesse Stuart as one of the forty-four novelists {{in the first half of}} the 20th century with high critical acclaim.

25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysts {{diagnose}} uncertainty as {{the dominant}} attitude {{to life in the}} postmodern society. This uncertainty can be caused by the pressure which is executed from the society to the humans. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve something what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life. In today's society we are in a permanent competition. Appearance, occupation, education of the children - everything is compared to a media staged ideal. Everything should be perfect, because this deep-rooted aversion to all average, the pathological pursuit to excellence - these are old traditions. Who ever <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> - on the job, from the partner, from the children, from themselves - will one day be burned out and empty inside. He is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist. Who is nowadays empty inside and burned out, is in the common language a Burnout. But due to the definitional problems Burnout is till this date not a recognized illness. An attempt to define this concept more closely, can be: a condition that gets only the passionate, that is certainly not a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion (but can lead to numerous sick days). It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. This finding in turn facilitates many undetected depressed people, the way to a qualified treatment. According to experts in the field, in addition to the ultra hard-working and the idealists mainly the perfectionist, the loner, the grim and the thin-skinned are especially endangered of a burnout. All together they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work.|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{said that}} their first album [...] "is a {{compendium}} of slick secondhand urban pop encompassing [...] G-funk synths on 'Say You'll Be There' [...] and Babyface's guitar and strings balladry on '2 Become 1'". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to [...] "Wannabe" [...] saying that it [...] "is as immediately infectious, though it's not nearly as silly and novelty-driven". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a bid for street cred", while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics, [...] "let's see: She wants to be friends, he <b>wants</b> <b>more,</b> and yet she croons, 'I'm giving you everything/All that joy can bring'? She's as confused as I am. Better to revel in the delectably frothy girl-group melody". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, {{in a review of}} their debut album Spice, said that [...] "what is surprising is how the sultry soul of 'Say You'll Be There' {{is more than just a}} guilty pleasure".

500|$|In 2001, Andrew Billen {{compared}} the contemporary cultural {{relevance of the}} series to The Way We Live Now, as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair: [...] "In previous years {{we have seen the}} anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> than old-fashioned domestic bliss." [...] The review resonated with other critics; in The Scotsman, Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of [...] "anti-Cold Feet" [...] reviews—but criticised [...] "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode [...] "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" [...] of being the point the series jumped the shark, and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.|$|E
