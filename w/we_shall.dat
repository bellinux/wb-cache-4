25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> in our first background form an image of the whole matter. <b>We</b> <b>shall</b> picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And <b>we</b> <b>shall</b> place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
