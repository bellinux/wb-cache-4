5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

[...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> and then that we realized how crazy and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, released in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists. He shot 4-of-4 from the field and made three of four free throws. On March 12, 2011, Frazier scored 22 points against Michigan State, his season-high as a sophomore, helping the team pull off the upset victory in the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>there.</b> For some reason he jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E
