40|$|Welcome to {{our summer}} 2011 {{edition of the}} ACM-W newsletter. In the last issue, we {{discussed}} how we {{wanted to create a}} newsletter that would appeal to people at every stage in their career — but <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>your</b> help to do this. Thankfully, many of you wanted to join the conversation and add your voice to the newsletter. This is evidenced by ten terrific articles written by members of the community that span everything from high school to undergraduates to 1 st year of graduate school and to mid-career computer scientists. We urge our community to continue to add to the conversations we have started here. Please consider submitting an article proposal for our winter issue with new ideas and perspectives — or challenge some ideas presented here. In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not sure who to ask, but really need an answer for.
