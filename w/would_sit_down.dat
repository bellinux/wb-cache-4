25|$|On October 10, 2006, {{an unnamed}} North Korean {{official}} {{was quoted as}} saying that North Korea could launch a nuclear missile unless the United States <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for face-to-face talks. However, few, if any, military and defense experts believed that the North Koreans possessed the technology to mount a nuclear warhead to a ballistic missile.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Blue Horse {{became friends}} with the noted artist Elbridge Ayer (E.A.) Burbank while he was visiting the Pine Ridge Agency. Burbank painted sitting portraits of the {{greatest}} Native American leaders, including Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud and Chief Joseph. Burbank painted more than 1200 portraits of Native Americans from 125 tribes. At the time, Blue Horse was eighty {{years of age and}} rode each day on his horse to pose for Burbank, who he called “Son of the Shadow-Maker.” Burbank was also an historian and his fond recollections illuminate Blue Horse. “Hardly a day passed without Blue Horse coming to my studio to visit me. He <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and smoke a little, short, strong pipe and gossip with the other Indians present; all the time he was talking he would be fanning himself with the wing of a turkey. His face usually was painted red, and he wore all the Indian clothes he had, with a single feather on his head. He was a thorough Indian, and extremely kind-hearted. His principal object in life was to try to make others happy around him.” Burbank recorded his stories of Blue Horse.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War II storyline, {{the vision}} of the Inhuman Ulysses showed a rampaging Hulk {{standing}} over the corpses of the superheroes. Meanwhile, Bruce Banner is shown to have set up a laboratory in Alpine, Utah, where he is approached by Captain Marvel, followed by Tony Stark, the rest of the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Inhumans. The confrontation leads to the Beast hacking into Banner's work servers and the revelation that he had been injecting himself with dead gamma-irradiated cells. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill places him under arrest. Banner gets infuriated at all these events, when suddenly, Hawkeye shoots Banner with an arrow to the head and then to the heart, killing him, much to the dismay and horror of the superheroes, especially Tony Stark. At an Avengers-presided tribunal, Hawkeye states that Bruce Banner had approached him and ordered him to kill him if he ever showed signs of turning into the Hulk again. At the funeral, Korg of the Warbound stated how Hulk wanted to be left alone and how his allies that he made along the way have become his family. In his video will, Bruce leaves various items to other heroes and his allies including leaving Doctor Strange his notes on the Hulk's ability to perceive ghosts and an egg-timer for the various former/current other Hulks (based on one of Bruce's more successful attempts to control himself as he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for three minutes doing nothing before making a particularly big decision and then decide if he still wanted to do it).|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] agreed Frances, {{sitting down}} and {{beginning}} to peel apples. [...] "So there is no use in lamenting, or I <b>would</b> certainly <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and cry, I feel so disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] she {{returned}} with dignity, indicating {{with a gesture}} of her hand that she <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> again. [...] "I am sorry {{to ask you to}} come so far." ...|$|R
500|$|This {{look was}} {{achieved}} by Chase collaborating with Sakharov: [...] "David wanted a look that would have its own two feet. [...] From the pilot, we <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with the whole script and break the scenes down into shots. That's {{what you do with}} feature films." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Pittston strike {{involved}} coal miners, many of {{the supporters}} of the strike were not miners at all. A majority of the support that the union members received was from women, who were a pivotal aspect of the strike. Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston, but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all. The women <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{in the middle of}} roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays. Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time; [...] "The Daughters of Mother Jones" [...] and [...] "The Freedom Fighters". At the peak of the strike around 500 women were involved in supporting the miners, most of them housewives.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Araya stated {{uncertainty}} {{about the future of}} the band, and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and discuss its future. King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering a split: [...] "We're talking of going in the studio next February [...] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out." [...] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008. Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer along with Megadeth also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.|$|E
60|$|She was {{trembling}} {{so much that}} I wanted to bring her in and make her rest; but she <b>would</b> only <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on the step of the stile, and there she whispered it, in this way.|$|R
60|$|She <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> but {{stood by}} the fire dipping her inky middle finger in the egg-cup, which {{contained}} vinegar, and smearing it over the ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--with me. He is {{so angry}} that I am sure he <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to breakfast with me. So I won't come down. Will you tell your mamma? If she likes to send to me, of course I'll go to her at once." ...|$|R
500|$|Melissa Rosenberg {{had been}} working on {{adapting}} the novel prior to Twilights release and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilights opening weekend in November 2008. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> at ten o'clock in the morning and work on ... until six o'clock in the evening." [...] Rosenberg spent the months of October though June 2008 alternating between writing for the Showtime television series Dexter, and writing New Moon on weekends. She and Meyer kept in touch during this five-month period. One of the key changes the screenwriter made while adapting the book was the decision to take Edward's voice in Bella's head and make it visual. This change caused the first confrontation between the two main characters, one an [...] "apparition", to be emotional. For the screenplay, the four men who Bella approaches needed to create a significant and dangerous situation, and so Rosenberg gave these men motorcycles. [...] "I added the motorcycles, [...] because... they became an important part of [...] relationship with Jacob." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, is {{a sure sign that}} this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' who want to be like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three studios {{were used}} to produce the album, those being Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California, and HQ in San Rafael, California. On January 1, 2007, Ulrich stated in an {{interview}} with Revolver that the band would be conceiving the album much like they did their albums prior to working with ex-producer Bob Rock; they <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> write a select amount of songs, then enter the studio to record them. He also quoted Rubin by saying [...] "Rubin didn't want them to start the recording process until every song {{that they were going to}} record was as close to 100 percent as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|A drunken man, {{living in}} one of these villages, could never hope to get home. He <b>would</b> have to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> outside, and wait till his head was clear.|$|R
6000|$|... "There will never, {{never be}} any rupture, Mary. If {{you were to}} shut your door against me, I <b>would</b> come and <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on the doorstep, which I once--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{asked me}} if I <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> and he offered me one of the camp-stools {{at the door of}} the marquee, and I did <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for a moment, while he flitted about the {{interior}} doing various little things. At last I said, [...] "How is this, Robert? I thought you had been assigned to a place in the communal refectory. You're not here on the old terms?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Thérèse adhered {{strictly}} {{to the rule}} which forbade all superfluous talk during work. She saw her sisters together only in the hours of common recreation after meals. At such times she <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> beside whomever she happened to be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. [...] "We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof", {{she was in the}} habit of remarking. [...] "When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job {{to come up with a}} way to fix them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then on {{a summer}} night it came to pass, [...] While the great banquet lay along the hall, [...] That Galahad <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in Merlin's chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he {{explained}} seriously, [...] "what I think I mean is this--you're {{one of the}} people who somehow contrive to meet any call that is made on them. You <b>would</b> never <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> helpless, in a trying situation; you'd find some way of getting over the difficulties. It's a gift more useful than genius." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “We all loved him, but our {{relationship}} with him was a little formal. In fact, his younger brother <b>would</b> not even <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in his presence, such was the respect he commanded.” ...|$|R
60|$|The dinner {{consisted}} of two fowls cut in half and grilled over a fire, fried plantains, and, to the astonishment of the travelers, green peas, followed by cold boiled rice over which honey had been poured. Their host had placed plates only for two, but they <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> until he had consented to join them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it Surgeon Haggarty of Gloucester Street ye mean? The black Papist! D'ye {{suppose that}} the Molloys <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to table with a {{creature}} of that sort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss O'Mahony, if you <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> for a moment, I have a {{proposition}} {{to make to}} you. I {{think that it is}} one to which you may be induced to listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{should there}} be to be done? If you do remain here I wish you <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> Mr. Greenwood. You oppress me by {{standing}} up in that way {{in the middle of}} the room." ...|$|E
60|$|Aspel was resolute, however; he <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> {{though he}} had no {{objection}} to the mountain dew. Accordingly, the bottle was produced, and a full glass was poured out for Aspel, who quaffed off the pure spirit with a free-and-easy toss and smack of the lips, that might have rendered one of the beery old sea-kings envious.|$|R
6000|$|Macallister looked thoughtful. [...] "Weel," [...] he said, [...] "that is a reason. Jacinta {{thinks a}} good deal of me, an' if I was no married already I would show ye how to make up to her. I <b>would</b> not <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> a long way off, an' look at her. She's no liking ye any the better for that way of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo, [...] "we will; only, mother, if you <b>would</b> let us <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{here and}} read it--and then, {{if there is}} any thing which we cannot understand, you can tell us what it means." ...|$|R
60|$|No, I won't sit down. This ain't the 'ouse that {{a gentleman}} <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in. I'll be even with 'im yet. I'll {{tell the jury}} a pretty story. He deserves to be strung up, he does.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} hand in hers; afraid that he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> again, she yet could not help a soft glance into his eyes, and a little rush of pitying warmth in the {{pressure}} of her hand.|$|E
60|$|He {{decided he}} <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in the {{armchair}} {{and go to}} sleep. He crept very carefully to the chair and sat down. Another interval of listening and {{he closed his eyes}} and composed himself for slumber.|$|E
60|$|But {{he did not}} in {{the least}} object to tell his wife that he wanted to stop fighting; and she, very gladly in most cases, would confer with the wife of the other brave; and when they had {{concluded}} peace, the two men <b>would</b> immediately <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> together, smoke the calumet, and be good friends; and all this without the slightest loss of dignity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know." [...] Cynthia {{turned away}} with a {{trembling}} chin, and began to beat the coffee up with an egg she had dropped into the pot.
