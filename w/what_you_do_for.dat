The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

6000|$|... "They can bite, {{and bite}} very hard too; {{but it is}} very seldom they do, though they do make a {{wonderful}} pretence of being fierce. They call them the patient camel, but from what I have seen of them I should say that they are the most impatient, grumbling beasts in creation. It makes no difference <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> them--whether you load them or unload them, or tell them to get up or lie down, or to go on or stop--they always seem equally disgusted, and grumble and growl as if what you wanted them to do was the hardest thing in the world. Still, they can do a tremendous lot of work, and keep on any number of hours, and I don't know what {{the people of this country}} would do without them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} priest, [...] "there is no harm. On the contrary, I am {{at this moment}} in a {{position}} to consider it a great favor that you do me in offering me this employment. I accept it with the greatest pleasure. Oh!" [...] he cried, breaking by a sudden impulse from the composure with which he had begun to speak, [...] "you don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> me; you lift me out of despair. Before you came, I had reached one of those passes that seem the last bound of endeavor. But you give me new life. Now I can go on with my experiment. I can at test my gratitude by possessing your native country of the weapon I had designed for it--I am sure of the principle: some slight improvement, perhaps the use of some different explosive, would get over that difficulty you suggested," [...] he said eagerly. [...] "Yes, something can be done. God bless you, my dear little son--I mean--perdoni!--my dear sir."...|$|E
60|$|RICHARD. Much {{the same}} thing, perhaps. (With some {{bitterness}} towards himself) But no: if I had been any good, I should have <b>done</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> me, {{instead of making}} a vain sacrifice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shoo--'tain't nothing, Mr. Dare, {{alongside}} of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> me," [...] {{replied the}} sailor. [...] "But I've had {{a run of}} bad luck since I left New York two days ago," [...] he added meditatively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? Elbridge Newton? Well, I guess {{his wife}} hasn't forgot <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> them when their little boy died, if he has, and I guess he hasn't gone for any officer! Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> see him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But I {{think it}} {{possesses}} very great merit. My doubts arise partly {{from the nature}} of the interest which I fear requires presentation as a whole, and partly on your manner of relating the tale. The people do not sufficiently work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic action. You are too much their exponent; <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> them, they ought to do for themselves. With reference to publication in detached portions (or, indeed, with a reference to the force of the story in any form), that long stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the antecedents of the clergyman's biography, are rather crippling. I may mention that I think the boy (the child of the second marriage) a little too [...] "slangy." [...] I know the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a character in these times; but, considering his part in the story, I regard it as the author's function to elevate such a characteristic, and soften it into something more expressive of the ardour and flush of youth, and its romance. It seems to me, too, that the dialogues between the lady and the Italian maid are conventional but not natural. This observation I regard as particularly applying to the maid, and to the scene preceding the murder. Supposing the main objection surmountable, I would venture then to suggest to you the means of improvement in this respect.|$|E
