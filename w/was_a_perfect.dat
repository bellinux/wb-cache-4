5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the alien nest were shot at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> place to film because of its grilled walkways and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E
5|$|Although young, Kennedy was {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E

50|$|Proof. Let X <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect,</b> compact, Hausdorff space, {{then the}} theorem {{immediately}} implies that X is uncountable. If X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect,</b> locally compact Hausdorff space {{which is not}} compact, then the one-point compactification of X <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect,</b> compact Hausdorff space. Therefore, the one point compactification of X is uncountable. Since removing a point from an uncountable set still leaves an uncountable set, X is uncountable as well.|$|R
5|$|In {{line with}} his {{historical}} interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt (1625–1672). The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.|$|E
