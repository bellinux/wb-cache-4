5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded {{by one of his}} staff, Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was {{made clear that the}} new state <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E

25|$|Although strong {{emergence}} is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic.

25|$|Although {{attacking the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet anchor would achieve surprise, it also carried two {{distinct}} disadvantages.

Also, most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor afterward. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto and Genda pressed ahead.|$|E

25|$|In most imaging devices, {{the degree}} of {{exposure}} to light applied to the active element (be it film or CCD) can be altered {{in one of two}} ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the aperture or by increasing/decreasing the time of each exposure. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the exposure time and not the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the depth of field and so the resultant multiple images <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.|$|E
25|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water.

Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in inadequately protected divers, although it is not often the direct clinical cause of death.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Khazarian ancestry in Ashkenazi {{has also been}} a subject of discussion in the field of population genetics, wherein claims have been made concerning evidence both for and against it. Eran Elhaik argued in 2012 for a significant Khazar component in the paternal line based on the study of Y-DNA of Ashkenazi Jews using Caucasian populations, Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani Jews, as proxies. The evidence from historians he used has been criticised by Shaul Stampfer and the technical response to such a position is dismissive, arguing that, if traces of descent from Khazars exist in the Ashkenazi gene pool, the contribution <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> minor, or insignificant.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the company}} {{wanted to be}} sure that Greenside Mine {{contained}} sufficient reserves of ore to enable the large-scale mining operation which would make it profitable. They proposed taking a two-year option on the mine, during which they would refurbish the property and prove its resources, paying the landowners a dead rent of £90 per year. Many terms of the old leases they rejected as inappropriate to a large, modern mining company.

25|$|The {{doctrines of}} papal primacy and papal {{supremacy}} {{are perhaps the}} greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Roman Catholic Church and the other Christian churches.

Many Protestants are quite willing to grant the pope a position of special moral leadership, but feel that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., {{that there can be}} no intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann, {{judging by}} the want of vigour {{displayed}} in the French pursuit and by the French not having attempted to secure {{the passage of the}} Dyle at Mousty, , and Limale, considered that it was only a weak detachment that was advancing upon Wavre, confining itself to the design of creating some little uneasiness by its movement along this road to Brussels.
