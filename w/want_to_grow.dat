5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is red-haired, freckled, {{unconventional}} and superhumanly strong – able to {{lift her}} horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes fun of unreasonable adults, {{especially if they are}} pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and Annika.|$|E
25|$|There was no tour {{to support}} the album. With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents {{recruited}} Ray Cooper as both singer and second guitarist and continued performing locally for a time during 1982 and 1983. They would occasionally perform as a quintet when Aukerman would join them during his return visits to Los Angeles. The band was mostly on hiatus {{for the next few}} years while Stevenson played in Black Flag. Guitarist and founding member Frank Navetta quit the band during this time, burning all his musical equipment and moving to Oregon to become a professional fisherman. The Descendents reconvened in 1985, with Cooper on guitar, for the recording of I Don't <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> Up.|$|E

500|$|Boortz {{criticizes the}} major parties saying [...] "I believe that the {{principal}} difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do." [...] He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make {{up the majority of}} his listeners and callers.|$|E
500|$|In March 2005 Glickenhaus, stock {{exchange}} magnate and car collector, {{was approached by}} Pininfarina who {{asked if he was}} interested in commissioning a one-off car. Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company’s founder later said [...] "The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. But we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> this business." [...] indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US$4 million though in an interview he said [...] "I feel they gave me more than I expected". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica (Click link here: [...] ) [...] which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that [...] "Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar" [...] as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it.|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts.

2500|$|Many {{fans have}} speculated that this song was a tribute to Grohl's {{deceased}} friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain. However, in Grohl's own words, the song is, [...] "(his) {{way of saying that}} when I was young, I didn't have big rock heroes, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up and be some big sporting hero. My heroes were ordinary people and the people that I {{have a lot of respect}} for are just solid everyday people - people you can rely on." [...] This was the third single to be released from the album.|$|E
2500|$|The cover {{illustration}} {{was done}} by Jeff [...] "Rat" [...] Atkinson, based on earlier caricatures drawn by Aukerman's Mira Costa High School classmate Roger Deuerlein depicting Aukerman as the class nerd. Atkinson drew several versions of the character wearing different shirts, and Stevenson selected the version with the necktie for its collegiate look.

2500|$|Although Navetta {{had left}} the Descendents, one song he had written with Lombardo, [...] "Rockstar" [...] (lyrics by Navetta, music by Lombardo), was used for their 1985 album I Don't <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Grow</b> Up. Lombardo {{subsequently}} left the band as well, and the Descendents experienced more lineup changes and released two more albums before Aukerman left the band in 1987.

I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it {{took me a long time}} to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on."

2500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} The French Kissers were positive. The Gazettes Brendan Kelly, {{who gave the}} film 4 out of 5 stars, wrote that [...] "Sattouf captures that strange mix of bravado and shyness that is teenage guy-dom, {{and the result is}} both {{frequently}} hilarious and, finally, quite touching." [...] He thought that Lacoste was [...] "perfect" [...] as Hervé and that the casting of non-professional actors made the film more authentic. Justin Show of Filmink magazine described the film as a [...] "fresh and brutally sincere comedy that strays away from typical teen flicks". In particular, he praised the cinematography, Sattouf's dialogue and Lvovsky's performance. Mike Goodridge wrote for Screen International that the film shows [...] "a nice blend of humour and intelligence that places it somewhere between American Pie and Wild Reeds". He enjoyed the well-known actors' brief appearances and thought that the film's [...] "acute observations and ribald humour" [...] would appeal to adult viewers. The Hollywood Reporters Duane Byrge summarised the film as [...] "a hilarious spin through contemporary French adolescence". Berge found the teenagers' depiction [...] "farcical but realistic" [...] and felt that, like John Hughes's films, a particularly funny aspect was the mockery of authority figures. In a review for Variety magazine, Jordan Mintzer opined that the film comprised [...] "plenty of heart-wrenching gags right in the smacker". Mintzer found some sequences [...] "nauseating" [...] but others [...] "freshly and creatively slapstick", and praised the raw cinematography. David Stratton of At the Movies awarded the film 3.5 stars out of 5, describing it as [...] "a likeable insight into the problems of children who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> up very quickly". He called the non-professional teenage cast [...] "terrific", and praised Lvovsky's performance as Hervé's mother. Herald Sun critic Leigh Paatsch found the film [...] "blatantly funny" [...] but also [...] "surprisingly moving". He called Sattouf [...] "a knockout talent behind the camera" [...] and praised the [...] "great humour and honesty" [...] of the story.|$|E
