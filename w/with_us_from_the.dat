60|$|A true {{narrative}} of any {{portion of this}} world's doings must of necessity be {{as varied as the}} world itself, and equally abrupt in its transitions.

60|$|At length all was {{arranged}} and we {{stood up to}} face each other, {{the four of us}} being armed in the same way. For as did Idernes and the hawk-eyed lord, Bes and I wore shirts of mail and helms, those that we had brought <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East. For weapons we had short and heavy swords, small shields and knives at our girdles.|$|E

6000|$|For {{a quarter}} of a mile these tactics kept them unharmed, but at length they reached a wide smooth meadow, and the enemy seemed {{preparing}} to charge.

60|$|It will thus be {{seen that}} our travels would be {{hindered}} very much, if not stopped altogether, and ourselves be regarded with jealousy, or perhaps murdered, if our motives in going inland were not fully and satisfactorily explained to the different tribes as we passed through their lands.

50|$|Most of {{this section}} is a Limited-access road with four lanes in each direction, {{becoming}} two lanes in each direction as the highway continues away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern suburbs of Atlanta.

60|$|Unloading the yak, we pitched our tent {{under the}} lee of the topmost knob of rock and ate a couple of handfuls of dried fish and corn-cake.

Then we wrapped ourselves up in our thick rugs and fur garments and forgot our miseries in sleep.|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} to let him see that we {{intended}} to carry our provision <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first day; but he made signs to us to tell us we need not, for we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It {{was very difficult for}} us to understand how he expressed forty; for he knew no figures, but some words that they used to one another that they understood it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty little stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel, and find provisions sufficient.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{landed at}} the back of the Morro, and lay there all day, being purposed to do that which, with your pardon, we have done.

So that, had your sentinels been awake, they would have hardly made us out, till we were close on board. We had provided ourselves, instead of ladders, with bamboos rigged with cross-pieces, and a hook of strong wood at the top of each; they hang at your stern-gallery now.

60|$|Mr. Young, of the New York Herald, {{has been}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{time we went}} on {{shipboard}} until we arrived here. His letters published in the papers are all good, and save me writing descriptive letters. Presuming that you have read them I will say nothing further than that my winter travels, in the Mediterranean, on the Nile, and in the Levant generally have been the pleasantest of my life. I should enjoy doing it over again next winter. We have been in Rome eight days. It {{is a city of}} great interest. But one should visit it before making the Nile trip. Here you see modern and comparatively insignificant ruins, not dating back many centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. On the Nile one sees grand ruins, with the inscriptions as plain and distinct as when they were first made, that antedate Moses by many centuries.|$|E
60|$|After what I have advanced, {{it would}} appear {{presumption}} to offer a translation; even if the attempt were not discouraged by the different genius of the English mind and language, which demands a denser body of thought as the condition of a high polish, than the Italian. I cannot but deem it likewise an advantage in the Italian tongue, in many other respects inferior to our own, that the language of poetry is more distinct from that of prose than <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> earlier appearance and established primacy of the Tuscan. poets, concurring {{with the number of}} independent states, and the diversity of written dialects, the Italians have gained a poetic idiom, as the Greeks before them had obtained from the same causes with greater and more various discriminations, for example, the Ionic for their heroic verses; the Attic for their iambic; and the two modes of the Doric for the lyric or sacerdotal, and the pastoral, the distinctions of which were doubtless more obvious to the Greeks themselves than they are to us.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the Croton Expressway, {{the only}} {{piece of the}} failed Hudson River Expressway project that was ever built, began in the mid-1960s.
