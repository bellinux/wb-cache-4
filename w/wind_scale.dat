5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|Conditions were {{favorable}} for the nascent depression to strengthen. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted {{the system would}} become a Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale</b> when the system was only a tropical depression. Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 season. The storm very quickly organized, developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection; this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear. On August23, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status, and an eye began forming later that day. On the next day, as the storm rapidly intensified, the eye became much more distinct and {{was surrounded by a}} powerful eyewall. During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00UTC on August24, Marie attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale,</b> the first such Pacific hurricane since Celia in 2010. The NHC estimated peak sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h), based on a Dvorak T-number of 7.0 provided by TAFB and SAB. They also estimated Marie's minimum barometric pressure at 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), ranking as the seventh-strongest in the Pacific east of the International Date Line since records began in 1949. Coincidentally, Hurricane Odile attained the same pressure just three weeks later. At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575mi (925km) across.|$|E
5|$|Development was {{initially}} slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once {{clear of the}} unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale</b> by 18:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Able was {{the first}} named {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic hurricane database, and {{was also the first}} of six major hurricanes in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. Its development was confirmed on August12 by the Hurricane Hunters, which is a group that intentionally flies into a hurricane for observations. Hurricane Able initially threatened to strike the Bahamas, but instead turned to the northwest and later to the northeast. As it neared the Outer Banks, Able reached peak winds of , equivalent to a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale.</b> After brushing those islands and Cape Cod, Able moved ashore on Nova Scotia as a minimal hurricane.

5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane <b>Wind</b> <b>Scale.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe world's {{fossil fuel}} energy {{resources}} are diminishing {{at a faster}} rate and most importantly the liquid fossil fuel is expected to be finished by 2060 s. Moreover, the fossil fuel is directly related to air pollution, land and water degradation. The danger of climate change due to global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions compels the policy makers, scientists and researchers globally to explore power generation from renewable sources such as wind. Despite significant progresses have been made in power generation using large <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> turbines recently, domestic <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> turbines that have immense potentials for standalone power generation are not explored and adequately researched. Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study is to}} review and analyse the potentials for power generation by domestic <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> turbines for the residential and semi-commercial applications. The study reviews the current status of wind characteristics in built-up areas, economic feasibility, aerodynamic and technological limits, local government planning requirement, local and foreign small <b>scale</b> <b>wind</b> turbine manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} new <b>wind</b> speed <b>scales</b> is {{proposed}} {{in which the}} relevant scaling factors are derived from physical quantities like mass flux density, energy density (pressure), or energy flux density. Hence, they are called Energy- or E-scales, and {{can be applied to}} wind speeds of any intensity. It is shown that the Mach scale is a special case of an E-scale. Aside from its foundation in physical quantities which allow for a calibration of the scales, the E-scale concept can help to overcome the present plethora of <b>scales</b> for <b>winds</b> in the range from gale to hurricane intensity. A procedure to convert existing data based on the Fujita-scale or other scales (Saffir-Simpson, TORRO, Beaufort) to their corresponding E-scales is outlined. Even for the large US tornado record, the workload of conversion in case of an adoption of the E-scale would in principle remain manageable (if the necessary metadata to do so were available), as primarily the F 5 events would have to be re-rated. Compared to damage scales like the Ã¢Â�Â�Enhanced FujitaÃ¢Â�Â� or EF-scale concept recently implemented in the USA, the E-scales are based on first principles. They can consistently be applied all over the world for the purpose of climatological homogeneity. To account for international variations in building characteristics, one should not adapt <b>wind</b> speed <b>scale</b> thresholds to certain national building characteristics. Instead, one worldwide applicable <b>wind</b> speed <b>scale</b> based on physical principles should rather be complemented by nationally-adapted damage descriptions. The E-scale concept can provide the basis for such a standardised <b>wind</b> speed <b>scale...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent in situ {{observations}} of the solar wind show that charge states (e. g., the O 7 +/O 6 + and C 6 +/C 5 + abundance ratios) and α-particle composition evolved through the extended, deep solar minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 (i. e., from 2006 to 2009). Prior investigations have found that both particle flux and magnetic field strength gradually decreased over this period of time. In this study, we find that (for a given solar wind speed) the coronal electron temperature (as derived from O 7 +/O 6 + and C 6 +/C 5 + measurements from ACE) likewise decreased during this minimum. We use the Schwadron 2 ̆ 6 McComas solar <b>wind</b> <b>scaling</b> law to show that cooler coronal electron temperatures are naturally associated with lower particle fluxes because downward heat conduction must be reduced to keep the average energy loss per particle fixed. The results of the scaling law should apply to all solar wind models and suggest that {{the evolution of the}} solar wind is linked to the solar dynamo, which caused the coronal magnetic field strength to decrease in the deep, extended minimum. We utilize the scaling law to project coronal electron temperatures backward in time throughout the space age and find that these temperatures have been decreasing in successive temperature maxima since 1987 but were increasing in successive temperature maxima from 1969 to 1987. Thus, we show how the solar <b>wind</b> <b>scaling</b> law relates solar wind properties observed at 1 AU back to coronal electron temperatures throughout the space age...|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Michael of the 2000 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season caused moderate damage in Atlantic Canada. The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the season, Michael developed from a non-tropical {{system to the}} southwest of Bermuda on October15. The system was initially subtropical, but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October17. Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day. By October20, Michael peaked as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane <b>wind</b> <b>scale</b> at a relatively high altitude of 44°N. The storm weakened slightly to a Category1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October20.|$|E
