5|$|Detailed {{planning}} for the Tonga began in February, starting {{with the number of}} transport aircraft assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these transport aircraft then began formation flying training and specialised aircrew training to ensure that they were as familiar <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, using them to find {{the most efficient way to}} deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones. On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 transport aircraft. At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise 'Bizz II' in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Finally, between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise 'Mush' utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.|$|E
25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> learners do in the classroom than <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E

While Frank asserts that the conservative Republican Party has been able to lure working class voters away from the liberal Democratic Party, which better represents their economic interests, with value issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, Bartels points out that the working class, despite being socially more conservative, is still overwhelmingly Democratic, more so than in the past.|$|R

25|$|To {{obtain a}} straight-line {{motion in the}} {{rotating}} world, a force exactly opposite in sign to the fictitious force must be applied to reduce the net force on the walker to zero, so Newton's law of inertia will predict a straight line motion, in agreement <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> rotating observer sees. The fictitious forces that must be combated are the Coriolis force (first term) and the centrifugal force (second term). (These terms are approximate.) By applying forces to counter these two fictitious forces, the rotating observer ends up applying exactly the same forces upon the walker that the inertial observer predicted were needed.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{development}} of the game began with creating the first Hero character, Tracer, who {{was based on a}} character from Titan with similar time-manipulation abilities. They used Tracer and a single map based on the Temple of Anubis, to test how well the core mechanics played, according to assistant game director Aaron Keller. They added three more HeroesWidowmaker, Reaper, and Pharah, all whom had been developed from Crossroads classesto start polishing the gameplay mechanics, which even at this stage Keller stated that it compared very closely <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> released game would present.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E
