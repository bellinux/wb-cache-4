Catfield fen is well known amongst Broadland ecologists {{as one of the}} most important areas of fen in the United Kingdom. The wide variety of plant communities support many rare species. The site is especially important for invertebrates, with an internationally important aquatic beetle assemblage including many Red Data book species. Other rare invertebrates include the Swallowtail butterfly, the lesser <b>water</b> <b>measurer,</b> small dotted footman moth and Fenn's wainscot moth.|$|E

In order to detect subtle behavioural changes induced {{by the presence of}} resistance genes, we used natural predators and compared their differential predation on susceptible and resistant Culex pipiens mosquitoes, using strains with a similar genetic background. Resistance genes were either coding an overproduced detoxifying esterase (locus Ester), or an insensitive target (locus ace- 1). Differential predation was measured between susceptible and resistant individuals, as well as among resistant mosquitoes. A backswimmer, a <b>water</b> <b>measurer,</b> a water boatman and a predaceous diving beetle were used as larval predators, and a pholcid spider as adult predator. Overall, the presence of a resistance gene increased the probability of predation: all resistance genes displayed predation costs relative to susceptible ones, at either the larval or adult stage, or both. Interestingly, predation preferences among the susceptible and the resistance genes were not ranked uniformly. Possible explanations for these results are given, and we suggest that predators, which are designed by natural selection to detect specific behavioural phenotypes, are useful tools to explore non-obvious differences between two classes of individuals, for example when they differ by {{the presence or absence of}} one recent gene, such as insecticide resistance genes. 1...|$|E
