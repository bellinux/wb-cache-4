George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company that, {{as a member of}} ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings over this, his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E
5|$|To Rae's displeasure, {{her school}} is soon merged with Newt's. She rebuffs his {{attempts}} to talk to her, and after gaining employment at the local diner, is further dismayed to find that Newt works there. She tries to have him fired, but eventually accepts that they must work together. After she is locked in a cupboard by Lauren, Rae reveals that she is claustrophobic and believes she is cursed. She tells Newt that both of her sisters died before their 18th birthdays and she believes the same <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> her. Newt helps Rae to overcome her fear of the curse, and she agrees to move to Scotland with him. However, her grandmother suffers a stroke shortly before her planned departure, so she decides to stay in Hollyoaks to care for her.|$|E

5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the Halperts in a long time.|$|E

25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference {{is that we are}} in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{appreciation}} of total adult control is also considered vital, and information, {{such as how}} long a child will be with therapeutic foster parents or what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him or her next, is deliberately withheld.

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

25|$|On July 15, 2015, WADL added Grit to 38.2, moving Get TV to 38.3 in the process. This caused The Word Network to be {{temporarily}} {{removed from}} the station' subchannel entirely. The Word Network eventually returned to WADL on September 18 of that year, replacing Antenna TV on 38.4. WADL will add Cozi TV to 38.4 on February 1, 2016, displaced from WMYD 20.2 by Antenna TV. It is unknown what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> The Word Network's current affiliation on 38.4, but on May 4, 2017, returned The Word Network on a newly-created fifth subchannel, and added Justice Network to the new 38.6 subchannel.

25|$|Intentional acts {{of cruelty}} {{can lead to}} {{multiple}} years behind bars. These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually hurt or killed {{one or more of}} their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets. Battered women report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E
25|$|Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan {{formed the}} OCAC in 1991 as Central Asian Commonwealth (CAC).

25|$|The notch {{signaling}} {{mechanism is}} an example of juxtacrine signaling (also known as contact-dependent signaling) in which two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell differentiation during embryonic development. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, two cells of the developing gonad each have an equal chance of terminally differentiating or becoming a uterine precursor cell that continues to divide. The choice of which cell continues to divide is controlled by competition of cell surface signals. One cell <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> produce more of a cell surface protein that activates the Notch receptor on the adjacent cell. This activates a feedback loop or system that reduces Notch expression in the cell that will differentiate and that increases Notch {{on the surface of the}} cell that continues as a stem cell.|$|E
25|$|Amodini {{was made}} in 1996. It was a one-hour forty five minutes family comedy. Casting {{included}} Aparna Sen, Rachana Banerjee, Anusree Das and Pijush Ganguly, among others. A satirical Indian fairy tale, it {{is set in the}} perspective of 18th century, when traditional social customs were strictly enforced and complied. The storyline is about the exploits of a pretty and spoiled daughter of a rajah (king) who is forced to become the bride of her 15-year-old Brahmin houseboy after the man she was supposed to marry jilts her on her wedding day. If she does not marry before sunset, something horrible <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> her; therefore she must marry the servant boy. After the ceremony, the boy is exiled and the union remains unconsummated. Years pass and tragedy befalls the rajah who loses all his wealth. Suddenly the servant boy returns, only he is no longer a servant. Now he has become wealthy and powerful enough to take the rajah's position from him. Even though by then he has married another, his former bride begs him to take her in.|$|E
25|$|Yaroslavna weeps at her {{separation}} from Igor and {{the defeat of}} his army, blaming the very elements themselves for helping the enemy (Yaroslavna's Lament). Peasant women blame not the wind but Khan Gzak for the devastation. As Yaroslavna looks around to acknowledge the destruction, she sees two riders in the distance who {{turn out to be}} Igor and Ovlur. The two lovers sing of their joy of being reunited and of the expectation that Ivan will lead the Russians to victory against the Khan. Unaware of Igor's return, Skula and Yeroshka, the drunken gudok players, sing a song that mocks him. Then they notice him in the distance. After a moment of panic about what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them, Skula says that they should rely on their cunning and decides on a plan that will save them. They ring the church bells to summon a crowd. Although people at first treat them with suspicion, the gudok players manage to convince the crowd that Igor has returned and the boyars that they are loyal followers of the true prince and not Galitsky. All joyously celebrate Igor's return.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Mike Howard, Squadron Commander, saw COIN as {{a process}} of {{providing}} three services in the Kamdesh region. Providing clean water by installing gravity fed pipelines in all the local villages, repairing the hydroelectric plants in Urmul and Kamdesh, and setting up new plants in Mirdesh and Gawardesh. New roads would be the final stage, built and maintained by local contractors, this would improve the local economy while providing improved communications with the central government {{and the rest of the}} nation. 1.33 million dollars was budgeted for these projects. This had the potential of providing a significant boost to the local economy, which in the past saw little in the way of civic improvements. Keating saw these programs as having mixed results. Villagers and clans who were left out of these projects were resentful, and quick to turn to those who would exploit the resulting divisions. Haji Yunus, a village elder of Gawardesh and contractor for an electric plant was kidnapped and murdered. A note was attached to his body which said: “Don’t work with coalition forces. This <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> you.” The note was signed “Mullah Omar”. Omar was the top Taliban leader in Afghanistan, but U.S. Intelligence stated HIG had done the killing, giving Omar “credit” in order in instill more fear due to Omar’s greater reputation. The constant ambushes and fire fights along the road to Naray did little to relieve Keating’s doubts. “The little bastards keep shooting at us every day.”, represented Keating’s assessment of the progress of COIN in Kamdesh.|$|E
