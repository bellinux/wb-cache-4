50|$|In tarot, {{the element}} of cups is water, and the suit of cups {{pertains}} to situations and events of an emotional nature - in contradistinction to physical, or mindful, or creative natures; physical would refer to understanding with the five senses, mindful would refer to mental constructs and logical sequences, and creative would refer to the agility of transcending limits, if so desired). As such, when the tarot is used in divination, many cups signify an emotional issue or love situation, or some event that affects the querent emotionally. The <b>watery</b> astrological <b>signs</b> are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Additionally, cups were {{the symbol of the}} clergy in feudal times, and thus cup cards can also be interpreted as having to do with spiritual or religious matters.|$|R

6000|$|Osborne[317] and Curll {{accept the}} glorious strife, (Though this his son dissuades, {{and that his}} wife;) One on his manly {{confidence}} relies, One on his vigour and superior size. [...] 170 First Osborne lean'd against his letter'd post; It rose, and labour'd to a curve at most. So Jove's bright bow displays its <b>watery</b> round (Sure <b>sign,</b> that no spectator shall be drown'd), A second effort brought but new disgrace, The wild meander wash'd the artist's face: Thus the small jet, which hasty hands unlock, Spurts in the gardener's eyes who turns the cock. Not so from shameless Curll; impetuous spread The stream, and smoking flourish'd o'er his head. [...] 180 So (famed like thee for turbulence and horns) Eridanus his humble fountain scorns; Through half the heavens he pours the exalted urn; His rapid waters in their passage burn.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of dietary calcium (Ca) on {{the occurrence of}} wet droppings was determined in hens fed various levels of dietary Ca ranging from. 05 to 3. 76 % for 3 to 12 days. Feed and water consumption, total excreta; and percent moisture of excreta were determined at various intervals. Hens fed control diets (3. 0 and 3. 76 % Ca) excreted well-formed and fairly dry appearing excreta. Hens fed diets with lower Ca excreted wet and loosely formed excreta within 3 days. Although the excreta of hens fed the lowest Ca appeared as {{a pool of water}} in the collectors, excreta moisture was not always significantly greater than that of the control excreta. Hens fed diets containing the lower Ca consumed less feed and water than hens fed the control diets. Upon necropsy, large pockets of water were observed in the gastrointestinal tract of hens fed the. 08 % Ca diet but not in control hens. This previously unidentified <b>sign</b> (<b>watery</b> excreta) of Ca-deficient hens may explain some of the cause of wet droppings observed in commercial Leghorns. It should also help alert producers to a possible cause of thin-shell problems produced by accidental short-term interruption of Ca.
