25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in Guitar World magazine in July 1985, Van Halen states that his [...] "brown sound" [...] is [...] "...basically a tone, a feeling that I'm always <b>working</b> <b>at</b> ... <b>It</b> comes from the person. [...] If the person doesn't even know what that type of tone I'm talking about is, they can't really work towards it, can they?" ...|$|E

50|$|Their {{language}} became extinct by {{the early}} 20th century. The tribe is <b>working</b> <b>at</b> reviving <b>it,</b> with several members learning it.

6000|$|Kea laughed, not merrily as heretofore, but a {{very sad}} laugh. [...] "It is a bridal veil," [...] she answered, {{blushing}} and stammering. [...] "I--I'm <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> at present for--for one of my family." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pomona smiled gratefully. [...] "It isn't a {{very long}} story, but we've {{been a long time}} <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and we wouldn't think of such a thing as calling it {{finished}} until our friends has heard it." ...|$|E

He left the Newswire and co-founded The Register, the UK's first Internet-based IT tabloid, with John Lettice in 1994. In the newsletter, Magee focused on {{computer}} chip reporting, and Lettice covered software.|$|R
50|$|Malik Bader as Jamal Abu Zikri, the {{suspected}} assassin, a Syrian national <b>working</b> <b>at</b> an <b>IT</b> firm {{in a building}} neighbouring the Chicago Sheraton. He was convicted of the crime, but appealed the verdict while being held on death row due to minor forensic evidence implicating him in the assassination.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} pigwidgeon who had spoken before. [...] "We will do that, for {{we are very}} anxious {{to know how to}} divide five-sevenths by six. We have been <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for four or five days, and there won't be any thing worth {{dividing}} if we wait much longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid you're {{going to}} have a very rough journey. The track's {{surveyed}} and blazed; they're <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in sections, but there are big gaps where nothing has been done yet, and they have been withdrawing a large number of men. Crossing the mountains is a tough proposition in the winter." ...|$|E

5000|$|Hopkins {{remained}} {{a member of}} IT′s editorial board and a major contributor, and founded BIT as an information and agitprop arm.

50|$|Many of the uninjured miners from Orgreave {{left the}} train and walked along the lines to their pit to start the morning shift, to avoid losing pay for the day. For miners <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Treeton <b>it</b> was too far to walk within the time and many were taken back to Sheffield by the railway.|$|R

60|$|Besides {{the nine}} Counters, it also {{requires}} one Player, AT LEAST. I am {{not aware of any}} Game that can be played with LESS than this number: while there are several that require MORE: take Cricket, for instance, which requires twenty-two. How much easier it is, when you want to play a Game, to find ONE Player than twenty-two. At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more amusement may be got by two <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> together, and correcting each other's mistakes.|$|E
5000|$|Leafnode is a {{store-and-forward}} NNTP (or Usenet) {{proxy server}} designed for small sites {{with just a}} few active newsgroups, but very easy to set up and maintain, when compared to INN.

50|$|Spark Public Relations {{was founded}} in 1999 by Donna Sokolsky Burke and Chris Hempel, who started the firm after <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Netscape. <b>Its</b> early clients were Silicon Valley start-ups and former Netscape colleagues.

6000|$|Thus {{he began}} his missionary career in Orofena, <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> good and earnest man that he was, {{in a way that}} excited even the admiration of Bickley. He started a school for children, which was held under a fine, {{spreading}} tree. These listened well, and being of exceedingly quick intellect soon began to pick up the elements of knowledge. But when he tried to persuade them to clothe their little naked bodies his failure was complete, although after much supplication some of the bigger girls did arrive with a chaplet of flowers--round their necks! ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there are}} others {{supplied}} by his own, and his sister's letters, and also by the Grasmere Journal. In the Dove Cottage household it was known, and talked of, as [...] "the Poem to Coleridge;" [...] and Dorothy records, on 11th January 1803, that her brother was <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> On 13th February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged on a poem on his own life, and was [...] "going on with great rapidity." [...] On the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey, ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{that he had}} his chance, he was {{completely}} at a loss. The sight of the face emerging from that lump of 'putty stuff' had quite unnerved him. The notion of this young man <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> up here all by himself, {{just because he was}} away an hour or two from the original, touched him. How on earth to say what he had come to say? It was altogether different from what he had thought. And it suddenly flashed through him--Dolly was right! She's always right--hang it! ...|$|E
50|$|Her first novel, Vanished, {{was written}} over ten-year period; only {{her husband and}} {{children}} {{knew that she was}} <b>working</b> <b>at</b> writing. <b>It</b> was rejected by numerous publishers and agents before agent Jean Naggar helped her sell it to Viking Press.

60|$|The {{war would}} come soon. Reinhart knew it intuitively. The air {{was full of}} tension, the elan. He left the SRB rooms and hurried down the {{corridor}} to his own elaborately guarded office in the Security wing. It wouldn't be long. He could practically feel the hot breath of destiny on his neck--for him a pleasant feeling. His thin lips set in a humorless smile, showing an even line of white teeth against his tanned skin. It made him feel good, all right. He'd been <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> a long time.|$|E
60|$|Within a fortnight, {{so quickly}} does an aseptic wound heal up again, {{you were running}} about in the sun, and I had come back, as one comes back to a thing forgotten, to the first {{beginnings}} of this chapter on my desk. But for a time I could not go on <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> because of the fear I had felt, {{and it is only}} now in June, in this house in France to which we have come for the summer, with you more flagrantly healthy than I have ever known you before, that my heart creeps out of its hole again, and I can go on with my story.|$|E
60|$|There can {{be little}} doubt now that Redwood's refusal to acquaint Winkles with the {{composition}} of Herakleophorbia IV. had aroused in that gentleman a novel and intense desire towards analytical chemistry. He was not a very expert manipulator, and for that reason probably he saw fit to do his work not in the excellently equipped laboratories that were at his disposal in London, but without consulting any one, and almost with an air of secrecy, in a rough little garden laboratory at the Keston establishment. He {{does not seem to have}} shown either very great energy or very great ability in this quest; indeed one gathers he dropped the inquiry after <b>working</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> intermittently for about a month.|$|E

While <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Subway, <b>it</b> was suggested to Nora that she try out for wrestling, and out of curiosity, she did.|$|R
50|$|Maccoby was not {{exposed to}} much sexism {{throughout}} her life, besides the wage gap she experienced while <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Harvard. <b>It</b> was proven that though she researched and published hundred of articles and books, she was {{still one of the}} lowest-paid staff members and was not allowed the same rights to faculty resources, such as the Lamont Library or Faculty Club, as the male staff. Maccoby actively considers herself a feminist.|$|R
5000|$|The Heinkel HeS 8 (prefix {{being an}} {{abbreviation}} for [...] "Heinkel Strahltriebwerke"-Heinkel jet engine) {{was an early}} jet engine designed by Hans von Ohain while <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Heinkel. <b>It</b> was the first jet engine to be financially supported by the RLM, bearing the official name 109-001.
