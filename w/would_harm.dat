5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of an}} attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in the event of an attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management indicator species. Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E

5|$|Once he {{saw that}} the Umayyads' left wing was holding steady, Ibn al-Ashtar changed tack and ordered his troops to attack the Umayyads' center, believing if he could {{disperse}} the core of the Umayyad army, the latter's right and left wings would likewise disperse. Ibn al-Ashtar himself took part in this assault and is said to have slew several Umayyad soldiers with his coterie of close companions. Amid the heavy clashes, numerous men on both sides were killed and the Umayyads were routed, Upon witnessing this, Umayr ibn al-Hubab communicated to Ibn al-Ashtar if he should defect to his camp; Ibn al-Ashtar told him to hold off because he feared his men <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> Umayr amid their anger.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when the Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this <b>would</b> <b>harm</b> their close relationship with Johor.|$|E
